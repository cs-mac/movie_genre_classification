1
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,760
<i>I don't know much...</i>

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,513
<i>But this much I do know.</i>

3
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,833
<i>You often think you're alive...</i>

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>when you're actually dead.</i>

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,917
<i>Life, real life...</i>

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,526
<i>You only find out what it is</i>
<i>when you've lived it to the fullest.</i>

7
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,108
It's time, Léo dear.

8
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,005
- Hey! Easy!
- Sorry.

9
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,716
Aren't you forgetting something?

10
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,713
Are you warm enough?

11
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,626
- It's summer, Maryse.
- They said it'd be cool today.

12
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,468
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,328
<i>Ms. Ventura's office.</i>

14
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,506
No problem.
Everything's fine.

15
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,548
Thank you. Goodbye.

16
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,386
Yes, I'm meeting him tomorrow
with the new plans.

17
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,023
Léo?

18
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,874
<i>The Le Bic Park DVD?</i>

19
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,494
It's on its way.
It should be there this afternoon.

20
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,432
Everything is ready, Madam Mayor.

21
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,302
I'm sending you my best man.
Chuck Émond.

22
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,204
No, she's on the phone.
Can I help you?

23
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,674
What?

24
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,108
His wife is going nuts.

25
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,644
She hasn't heard from him
since yesterday!

26
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,013
He'd better not be
having another breakdown,

27
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,209
because this one
will be his last!

28
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,817
Did you try his cottage?

29
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,483
No answer.

30
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,181
Find him!
I want him at Le Bic tomorrow!

31
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,344
If he ever shows up,
everything is in there.

32
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,046
Except the mayor's envelope.

33
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,845
Forget it.
We're calling off the meeting.

34
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,316
What a crazy day!

35
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,140
Fix me a drink
before you leave.

36
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,341
My good little Léo...

37
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,077
Always there for me.

38
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,044
Olive or lemon?

39
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,744
Leave that, would you?

40
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,717
We're both so tense.

41
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,049
It'll do us good.

42
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,418
I could go.

43
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,152
- Where?
- Le Bic.

44
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,526
Instead of Chuck.

45
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,949
I did the legwork.
I know the file from A to Z.

46
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,036
Funny, you look
like you mean it!

47
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,556
I could use
a change of scenery.

48
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,612
I guess all you'd have to do
is go, do the pitch,

49
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,463
and you're back the next day.

50
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,910
You'll take my car.

51
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,115
What was Ms. Ventura thinking?

52
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,126
Throwing you to the lions
like that!

53
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,321
It was my idea.

54
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,694
And you're telling me now?
Right before you leave?

55
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,316
I didn't want to talk about it
all night.

56
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,239
This is insane,
if you ask me!

57
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,434
Enough already.

58
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,876
I'll be back tomorrow night.

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,448
I left my number on the fridge.

60
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,885
Bye.

61
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,913
<i>I'm telling you, Léo,</i>
<i>this feels wrong!</i>

62
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,682
<i>Call Ms. Ventura back.</i>
<i>Tell her you don't feel well.</i>

63
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,684
<i>Take the day off.</i>
<i>I'll pamper you!</i>

64
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,135
The mayor called the meeting
specifically for our project.

65
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,190
They're expecting me.

66
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,992
<i>You? Talking to all of them?</i>

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,294
<i>You can barely</i>
<i>put two words together!</i>

68
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,695
<i>You'll make a fool of yourself!</i>

69
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,893
<i>Léo? What was that?</i>

70
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,851
- I have to go.
<i>- No!</i>

71
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,652
We need help,
if you don't mind.

72
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,887
Shit!

73
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,989
- Hi.
- Hello.

74
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,104
Hi.

75
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,342
It's useless.
The tire's completely blown out.

76
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,674
And no spare?

77
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,598
There's a garage nearby.
Give us a ride?

78
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,052
Yeah, sure.

79
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:11,951
I'm Léo.

80
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,621
Léo Huff.

81
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,262
Lou.

82
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,265
And this is Roch.

83
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,718
<i>Not from around here?</i>

84
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,264
No.

85
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,963
- Quebec City?
- Montreal.

86
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,938
What's your line of work?

87
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm an engineer.

88
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,345
I'm making a presentation
at Le Bic tonight.

89
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,346
A big project
to help the area.

90
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,112
What would we do
without you Montreal folk?

91
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,147
He was born with a smile
plastered on his face!

92
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,715
This is the first time
I've been here. It's...

93
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,461
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

94
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,688
Take the next left.

95
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,037
There will be spinoffs

96
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,547
of tens of millions of dollars.

97
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,818
Tens... of millions...
of dollars...

98
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,560
We're talking 110 full-time jobs
and 125 part-time jobs.

99
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,960
And... that's not it.

100
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,896
Yes, that is it.
Believe in yourself.

101
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,990
We're talking 110 full-time jobs

102
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,002
and 125 part-time jobs.

103
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,367
Simulated-

104
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,647
- Mr. Huff?
- Yes.

105
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,875
Pauline Courchesne.

106
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,386
Delighted.

107
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,488
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Yes, very nice.

108
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,158
Ready for tonight?

109
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,619
No choice.

110
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,696
Ah. Right.

111
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,465
Here.

112
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,135
Thank you.

113
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,828
Ms. Ventura said that a thicker one
will follow if it all goes through.

114
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,986
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

115
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,296
<i>In addition to promoting</i>
<i>good family fun,</i>

116
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,395
the project promises to be
very lucrative for your community.

117
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,840
We expect to see

118
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,638
about 100,000 visitors
the first year.

119
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,745
And that's a conservative figure.

120
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,943
We have a simulated image
to give you a better idea.

121
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,382
This is the bay right now.

122
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,391
Yes, it's beautiful.

123
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,212
And this is AquaBic Park.

124
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,267
Notice the green waterslides

125
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,471
that blend in
with the environment.

126
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,940
The entire ecosystem
will be screwed!

127
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,605
Think of the jobs!

128
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,202
250 jobs!

129
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,648
It's not like
we don't need them!

130
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,549
Like the 150 Calswell jobs?

131
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,810
We don't want his crap!

132
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,255
Easy for you to say!
You have a job!

133
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,748
They won't lay their concrete here!
Over my dead body!

134
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,361
Please...

135
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,330
Go back to Montreal
with your stupid waterslides!

136
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,060
Put them on Mount Royal!

137
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,135
Shove them up your ass!

138
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,793
Yeah! Yeah!

139
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,746
It's always the same bunch,

140
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,510
the same sorry bunch
that come to whine.

141
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,919
It's like they have
nothing better to do.

142
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,751
But most people understand

143
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,605
that we're here
to make the right decisions.

144
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,456
Seems like their minds are made up!

145
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,611
In the 15 years I've been mayor,

146
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,230
there hasn't been a single project

147
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,882
I wanted to pass
that hasn't gone through.

148
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,526
Tell that to Ms. Ventura.

149
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,871
Good night.

150
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,022
FUCK OFF POLLUTER

151
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,703
Have you at least been there?

152
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,041
I'm sorry?

153
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,577
To Le Bic Park.

154
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,289
Have you gone?

155
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,954
I saw it in the distance
when I drove in.

156
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,690
It's not the same from far away.

157
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,882
You have to lose yourself in it
to understand.

158
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,427
Roch and I go...

159
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,368
used to go at night all the time.

160
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,901
To smoke and relax...

161
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,378
Sometimes until the sun came up.

162
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,479
Don't you think some things
are so beautiful...

163
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,454
they shouldn't be touched?

164
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,391
I don't know.

165
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,333
How much is this baby worth?

166
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,308
$70,000? $80,000?

167
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,970
Something like that.

168
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,206
Will the waterslides...

169
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,446
pay for next year's model?

170
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,789
Is there a lighter in here?

171
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,308
I don't know. I don't smoke.

172
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,727
Yeah, as long as you're loaded,
you might as well stay healthy.

173
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,298
Married, settled,
big house,

174
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,102
winters in Florida?

175
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,136
Do I look that boring?

176
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,435
You want a ride?

177
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,455
I'd be happy...

178
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,218
Shit!

179
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,376
- What?
- He's going to kill me!

180
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,354
What's wrong?

181
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,822
You're not out hunting?

182
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,036
Get in the truck!

183
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,044
Shut up, you fucking big shot!

184
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,171
We were just talking!

185
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,776
It's true.
We were only talking!

186
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,185
What did I say?
Mind your goddamn business!

187
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,744
So you like talking?

188
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,653
- You like talking?
- You're hurting me!

189
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,090
- Right!
- Stop!

190
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,853
I didn't do anything!

191
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,361
Jesus Christ!

192
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,044
Take your clothes off!

193
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,357
Fuck! Take your
goddamn panties off!

194
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,111
There was something
between the two of you!

195
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,663
Nothing would've happened!

196
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,569
I saw you looking at him.

197
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,970
Something was going on
there. Admit it!

198
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
You know you're the one I love.

199
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,008
Christ!

200
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,241
See this ass?

201
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,315
Who does this ass belong to?

202
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,541
It's yours.

203
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,610
And who do these
little tits belong to?

204
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,881
They're yours.

205
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,154
And this, you slut?

206
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,524
Whose is this?

207
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,170
You're hurting me!

208
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,007
There!

209
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,475
There! You like that?

210
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,216
You fucking like that? Goddamn!

211
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,388
Fuck!

212
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,398
Fuck! Jesus!

213
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,571
You should be OKfor a while now!

214
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,477
I can't fucking believe it.

215
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,721
I'll be gone hunting
for three days.

216
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,657
Don't leave the house.

217
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,455
Not even for milk.

218
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,857
Understand?

219
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,062
- Understand?
- Yes...

220
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,182
Hello?

221
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,582
<i>I've left you a dozen messages.</i>

222
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,387
<i>You're not returning my calls?</i>

223
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,720
Well, I finished late and...

224
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,809
<i>Where are you?</i>

225
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:47,056
At the motel.
I'm asleep. I mean, I was asleep.

226
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,115
<i>The car is in the room?</i>

227
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,030
No, I'm parked outside the motel.

228
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,197
I fell asleep in the car.

229
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,132
The presentation wiped me out.

230
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,145
<i>How did it go?</i>

231
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,939
<i>Léo? Are you there?</i>

232
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,417
Yes, I'm here.

233
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,868
<i>Good, listen...</i>

234
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,191
Sorry, I didn't want to bother you.

235
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,492
It's just that...

236
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,292
When I saw you before...

237
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,139
When I saw you before
with that guy,

238
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,034
I was worried.

239
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,781
I shouldn't have come.

240
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,847
It's my office.

241
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,922
I should take it.

242
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,379
Have a seat.

243
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,385
Thanks.

244
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,034
That's pretty strong lemonade!

245
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,536
If you don't like vodka,
I can fix it for you.

246
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,873
What do engineers drink?

247
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,307
No, this is fine.

248
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,165
How can you breathe like that?

249
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,495
Earlier on,

250
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,700
you saw us?

251
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,172
Yes.

252
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,439
A little.

253
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,712
Be honest.

254
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,351
Did you come here to save me
or screw me?

255
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,123
Because I've had enough of guys
trying to get into my pants!

256
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,456
OK, fine.

257
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,959
I think I'll go.

258
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,427
I'm sorry.

259
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:42,287
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't like the others.

260
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,598
Really, I have to go.

261
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,837
When I saw you
on the side of the road,

262
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,380
I don't know why,

263
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,410
but I knew I could trust you.

264
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,120
You seem like a good guy.

265
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,794
You don't mind eating from the pot?

266
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,157
No, it's fine.

267
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,368
What are you doing with that guy?

268
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,461
My mother met him a while back.

269
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,515
She brought him here.

270
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,953
At one point, she caught him
making a pass at me.

271
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,115
She got jealous and took off.

272
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,519
Roch stuck around.

273
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,194
For three days, it was wonderful.

274
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,080
We only got out of bed to eat.

275
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,528
It's when we left the house

276
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,937
that things went bad.

277
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,701
If I even looked
at another man, pow!

278
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,609
And it's only gotten worse.

279
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,876
You have to do something.
Call the police.

280
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,954
I take care of my own problems.

281
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,822
And you?

282
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,159
Yourwife?

283
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,801
Maryse.

284
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,773
Any kids?

285
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,308
If she knew you were here,
wouldn't she freak?

286
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,914
Yes, she would freak!

287
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:10,075
- Can you play?
- Yes, but it's out of tune.

288
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,198
That doesn't matter!
Come on, play something!

289
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,415
No, I never play
in front of other people.

290
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,113
Come on! Please!

291
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,035
It's out of tune.

292
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,066
Completely.

293
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,811
Want some breakfast?

294
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,161
I think I should go.

295
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,297
Is there a law that says so?

296
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,301
You can go back anytime!
You're the boss, right?

297
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,269
Yes...

298
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,529
<i>You are coming back today, Léo.</i>

299
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,843
No, I'd rather not drive.

300
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,350
I don't feel well.

301
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,588
<i>I can't get along on my own.</i>
<i>I need you!</i>

302
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,386
I don't feel up to it.

303
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,458
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

304
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,766
COTTAGE FOR RENT

305
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,777
What are you doing here?

306
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,454
I thought I'd park my car here
in case someone drove by.

307
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,683
You broke the lock?

308
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,089
No, the wood was rotted away.
I barely touched it.

309
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,286
What's wrong?

310
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,726
This is how it started with Roch.

311
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,166
He started going through my stuff.

312
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,937
If we can't trust each other,
I'd rather you leave now.

313
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,112
Lou?

314
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,308
I borrowed some shampoo.

315
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,178
For supper,

316
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,159
I was thinking ravioli
or ravioli... or maybe ravioli.

317
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,430
I'm sorry for before.

318
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,962
It's a bit spicy!

319
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,226
Oh yeah?

320
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,177
So?

321
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,350
Oh yeah?

322
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,357
You're not sorry you stayed?

323
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,288
You mean me?

324
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,465
I like being with you, Léo.

325
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,268
I like being with you, too.

326
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,780
Sorry...

327
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,925
I think I'm a little tipsy!

328
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,041
I'm scared, Léo.

329
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,880
Like, really scared.
You have no idea!

330
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,183
He'll never lay
another hand on you. I swear.

331
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,286
I won't let him.

332
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,717
That's not what scares me.

333
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:20,961
I'm... I'm afraid
of what I'm going do to him...

334
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,671
when he gets back.

335
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,619
The son of a bitch!

336
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,449
If you do that,

337
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,578
it'll stay with you
for the rest of your life.

338
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,551
I'm in a whole lot of trouble.

339
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,166
I'd understand
if you wanted to leave.

340
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,704
Where do you want me to go?

341
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,935
There's nowhere in the world
I'd rather be at this moment.

342
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,915
I'd like to give you a present.

343
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,258
Go get your car keys.

344
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,680
Not even a hint?

345
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,887
No.

346
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,833
You're beautiful.

347
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,235
You're cheating!
Don't peek.

348
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,035
- Are we almost there?
- Yes.

349
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,578
I don't know you.
What if you're crazy?

350
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,809
You could throw me into a ditch...

351
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,864
All you'd have to do
is keep hold of my hand.

352
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,945
OK... don't move.

353
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,273
It'll be all right.
Trust me.

354
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,601
Get your stuff
and come with me!

355
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,511
It wouldn't do any good.

356
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,503
We have a day's head start.

357
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,515
He'd find me.
He wouldn't give up.

358
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,541
We could go far away.
Very far.

359
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,835
We could cross the border,
if you want.

360
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,422
Lou...

361
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,923
I'll give up everything.

362
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:25,961
Léo...

363
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,365
I have one bullet left.

364
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,669
You want it in the face
or in the balls?

365
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,434
- Listen, let's talk.
- Shut up!

366
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,341
Want to kiss his dick before
I splatter it all over the wall?

367
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,308
Roch... please don't!

368
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,044
Let him go!
It's my fault! Mine!

369
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,403
It's yourfault, for sure!

370
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,664
Fuck!

371
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,952
Now, let me take care of this, OK?

372
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,627
OK, damn it!

373
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,134
- Hi!
- Hi.

374
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,710
Have you heard about
what they plan to build

375
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,905
at Le Bic Park?

376
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,036
Yes.

377
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,496
Abunch of us
are fighting the project.

378
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,981
We have a petition.

379
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,610
You're a fast one!

380
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,418
Michelle.
What a lovely name!

381
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,424
- Are you from here?
- Yes.

382
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,519
My name is Francis Fradette.
My friends call me Frenchie.

383
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,130
Move your foot, Frenchie!

384
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,101
- Are you busy tonight?
- I'm in a bit of a hurry.

385
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,703
We're getting together later
at the church hall.

386
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,972
- Please move your foot.
- Want to join us?

387
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,940
Yourfoot!

388
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,791
There'll be wine and cheese.

389
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,608
Will you move
your goddamn foot?

390
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,787
Nobody talks to you like that!

391
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:01,280
I can't take it anymore!
Don't you get it?

392
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,042
You bang that one all night long,

393
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,629
and this asshole
asks you out for cheese!

394
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,830
Did you French him?

395
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,299
I did what had to be done.
Be grateful!

396
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,791
- Did he get a blow job?
- Cut it out!

397
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,753
The blow job wasn't necessary!

398
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,541
We have one guy dead outside
and anotherwho's about to come to!

399
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,742
There was something
between you two!

400
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:21,894
Let's get going!

401
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,470
You never call me "cute"!

402
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,283
Enough!

403
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,755
You have no idea
how much I love you.

404
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:36,006
If you love me, be a man
and get your ass in gear!

405
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,863
You slept with her,
you prick!

406
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,095
Untie me, please.

407
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,726
Did you sleep with her?

408
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,875
Answer me or I'll cut it off!

409
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,939
No, I didn't.

410
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,307
I swear!

411
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,139
I've always loved the smell of gas!
How about you?

412
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,867
OK, all right!

413
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:58,140
I... I touched her.

414
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,641
A little.

415
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,393
What did you do?

416
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,599
What do you mean?

417
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,803
It was really fast!

418
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,541
Ablow job?

419
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,871
What?

420
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,668
I kiss that bitch.

421
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,341
I need to know
what she puts in her mouth. Fuck!

422
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,779
No!

423
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,765
Listen...

424
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,737
I'll leave.

425
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,393
I'll never see her again.
I swear. I'll never come back.

426
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:17,009
No, Lou's not the kind of girl
you can forget.

427
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,423
After Lou,
there's no going back.

428
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,325
No, not for me.
She won't be it for me.

429
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,463
You're tied up.
You reek of gasoline.

430
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,261
And you just did my girl.

431
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,631
Believe me, you'd rather eat
a plate full of shit

432
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,536
than take what's coming next.

433
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,701
What are you doing? No!

434
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,575
No! Don't do that!

435
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,277
Listen! Stop!
I'll tell you everything...

436
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,773
I'm going to see to
our little princess.

437
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,574
Then I promise
we're going to have some fun!

438
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,579
- Léo?
- Lou!

439
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:01,089
Oh my God! I was so scared!
I thought he killed you!

440
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,058
- What's going on?
- I knocked him out.

441
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,862
No! Untie my hands first.

442
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,704
When he came back upstairs,
he was out of his mind!

443
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,811
Are you all right?

444
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,102
The gun.

445
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,559
Let go of her!

446
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,663
Let go of her!

447
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,732
OK, boss!

448
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,467
Go ahead!

449
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,337
Fucking clown!
Before you use it...

450
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,140
Stop, Roch, please!

451
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,613
You shut up!
Or I'll scalp you!

452
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,581
Hands off her, motherfucker!

453
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,354
Well, well.
The engineer has grown a pair!

454
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,152
Hands off her, I said.

455
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,995
Go ahead. Show her
how much of a man you are!

456
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,089
Aim here and shoot!

457
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:49,999
Go ahead!

458
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,869
Is that what you want?

459
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,804
Afucking pussy
who can't even defend you?

460
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,034
Fuck you!

461
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,985
Léo...

462
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,528
Fuck!

463
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,771
Let's stay calm.

464
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,498
Keep cool.

465
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,571
Look at me.

466
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,181
What's done is done.

467
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,109
There's no turning back.

468
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,221
We have to call the police.

469
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,282
That's not an option
for a girl like me.

470
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,285
We have to get rid of the body.

471
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,396
We'll throw him in the river.

472
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,864
Give me the gun.

473
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,669
Are you OK?

474
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,339
Bring your car
to the back door.

475
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,778
Open the trunk.

476
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,166
No more of this.

477
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,476
OK, help me
get him out of here.

478
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,746
We didn't have any choice.

479
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,163
It was him or us.

480
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,963
Exactly.

481
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,221
That's good.
We've gone far enough!

482
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,502
We have to go back after!

483
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,806
We'll vanish, just the two of us.

484
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,836
Without a trace.

485
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,173
And start again somewhere else.

486
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,613
Every day will be perfect.

487
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,052
Every single day.

488
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,090
It won't be that easy.

489
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,992
- We need money.
- I have money.

490
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:13,394
- Yourwife? Your job?
- I'll do what I have to do.

491
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,229
I can make it happen.

492
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,665
I don't want to hang around here.

493
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,359
I've got a bad feeling.

494
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,441
I just need a little time.

495
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,273
- How much time?
- Alittle.

496
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,605
- Christ! It's the engineer!
- It's the engineer!

497
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,199
- Bastard!
- Go home!

498
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,770
- Screw off!
- Go away!

499
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,099
Hello.

500
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,942
Sit down.

501
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,380
I prefer to stand,
if that's OK.

502
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,843
Sit down!

503
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,894
Who do you think you are?

504
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,898
I leave you tons of messages.

505
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,800
You hang up on me.
And then not a word!

506
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,564
Things are piling up
at the office.

507
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,231
What happened?

508
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,003
I...

509
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,514
You what?

510
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,177
I met someone.

511
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,547
Awoman.

512
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,023
Did she do that to you?

513
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,127
Yeah.

514
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,264
Well, your nose
is pretty clean, so I guess

515
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,819
I can let this one go.

516
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,105
But we have to make up
for lost time.

517
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,199
Why do you want to ruin Le Bic?

518
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,174
Have you ever been there?

519
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,383
Do you know how beautiful it is?

520
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,335
If this is how
you pitched the project...

521
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,257
I'm not coming back to work.

522
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,727
- What do you mean?
- I quit.

523
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:04,898
Hold on!

524
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,036
My keys?

525
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,770
This is my fault.

526
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,873
I shouldn't have sent you there.

527
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,110
You're stressed out.
You're exhausted.

528
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,961
No, actually, I feel fantastic.

529
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,911
Come on, this isn't you!

530
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,445
Take a few days...

531
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,942
Relax. We'll talk about it later.

532
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,656
You've known this woman
for how long?

533
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:28,724
Three days?

534
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,419
Yes.

535
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,372
After 22 years?

536
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:54,076
There's nothing left, Maryse,
except our old habits.

537
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,949
I love our old habits!

538
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,288
I love you!

539
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,459
Léo, there'll be a draft!

540
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,861
Crazy trip! What was she thinking,
sending you there?

541
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,486
I'll never thank her enough.

542
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,334
It's her!
That's what it is!

543
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,314
Ms. Ventura...
I guess I knew it all along!

544
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,942
No, stop it.

545
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,216
The way she looks at you!

546
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,314
Maryse... I quit my job.

547
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,790
I'm not going back to work.

548
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,523
I don't understand.

549
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,161
There's nothing to understand.

550
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,584
I just can't do this anymore!

551
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,999
How am I going to get along
without you?

552
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,905
And you? Without me?
Without your job?

553
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,574
Think about it for two minutes.

554
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,510
How are we going to live?

555
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,747
Oh, I don't feel good.
Not good at all!

556
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,888
You're tired. It's late...

557
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:12,255
I'll give you your shot
and you can go to bed.

558
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,625
How am I supposed to sleep?

559
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,231
I'll give you
a little something.

560
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,172
<i>I think I can scrape together</i>
<i>$125,000 or $150,000.</i>

561
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,004
<i>That won't last long.</i>

562
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,575
<i>Think of your lifestyle.</i>
<i>All the nice things you have.</i>

563
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,477
With you, I'd leave
with $10 in my pocket!

564
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,818
<i>Wait until two years from now</i>
<i>when we're broke.</i>

565
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:40,055
<i>I won't be</i>
<i>anywhere near as cute then.</i>

566
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,752
There's anotherway,
but it's complicated.

567
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,761
<i>I can't stay here.</i>
<i>I'll go crazy!</i>

568
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,396
<i>I feel like the cops</i>
<i>will show up any minute!</i>

569
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,195
Getting that much money
together isn't easy.

570
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,750
<i>Try harder, Léo!</i>

571
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,852
<i>A guy like you has clout!</i>

572
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,773
<i>I want it to work out for us.</i>

573
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,609
<i>I want to put all the chances</i>
<i>on our side.</i>

574
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,770
Me too.

575
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,982
<i>The power of attorney</i>
<i>is only for your joint account.</i>

576
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,233
Your wife has to sign
for the rest.

577
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,621
We've known each otherfor ages.

578
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,994
She's really
under the weather these days.

579
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,098
I'd like to avoid
making her go out.

580
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,087
I'll do something for you.

581
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:36,573
I'll give you all this
and you have her sign it at home.

582
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,817
For our good customers,

583
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,378
we can always find a way
to work things out!

584
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,979
Thank you.

585
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,421
Have a good day!

586
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,646
Don't you find it
small in here sometimes?

587
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:24,892
Sit down.

588
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,697
It's time for
a serious heart-to-heart, Léo.

589
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,550
We want to know what happened
at Le Bic.

590
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,459
I told you.

591
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,403
Like you told me
about the woman you met there?

592
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,238
I'm ready to forgive you.

593
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,506
I think...

594
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,647
All I want is the truth.

595
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,712
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, there's something else.

596
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,654
I had my carwashed.

597
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,390
They found this in the front seat.

598
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,161
- I went hunting.
- Hunting? Right!

599
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,870
You're against hunting!

600
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,104
Léo, that's enough...

601
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,937
You want the whole truth?

602
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,101
Yes.

603
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,445
I'm warning you:
I won't hold back.

604
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,180
We'll sit down over a coffee,

605
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,843
and I'll tell Maryse everything.

606
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,009
Everything.

607
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,752
Tell me what?

608
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,694
What's going on?

609
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,714
I'm in trouble, Maryse.

610
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,919
- Shouldn't you go to the police?
- No.

611
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,430
Definitely not.

612
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,969
I need money.

613
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,570
I need a lot of money.

614
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,012
I don't know
where that bullet came from,

615
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,174
but there's one thing I do know:

616
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,517
You're not playing me
for the fool anymore!

617
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,318
And you won't get your hands
on our savings.

618
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,822
Tomorrow morning, first thing,
I'm calling the bank.

619
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,424
It's my money.
I'm the one who earned it!

620
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,394
It's no more yours than mine.

621
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,966
And it's definitely not
your little whore's!

622
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,027
I just want half!
My half!

623
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,627
Not in my lifetime!

624
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,673
You won't get a penny!

625
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,871
You've lost yourway,
my poor little Léo.

626
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,809
You're living in a bubble.

627
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,073
And when it bursts,

628
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:35,741
you'll have nothing.

629
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,484
I'm defrosting a pork roast
for supper.

630
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:47,052
I'm cooking it in milk,
just the way you like.

631
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,656
In case you're interested.

632
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,791
That's my job.

633
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:32,789
I don't want
to talk about it ever again.

634
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,084
Things will get back to normal.

635
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,237
Go get ready.
I'll be right there.

636
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,863
Life isn't perfect, you know.

637
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,893
You have to make do.

638
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,232
And appreciate what you've got.

639
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,194
That's the problem, really.

640
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:21,013
We're happy.
We just don't know it.

641
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,514
What's taking so long?

642
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,075
I'm listening to you.

643
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,227
You know what I'd like now?

644
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,002
I'd like you
to play the piano for me.

645
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:49,008
Actually, I thought
I'd go to the bakery...

646
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,344
Some pastries
after supperwould be nice...

647
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,006
When you get back then.

648
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,518
Are you all right?

649
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,932
<i>Yeah!</i>

650
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:20,408
<i>Incredible! You can put</i>
<i>almost anything in poutine!</i>

651
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:24,140
<i>Chicken, barbecue sauce,</i>
<i>Italian sausage...</i>

652
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:27,448
<i>- How about shrimp?</i>
<i>- I've never heard of that.</i>

653
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,084
<i>We've prepared a report</i>
<i>on poutine just for you.</i>

654
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:34,852
<i>It's fascinating how big a role</i>
<i>poutine plays in our lives.</i>

655
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,256
The bullets!
They weren't real!

656
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,054
What are you talking about?

657
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,655
It's so far-fetched.
I don't know how I fell for it!

658
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:49,924
Calm down, Léo.

659
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,882
Put Roch on so I can
tell him off in person!

660
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:58,136
OK, yes, I conned you.

661
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,358
<i>But it's not what you think.</i>

662
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,145
<i>The plan was to blackmail you.</i>

663
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,013
You raped me.
Roch caught you.

664
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,015
<i>You shot him.</i>
<i>That was the story.</i>

665
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,348
Are you done laughing at me?

666
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,021
<i>The scratches on yourface.</i>
<i>Your semen in my underwear.</i>

667
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:17,772
<i>Yourfingerprints on the gun.</i>
<i>You were done for!</i>

668
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,359
<i>Except...</i>

669
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,346
<i>After the time we spent together...</i>

670
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,716
<i>the night at Le Bic...</i>

671
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,164
I couldn't go through with it.

672
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,239
All of it
was Roch's idea.

673
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,975
I had no choice!
Do you understand?

674
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,114
<i>He's lost it completely!</i>

675
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,984
<i>The guy we threw into the river...</i>
<i>he killed him.</i>

676
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,720
<i>This poor guy</i>
<i>who was going door to door!</i>

677
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,871
<i>I don't know what to</i> do...

678
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,493
Do you realize
what I've done for you?

679
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,163
Fuck!

680
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,276
He knows they weren't real.

681
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,711
Why did you change the plan?
I warned you not to!

682
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,516
I told you we had to make
the son of a bitch pay!

683
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,017
Don't panic, goddamn it!

684
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,610
He won't turn his back on me.

685
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,745
He's in love.

686
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,977
Maryse?

687
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:57,778
Léo, is that you?

688
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,840
Can you talk?

689
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,182
<i>He's in the shower.</i>

690
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,644
There's no turning back now.

691
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,554
I have to see you.

692
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,359
<i>Except no more bullshit.</i>

693
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,097
I lied to you, too.
I'm not...

694
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,434
I'm not an engineer.
I'm a secretary.

695
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,621
<i>The Mercedes isn't mine.</i>
<i>It belongs to my boss.</i>

696
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,902
I make $36,000 a year.

697
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,606
I live in a tiny bungalow
in the city.

698
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,200
<i>$153,000 is all I have.</i>

699
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:43,654
<i>It's not a fortune,</i>
<i>but we can live on it for a while.</i>

700
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,152
The days I spent with you...

701
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,924
were the best days of my life.

702
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,628
Do you love him?
Do you want-

703
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,240
That's all that matters to me.

704
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,542
No, I don't love him.

705
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,808
Do you think that we...

706
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,751
<i>I don't know, Léo. Maybe.</i>

707
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,059
I have something
I want you to hear.

708
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,189
It's for you.

709
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,259
<i>Just listen, please.</i>

710
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,251
Stupid shit!
It's him!

711
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,295
Do you think I don't know?

712
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,661
We were talking cash!

713
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,530
Don't bullshit me.

714
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,232
You don't love me.

715
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,798
You used me.

716
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:46,140
I had to tell him something.

717
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,608
Just look at yourself.

718
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,805
You're all torn up.

719
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,539
He's getting to you,
the son of a bitch!

720
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,516
I love you!
Don't you get it?

721
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,007
Lou?

722
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,175
<i>I have a plan.</i>

723
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:22,541
I have a plan, too,

724
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,094
<i>you motherfucker!</i>

725
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:27,012
I want $250,000,
not a penny less,

726
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,049
by tomorrow.

727
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,185
<i>Or a certain somebody</i>
<i>gets hurt</i>

728
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,448
real fucking bad!

729
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,022
And then it'll be your turn!

730
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,296
I love you, too.

731
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,798
You know how late it is?

732
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:36,943
It's important.

733
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,322
Are you going on a trip?

734
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,361
I need money.

735
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:53,828
$100,000.

736
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,405
Small bills or big bills,
Léo, dear?

737
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,806
Twenties.
For tomorrow morning.

738
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,206
No way.

739
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,072
But you send those envelopes
to the mayor...

740
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:09,775
and others, too.

741
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:11,084
That's my business.

742
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:14,436
If that got out,
it wouldn't be good for the project.

743
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,121
Are you threatening me?

744
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,023
Call it what you like.

745
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,928
Your timing is bad. Poor you.

746
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:26,124
The mayor called.
Her nephew has disappeared.

747
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:31,496
He was going door to door
with a petition against the project.

748
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,204
It's too controversial now.
I'm not touching it.

749
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,913
Listen...

750
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:45,234
Tell me what's wrong,
and I'll handle it.

751
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,539
You're not handling anything.

752
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:55,555
All you have to do
is give me the money I'm asking for.

753
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,425
The woman I met is in trouble.

754
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,866
She needs me.

755
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,804
And I don't?

756
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,362
Get out!

757
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,327
I never want to see you again!

758
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:05,551
Lou?

759
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,227
Roch?

760
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,198
Put the shovel down!

761
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,174
I have the money.
But not on me.

762
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,480
You won't get a penny
until I see Lou.

763
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:08,188
You should know
the bullets are real this time.

764
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:09,554
The door!

765
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:15,687
Come on out, Princess!

766
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,801
There she is.
Now, hand over the money.

767
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:31,161
It's at Le Bic.

768
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,179
In the park.

769
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:38,686
Let's go then!

770
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:56,565
When we get there, you get some of
the cash, but not all.

771
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,341
He's a riot,
this dickhead of yours!

772
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:03,477
You get the rest once you let us go.

773
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,241
Fuck you, you asshole!

774
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:07,814
What are you going to do?

775
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:10,509
You going to shoot me?
Go ahead!

776
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,168
Flush your $250,000 away!

777
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,258
Stop, you fucking psycho!

778
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,884
Why?
I'm having fun!

779
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:23,795
Stop or I'm turning
into the ditch, I swear!

780
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:30,726
Don't move!

781
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,653
Give me all the cash.

782
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,022
Not a penny less,
or she's a goner.

783
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:54,711
Right, my little slut?

784
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:14,108
- Is it much farther?
- Just a little.

785
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:17,148
Get out!

786
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:22,956
Get out.

787
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:36,967
Don't move!

788
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:39,138
Come back,
you fucking bitch!

789
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,839
That's enough...

790
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:07,442
I know a spot
near the ocean in Maine...

791
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,156
I thought for a couple of days...

792
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,938
You were ready to let him leave
with all that?

793
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,809
I want us to be together.

794
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,079
What would we have done
without any money?

795
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,599
We would've lived on love
and fresh water.

796
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:37,252
And the $50,000
I hid in my spare tire.

797
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:46,399
We're free!
Do you know what that's worth?

798
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,837
Everything is perfect!

799
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,301
So perfect.

800
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,010
I'm like you, Léo.

801
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:50,288
I want to be happy, too!

802
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,741
Forget Maine.

803
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:38,341
Look around here.
It's so beautiful...

804
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,242
It's heaven, Léo...

805
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,084
And it's yours.

806
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,553
All yours.

807
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:55,453
We're going to pray hard
for it to stay the way it is.

808
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,187
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

809
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:27,875
<i>I don't look</i>
<i>like much right now.</i>

810
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,461
<i>But I've lived.</i>
<i>Really lived.</i>

811
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:36,425
<i>True, not for very long.</i>
<i>But I've lived.</i>

812
01:34:39,413 --> 01:34:42,663
