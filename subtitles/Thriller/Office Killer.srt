1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,977
I think this is employment fraud.

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,566
If you don't intend to hire but
give the impression that you will,

3
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:18,306
then of course all students
seeking employment will apply.

4
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:19,637
Because they're desperate.

5
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,048
There might be a different
company, a different contest,

6
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,638
and a better opportunity for them,

7
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:28,608
but they'll look at Hauline
and apply to the contest.

8
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:29,768
Ho Won.

9
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:32,307
- Let's talk about it later. Alone.
- Yes, do that.

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,368
Keep going.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,790
I believe that the applicants
should know that...

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,396
we do not intend to hire them in
the second half open recruitment.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,460
If you won't do that,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,320
at least delete the false terms of...

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,090
employment.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,419
We understand, so don't
make things complicated,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,958
and sit down.

18
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,659
This is deception using one's
desperation, Mr. Park.

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,039
- My gosh.
- Chief Director Seo.

20
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,359
What did you say during your interview?

21
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,259
You said that you realized...

22
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,919
what you had to do after
seeing the three of us.

23
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:04,419
This is...

24
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,259
a mocker of the 600,000 people
who are looking for jobs.

25
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:15,689
Please remove the clause...

26
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,889
pertaining to employment.

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,419
Hauline must remain as an honest company.

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,089
Don't worry about it, sir.
I will talk to her.

29
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,419
Go back to work.

30
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,289
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:42,589
Goodbye.

32
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,389
Are you really that thoughtless?

33
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:06,565
What are you trying to do, saying
that in front of the chief director?

34
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:09,789
The chief director is the one who
put me in charge of the contest.

35
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:13,389
So why can't I tell him my opinion?

36
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,459
You could have talked to me, Mr. Heo,

37
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:18,759
or Mr. Seo first.

38
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,559
"Elimination of rank and position".

39
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,435
These are the things the chief
director said at the company dinner.

40
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,189
This is why he came in
to the meeting today.

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,239
Didn't he come to listen to
what the employees had to say?

42
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:36,119
Isn't it about time you are able to
adjust to the office atmosphere?

43
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,019
How much longer are you going to
say everything that you want to?

44
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,119
It's not what I want to say,

45
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,289
but what I believe should be said.

46
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,619
Ho Won.

47
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,965
You're no longer a contract employee
who is leaving in a couple months.

48
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,858
If you're a full-time employee of Hauline,

49
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,988
shouldn't you think about what
benefits the company first?

50
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:57,989
Ms. Cho.

51
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,489
I don't think that...

52
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,459
lying to desperate college students...

53
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,159
is a benefit to the company.

54
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,889
We can't change the
conditions of the contest.

55
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,419
Eun Ho Won.

56
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,559
Yes, Mr. Lee.

57
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:43,019
Do you think you're Yoo
Gwan Sun or Joan of Arc?

58
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,299
Why are you interfering...

59
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,359
with other people's work?

60
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,088
Mr. Lee, I was unemployed recently,

61
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:51,189
so I know how these students feel.

62
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,689
- I really think it's...
- No, no, no. Stop right there.

63
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,489
It's normal for people to
forget their earlier days.

64
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,139
And that's the right thing to do.

65
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,959
Ho Won, do you think about when
you used to crawl around...

66
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,319
at the age of one?

67
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,759
- It's not that.
- Stop.

68
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,829
Don't talk back to your superiors.

69
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,288
If a person's situation changes,

70
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,519
their behavior and mindset
should change too.

71
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,688
Just like me, an assistant manager.

72
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,589
I have class and manner that
is appropriate to my position.

73
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,218
Since you're a full-time employee,

74
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,689
you have to live and act like
a person worthy of Hauline.

75
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,059
It's going to get noisy
here because of you.

76
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:30,829
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,989
Here you go.

78
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,519
I think that the cooperation with...

79
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,259
the design team on the new
project is going well.

80
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,309
Ms. Cho has been doing a great job.
Far beyond my expectations.

81
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,329
The marketing team is
free these days, right?

82
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,219
Since there aren't many
additional promotions going on,

83
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:51,918
we've been checking on...

84
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,989
the online promotions
and existing projects.

85
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,539
It's hard not to have anything to do.

86
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,058
Also, when the outline for
the new products are set,

87
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,959
our team will have to participate in that.

88
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:02,759
I will go out now.

89
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,119
There will be an announcement about
restructuring the company soon.

90
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:12,619
I feel that...

91
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,329
the organization of the company is too lax.

92
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:17,689
If we continue this way,

93
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,999
don't you think it will be hard to
guarantee the future of the company?

94
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,319
I think it's time for a reformation
of the management of Hauline.

95
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,089
So what, then?

96
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,859
Do you intend to stabilize and reform...

97
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,789
the company by downsizing and
rearranging the people through...

98
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,735
an innovative restructuring of the company?

99
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,999
That's a good way to phrase it.

100
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,559
You should be in charge of the
plan for the restructuring.

101
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,859
It might sound good, but it just
means you're firing people.

102
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,859
If there is a need, we have to do it.

103
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,188
Restructuring without a reason...

104
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,029
will only bring opposition
from the employees.

105
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,379
Why do you think I don't have a reason?

106
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,419
I have performance records
and evaluation scores.

107
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,359
Chief Director Seo.

108
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,559
Our company is still all right.

109
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,489
If there is a problem, then it's too late.

110
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,989
I'm different from my father.

111
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,469
We have to take care of things in advance.

112
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,119
Why are you telling me this now?

113
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,959
Please compile a list of the
restructuring targets, Mr. Seo.

114
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,819
Why must I do that?

115
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,619
In an organization, if an order is given,

116
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,789
following it is your job, Mr. Seo.

117
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,919
Why do you keep asking questions?

118
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,359
I'm giving a task to the person who
is most qualified for the job.

119
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,219
I can't take my eyes off of you.

120
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,109
I never know when you're
going to cause trouble.

121
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:49,389
Mr. Seo.

122
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,839
I thought it was because you thought
you weren't going to live long.

123
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,659
Now you know you will, so is it all
right for you to act this way?

124
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,379
Are you prepared to deal with it?

125
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:01,659
We're not...

126
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,989
beggars who pick up and feed off...

127
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,989
false hope.

128
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,489
You don't know...

129
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,119
how desperate we are.

130
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,089
You all don't know how
much hope we lay on...

131
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,089
that kind of phrases and words.

132
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,070
You can't treat us like that
just because you don't know.

133
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,388
You can't walk all over us just because...

134
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:34,159
it's not your hope.

135
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,159
Are you done crying?

136
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,389
You probably don't know...

137
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,859
how it feels to smile
even when you're upset...

138
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,689
or how it feels not to
be able to protest...

139
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,159
even when things are unfair.

140
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,689
I've been having the same
feelings a lot these days.

141
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,119
Really?

142
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,259
Do you know why no one is
saying anything about...

143
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,219
the unfair requirement of the contest?

144
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,059
It's because they're desperate.

145
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,929
They know that if they make
an objection and lose favor,

146
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,989
the company will say,

147
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,789
"Don't apply then."

148
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,429
I know what you mean.

149
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,959
I know how it must feel,

150
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,789
but can't you let it go just this once?

151
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,059
There is a reason for it.

152
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,159
Please listen to me.

153
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,059
You said this...

154
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,139
when you were congratulating me for
getting the full-time position.

155
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:34,428
Authorization seems like a cool
thing where you sign your name,

156
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:38,159
but you're actually promising on
your name to take responsibility.

157
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,788
As a new employee of the marketing team,

158
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,759
please make your decisions carefully.

159
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,559
That's why I'm giving you this.

160
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,919
You see,

161
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,059
I'm using the desperateness...

162
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,589
and hopes of the job seekers as bait.

163
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,959
I'm basically in charge of deceiving them.

164
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,019
This is my first task as
a full-time employee.

165
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,518
Do you want me to deceive them in my name?

166
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,219
Just let it slide this once.

167
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,689
Just look the other way.

168
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,689
I thought you'd be different.

169
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,419
I thought you'd tell me...

170
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,019
to stick to my beliefs and speak up.

171
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,959
It's been a long time since
you came to see me first.

172
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,388
When I first met you,

173
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,319
I thought we'd make a good team.

174
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,558
I will do everything in my power...

175
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,489
to carry out the new project successfully.

176
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,759
Please reconsider the restructuring.

177
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,689
I beg of you.

178
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,119
This is unexpected.

179
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,288
I heard you were the most
meritocratic person.

180
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,789
Yes. I am a meritocratic person.

181
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,758
However, I can't evaluate each
employee's performance...

182
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,319
simply based on a rating scale.

183
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,358
Numbers don't lie, do they?

184
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,789
No, they don't.

185
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,159
But that's not all.

186
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,318
If you work together with the
employees in the office,

187
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,619
you'll see.

188
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,488
Someone's number...

189
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,458
doesn't come from their ability alone.

190
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,159
Did I pick the wrong person for the job?

191
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,859
I didn't know you were
such an emotional person.

192
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:06,059
Well... I'm sorry I can't
give you what you want.

193
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,159
Restructuring is inevitable,

194
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,558
but I'll look at the list
of people you make up...

195
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,689
and think about how many
employees we should let go.

This is a review on the marketing
budget execution so far.

202
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,358
Well... Our advertisement on
the magazines ends this week.

203
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,199
We're not continuing the
advertisement, right?

204
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,489
As of now, we're not.

205
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,158
It'll be off-season soon,

206
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,019
but we've always had media exposure.
It feels a bit weird not to.

207
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,558
We're going to plan it soon.

208
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,759
Okay, sir.

209
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,489
Ms. Ha.

210
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,088
Yes, Mr. Seo.

211
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,959
Well... Is your father still working?

212
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,588
Pardon?

213
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,519
I'm just curious.

214
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:35,689
Do you have siblings?

215
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,359
Do they have jobs as well?

216
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,419
Do you have plans for marriage?

217
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:47,159
I have a younger brother. He's
serving in the army right now.

218
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,789
I do want to get married soon.

219
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,789
Why are you asking such
questions all of a sudden?

220
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,289
No reason.

221
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,689
You hardly ask personal questions,

222
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,259
so I'm a bit baffled right now.

223
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,858
Is that so?

224
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:09,058
Yes, but it still feels good.

225
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,919
It feels like you're
taking an interest in me.

226
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:14,489
All right then.

227
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,019
Goodness. I didn't know anything...

228
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,289
about the employees.

229
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,858

this seems fun and interesting.

Also,

237
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,919

Mr. Seo might see us. Stop.

243

You're being so ridiculous together.
What a nice thing to watch.

244
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,059
Don't mind me. Keep holding hands.

I just tell everyone?

I don't do anything, but I'm tired.

286
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,889
Maybe it's an occupational illness.

287
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,889
Fatigue and indigestion.

288
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,259
I thought I saw you get up early and study.

289

- Are you really?
- No.

291
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,489
I'm waiting to tell Ji
Na this weekend, but...

292
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,495
I'm taking the test to become
a Korean cuisine chef.

293
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,319
Korean cuisine chef?

294
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,629
My parents run a restaurant.

295
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,689
It isn't big, but they had it for a
while, so they have many regulars.

296
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,159
Then will you be running a restaurant?

297
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,488
After seeing you guys
become permanent employees,

298
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:06,759
I thought a lot about what
I should do going forward.

299
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,818
Mr. Heo said they'd extend your contract...

300
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,918
and that you can try next time.

301
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,688
They aren't going to hire
in the second half anyway.

302
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,689
A contract extension is meaningless.

303
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,689
But more than that,

304
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,589
I thought about what I wanted to do.

305
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,128
My dream was to live an average life,

306
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,159
fall in love, and have kids.

307
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:32,089
What a pretty life.

308
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:35,259
However,

309
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,088
I realized I was chasing the job...

310
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,159
and happiness everyone else was after.

311
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,629
Everyone else lived like that,
so I felt like I should too.

312
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:46,889
You're right.

313
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,919
I often wonder if I wanted this...

314
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:52,889
or if my mom did.

315
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,558
- I get confused.
- That's why...

316
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,259
I'm going to chase what I want.

317
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,289
I like to cook.

318
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,058
Your food is really good.

319
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,629
That's right. Your instant noodles.

320
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,889
I think my dad's cooking
skills are within my DNA.

321
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,019
Why is cooking so much fun?

322
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,219
Ms. Ha is so lucky.

323
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,258
I want to get my license and help
my parents with their restaurant,

324
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,059
and then open my own.

325
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:22,689
You're so cool.

326
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,459
You guys will eat for free.

327
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:29,989
I don't think Ms. Ha would like that.

328
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,259
You have no idea.

329
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,689
Ji Na isn't selfish like that.

330
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,159
(Your submission for the Hauline
Design Contest has been received.)

331
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,889
(Mail sent)

332
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,889
(You have new mail!)

333
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,759
I'm a college student who applied
to Hauline's design contest.

334
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,789
Will the winner really be given employment?

335
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,389
May I ask when the employment would begin?

336
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,419
(Hello. We met...)

337
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,289
Ho Won.

338
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,219
Make three copies and file them, please.

339
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,459
Yes, sir.

340
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:02,789
Darn it.

341
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,819
Gosh.

342
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:07,189
Is something wrong?

343
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,589
No, Ms. Ha.

344
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:09,919
What is it?

345
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,659
Nothing.

346
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,389
Mr. Seo is acting weird too.
What's with everyone?

347
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,918
I have a favor to ask.

348
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,189
Would you pick up a cake
on your way in tomorrow?

349
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:22,819
Is it someone's birthday?

350
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:41,819
(Sales and Marketing Department
Employee Evaluations)

351
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:54,859
Just...

352
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,189
put my name on top of the list.

353
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,759
What do you mean?

354
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,659
It's hard putting together a list
of employees to cut, isn't it?

355
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,419
How did you know?

356
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,388
I've been at the company for years.

357
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,689
I told you that I have
eyes and ears everywhere.

358
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,659
I found out for the first time...

359
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:22,319
that Ms. Cho is a single mom
raising a girl alone...

360
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,918
and that Mr. Park sent his
kids to study abroad,

361
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,889
and lives alone half the year.

362
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:31,519
Also, that Mr. Lee has a lot
of debt because he paid...

363
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,159
for his siblings' tuition.

364
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:35,519
And...

365
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:38,518
That both of my parents
are in nursing homes...

366
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,019
with dementia?

367
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,819
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,588
I never considered the
employees' personal lives,

369
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:51,319
and cared only about work and results.

370
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,559
My evaluation from last
year was not that great.

371
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,358
An old, life-long manager is a burden...

372
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,859
to any department.

373
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,389
I've been ready. That's why
I wanted to talk to you.

374
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:08,189
I thought Chairman Seo
had made you a promise.

375
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:12,019
I don't trust promises
made by people high up.

376
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,619
You are wise.

377
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,588
The chief director seems...

378
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,959
determined to train you.

379
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,319
Even if it isn't you,

380
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:24,388
I knew I couldn't last once
the new chief director came.

381
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:25,589
Whatever the case may be,

382
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,559
I'm one of Chairman Seo's people.

383
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,959
What am I supposed to do going forward?

384
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,259
You have two options.

385
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,559
Do what he says. Do not do what he says.

386
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:42,889
The difference between the
two for a salaryman...

387
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,619
Cheers.

388
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,619
It will be seen in next month's paycheck.

389
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:05,858
Why is no one here? It's late.

390
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,758
- Happy birthday to you - Mr. Seo.

391
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,288
- Happy birthday to you - Mr. Seo.

392
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:17,659
Happy birthday, Mr. Seo.

393
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,689
Happy birthday to you.

394
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,818
Happy birthday, Mr. Seo.

395
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,359
Blow out the candles.

396
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,518
You're supposed to put
frosting on the person's face,

397
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,959
but we can't since you're our boss.

398
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:34,989
Happy birthday.

399
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,289
Thank you.

400
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,119
Did you have seaweed soup for breakfast?

401
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:40,618
I'll have it for lunch.

402
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,619
Are you buying lunch?

403
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,159
- Sure.
- Yes!

404
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,519
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

405
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:49,788
Thank you.

406
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,318
You're making him feel old.

407
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,058
I know. You're supposed to...

408
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,118
put frosting on their face
so that they feel young.

409
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,788
- Shall I?
- I'll pass.

410
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:00,819
Okay.

411
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:04,058
What's all the noise?

412
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,688
We're having a party! Mr.
Seo's birthday party!

413
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:10,619
I heard from Ms. Ha. You started already.

414
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:13,588
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

415
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,418
I don't know if it is actually happy.

416
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,789
Life is torture.

417
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,819
Anyway, it's a good day.

418
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,919
Let's taste the cake.

419
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,759
- Okay.
- Let's go!

420
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,358
Happy birthday.

421
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,489
Happy birthday, Mr. Seo.

422
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:30,658
This is delicious. I haven't
had cake in a while.

423
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,059
It is.

424
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,189
- Do you want more?
- Sure, I'll take it.

425
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,819
Since you're all here, I
have something to say.

426
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,658
If it's about lunch,

427
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,619
there's a new restaurant
that just opened nearby.

428
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,619
Their sweet and sour pork is incredible.

429
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,159
That's right. You wanted seaweed soup.
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,689
Well...

431
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,359
The thing is...

432
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,419
What is it? Spit it out.

433
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:00,759
Our department...

434
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,359
is putting together a list of
employees for reorganization.

435
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,689
Reorganization?

436
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,059
What do you mean?

437
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,889
I never heard anything.
What reorganization?

438
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:21,619
Ms. Cho, did you know?

439
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:23,759
I did not.

440
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,689
Your acting improved a lot.

441
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,689
When did you find out?

442
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,819
I only recently found out.

443
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,059
Is it the chief director?

444
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,119
This is crazy.

445
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,119
That's why...

446
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:46,759
he told me...

447
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,759
not to do anything.

448
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:52,689
I concluded that it would be best...

449
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:56,259
to tell you the truth and
look for a solution together.

450
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,089
Rather than finding a solution,

451
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:03,259
I think you created more chaos.

452
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,559
If anyone wants to volunteer to resign,

453
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,559
please come to my office.

454
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,689
No, right?

455
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,619
It wouldn't affect managers and
assistant managers, would it?

456
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,789
What? Are you saying Mr. Seo has
been putting together a hit list?

457
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,659
Thank goodness I didn't
give him a frosting facial.

458
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,989
Don't worry too much.

459
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,818
They wouldn't cut young hires...

460
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,388
that just joined us.

461
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,558
People like me, who are
burdens, should worry.

462
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,159
Don't worry.

463
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,589
Right?

464
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:55,959
Why is he unloading this
on his own birthday?

465
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,788
General manager, entry-level scrub,
everyone like dropping bombs.

466
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:01,519
My head's about to explode.

467
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,389
Move, will you?

468
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,189
Darn it.

469
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,659
Who left this here?

470
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,159
To Mr. Seo Woo Jin.

471
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,359
When I first met you,

472
00:29:58,289 --> 00:29:59,859
I wanted...

473
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:02,819
to impress you at all cost.

474
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,319
I'm...

475
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,418
good at refraining myself.

476
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:09,459
You are?

477
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,789
Then why don't you show us?

478
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,689
When I met you again, you were
still just as frightening,

479
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,818
but that time, I was bold.

480
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,089
Why did I apply? Like you don't know?

481
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,058
I applied so that I can eat.

482
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,689
What about you people?

483
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,918
Do you live for the company?

484
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,259
Sorry, but no.

485
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,459
And then, when I met you again,

486
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:41,119
you rejected me.

487
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:44,119
The sales team should take Ho Won.

488
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,589
You don't do well in marketing by
being good at refraining yourself.

489
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:51,019
And her wish is to be above others,
so it isn't like she would.

490
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,418
Plus, she's irresponsible on top of that.

491
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,789
But eventually, I ended
up learning a lot...

492
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,089
while working under you.

493
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:04,019
Working hard. Taking responsibility.

494
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:05,819
Above all else...

495
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,889
Will you do anything you are asked to do?

496
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,918
You must prove your own worth.

497
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,358
The fact that...

498
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,689
we must each prove our own wealth.

499
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:18,959
I will learn much more.

500
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,888
I think I can do well...

501
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:23,819
if you teach me.

502
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,159
Meeting you...

503
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,889
as my superior in my very first job...

504
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,219
was the luckiest thing...

505
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:35,759
that happened in my life.

506
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:41,589
Thank you, Mr. Seo. Happy birthday.

507
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,319
From Eun Ho Won.

508
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,219
Do you think we really will be safe?

509
00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:00,089
It's one landmine after another.

510
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:03,920
Is this why we killed ourselves to
try to become permanent employees?

511
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:05,619
Does that mean...

512
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,059
Mr. Seo had been watching everyone,
trying to decide whom to cut?

513
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:11,988
That's not it.

514
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,989
He came clean because he
didn't want to do that.

515
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,919
He is so bold.

516
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:19,989
Ever since Dr. Seo became
the new chief director,

517
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,989
the company has become too cruel.

518
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,019
Just look at what he did to us.
He's not normal.

519
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,619
Ho Won, be careful.

520
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,019
I'm sure he isn't pleased
with you as it is.

521
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:35,019
Don't get in his way.

522
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,089
Mr. Seo told the employees...

523
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:43,658
that he's putting together a list
of people for reorganization?

524
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,818
Yes.

525
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:47,959
I just can't understand him at times.

526
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,158
In front of everyone and
on his birthday, too...

527
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,618
You must've been surprised.

528
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:54,488
No, not at all.

529
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,458
I assumed there was a reason...

530
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,418
for you to proceed quietly.

531
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:00,319
I appreciate that.

532
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,289
Not at all. Thank you.

533
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:06,058
It must've been too burdensome on Mr.
Seo to do it in secret.

534
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,689
I think he wanted to see if anyone
wanted to resign voluntarily.

535
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,159
The way he handles business...

536
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,288
is a bit out of line.

537
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:17,689
Well...

538
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:31,519
Okay. Cheers.

539
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:38,788
You've changed a lot, sir.

540
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,619
You had thought company
dinners were useless.

541
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,458
Who knows when we'll do it again?
Let's drink.

542
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,589
The reorganization...

543
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,789
How far up will it go?

544
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:50,819
Are we really safe?

545
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,618
Someone once told me that
as long as I'm happy today,

546
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:55,859
I can always be happy.

547
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:57,788
Let's worry about tomorrow tomorrow.

548
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:00,159
It's a Friday night. Aren't
you supposed to party?

549
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,588
You're changing too much.
I'm getting confused.

550
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:06,358
Really? Let's take it a step
further while we're at it.

551
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,118
Let's drink and only talk about
fun things tonight. Okay?

552
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,119
Okay.

553
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,089
Here. Cheers.

554
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:25,489
Mr. Seo. Is our company
struggling that much?

555
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,819
Why is a healthy company
talking about reorganization?

556
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,619
It's because of the chief
director, isn't it?

557
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,188
Ji Na, stop it.

558
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:38,419
You can curse anyone you
want when they aren't there.

559
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:40,689
Another beer, please!

560
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,658
Shouldn't you take her home?

561
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,759
It's fine.

562
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,918
Ji Na, when you get a new President,

563
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,688
the system changes as do the ministers.

564
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:51,889
Hang in there.

565
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,759
Mr. Seo. I really can't quit.

566
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,888
My installment savings account
won't mature for a while,

567
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,688
and I have to provide for this man.

568
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:07,158
Thank you, Ms. Ha, but please stop.

569
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:10,689
Is there a law that says the man
has to provide for the woman?

570
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,059
You keep house and be
the supportive spouse.

571
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,419
I'll work and make money.

572
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:18,088
I will take care...

573
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:20,989
of my man, got it?

574
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,419
What now?

575
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,919
I'm sorry, Mr. Seo, Mr. Heo.

576
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,489
I envy you.

577
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:31,859
Who will take care of me if I stop working?

578
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,959
Jealousy means defeat.

579
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:37,289
I hate to lose.

580
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,959
- You're so lucky.
- Right?

581
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,919
I told you to let me set you up.

582
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,559
- Like a blind date?
- Yes.

583
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,458
Yes. I have a friend who's
a really great guy.

584
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:51,588
He has looks, a great personality,
a great job, but no girlfriend.

585
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,529
Stop it.

586
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,089
Stop what? That's why I want
to introduce Ho Won to him.

587
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,658
He likes girls like her.

588
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,859
Cute with a great personality.

589
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,659
What great personality?

590
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,759
What do you mean? Ho Won
has a great personality.

591
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:14,558
You said you'd work hard if I taught you.

592
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,819
What's with the blind date?

593
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,888
Can I not go on blind dates?

594
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,029
Go ahead.

595
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:24,059
Not long ago, you confessed your love.

596
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,458
Now that you became a permanent employee,

597
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,119
just learn how to do your job.

598
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,159
Love comes before work, Mr. Seo.

599
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,589
In any situation. In any moment.

600
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,789
You do it for love.

601
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,659
So? Will you go on the blind date?

602
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:53,488
I do want to try it out.

603
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,589
Ki Taek. Beer.

604
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,588
Pour me some.

605
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:00,758
Okay. Here's your beer.

606
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:02,058
Where's my beer?

607
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:04,619
Excuse me. Beer, please.

608
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:09,919
Don't they dare cut me. I'll
set the office on fire.

609
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,359
You were so feminine before.
Why are you so violent now?

610
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:14,819
Goodness.

611
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,989
Good. Hold on tight just like that.

612
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,089
What? Can't poor people love?

613
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,689
I may be poor and pathetic now,

614
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,789
but my love will never change.

615
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:27,659
Put me down.

616
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,658
Weren't you sleeping?

617
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:31,819
Put me down.

618
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,028
There may be poor love,

619
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,819
but not pathetic ones.

620
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,459
Don't make me pathetic ever.

621
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:14,859
Mr. Seo.

622
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,958
You told me to stay still...

623
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,689
because of the reorganization, right?

624
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:23,189
You and the chief director
don't exactly get along.

625
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,119
I am worried,

626
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:28,529
but we won't touch low-level...

627
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,859
assistant managers or below.

628
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,559
What about the others?

629
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:36,819
That's right.

630
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,159
Thanks for the tie.

631
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:39,859
And for the letter too.

632
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,459
I'm sure everything looks good on you.

633
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,459
Even rubber shoes.

634
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:48,389
And the tie.

635
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,259
Probably.

636
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,959
So?

637
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,135
Will you go on the blind date?

638
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,259
I may.

639
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:02,959
Ki Taek said...

640
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:05,859
you're supposed to live for love.

641
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:08,859
So I should, right?

642
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,659
You said you'd just focus
on learning the job.

643
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:13,889
How fickle.

644
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:18,619
I'm saying I should work well, love well,

645
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,189
and do everything well.

646
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:22,119
I heard...

647
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,219
you make gimbap well, too.

648
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:25,789
Who said that?

649
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,489
Ki Taek said that earlier.

650
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:30,559
Well, I'm not bad.

651
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:33,529
If you have nothing else to do tomorrow,

652
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,359
why don't you make some?

653
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:40,219
That's not difficult, so
I'll do it if you want.

654
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:43,259
I owe you a lot anyway.

655
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,919
Kang Ho. You should go home.

656
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:58,189
Okay.

657
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,118
Aren't you going home?

658
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,029
No. I still have work to do.
You can go first.

659
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:05,989
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,419
How are things lately?

661
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,789
Are you getting used to
living independently?

662
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:12,689
Yes, of course.

663
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,919
It's great.

664
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,959
I'm glad. Go home.

665
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:19,859
Okay.

666
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,189
- Ms. Cho.
- Yes?

667
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:33,819
Here.

668
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:36,689
What's this?

669
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:38,889
I wanted...

670
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,859
to thank you for buying dinner
at the hotel and stuff,

671
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,459
so I wanted to give you something.

672
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,029
This is awkward.

673
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:51,459
It isn't expensive. I just
saw it while walking by...

674
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,319
and thought it was pretty.

675
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,159
See you tomorrow.

676
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,859
See you on Monday.

677
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,689
(Jang Kang Ho)

678
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,619
You're making gimbap often.

679
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,459
What is it today?

680
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,989
It's the weekend, so a date?

681
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,259
- It's not a date.
- It is.

682
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:21,919
It is not.

683
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,489
You're so transparent.

684
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,419
You don't have a poker face.

685
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:31,528
It really isn't a date.

686
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,659
Fine. Let's say it's a fake date.

687
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:36,359
If it is a date,

688
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,189
will you do something for me?

689
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:42,159
It's your date. Why should
I do something for you?

690
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:45,689
Half of these gimbap are yours.

691
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,259
- Really?
- Yes. Deal?

692
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:49,819
What do you want?

693
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,689
Well...

694
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:54,788
Remember that thing you
bought but won't wear...

695
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,418
because you don't like the color?

696
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,419
Can I borrow it?

697
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:01,119
It isn't a date,

698
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:05,089
but I need to wear something pretty today.

699
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:07,489
Please?

700
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:18,919
No wonder word got out.

701
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:20,589
Sorry?

702
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:21,789
It tastes good.

703
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,489
Mr. Seo, do you like gimbap?

704
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,529
I can make kimchi stew...

705
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:32,489
and beanpaste stew,

706
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:36,389
but I can't roll gimbap well.
Home-made gimbap tastes the best.

707
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,389
I like kimchi stew.

708
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,489
Then let's exchange.

709
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,619
I'll make kimchi stew. You make gimbap.

710
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:45,889
Exchange?

711
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:10,759
But...

712
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,959
what if people from the office see?

713
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:15,559
Since we came alone...

714
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:18,219
What if they see?

715
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,059
Is that bad?

716
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,059
No, it's not that it's bad.

717
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,059
- Still...
- Gosh.

718
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:25,559
You're so inconsistent.

719
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,688
Pardon? What did I do?

720
00:44:27,689 --> 00:44:30,018
You say whatever you feel
like without a filter.

721
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:31,958
So why do you care what people will think?

722
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:34,419
That's not what I meant.

723
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,959
To be honest, you're the one
who cared what others thought.

724
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:41,359
You wouldn't even let me greet
you in the neighborhood.

725
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:44,409
You said to keep it a secret that
we lived in the same neighborhood.

726
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,858
That was because I didn't want
employees talking about us.

727
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,319
I was being considerate.

728
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,259
I didn't care at all.

729
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,889
Then now, you don't care
if people talk about you?

730
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:58,519
Well,

731
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:00,459
probably not.

732
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:30,959
Hang on tightly, or you'll fall.

733
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,689
Okay.

734
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:38,589
That's it.

735
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,819
That way, you won't fall.

736
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:03,989
Sang Man!

737
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,219
Sit down.

738
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:14,258
Why are you by the office on a weekend?

739
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:15,659
And why did you want to see me?

740
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,959
The spa by our office is the best.

741
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,089
It's not my office anymore.

742
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:23,758
Still, you came all the
way here to use the spa?

743
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:24,959
Seriously.

744
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,419
I bought a monthly pass.

745
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,389
If I come during the week...

746
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:32,889
and run into the kids, I'd look pathetic.

747
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:39,659
If you know you look pathetic... Gosh.

748
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,519
How are things at the company?

749
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,589
That chief director punk...

750
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:49,889
started reorganization.

751
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,689
Execution day will be here soon.

752
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:59,459
Goodness.

753
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:04,319
What about you? Do you like staying home?
Are you okay?

754
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,059
My wife took away all my credit cards.

755
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,439
She treated me like a human
being when I made money,

756
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:16,418
but now that I don't,

757
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:19,358
I get no respect either at home or outside.

758
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,559
That's how it is.

759
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,119
You're a problem too.

760
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:25,589
Are you thoughtless or bold?

761
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:27,588
How could you eat all three meals at home?

762
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:28,749
That's why you get cursed at.

763
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:34,358
That's why I thought of
a new business plan.

Hello, Park!

765
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,258
- Hi.
- Here are your beer and snacks.

766
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:41,359
When did you order this? So?

767
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:43,129
What about a convenience store like this?

768
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,459
You want to open a convenience store?

769
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,219
I think...

770
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:48,688
it's better than chicken.

771
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:50,618
The store by the office does well.

772
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:51,858
- What?
- It does.

773
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:54,858
No. That's ancient history.

774
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:57,819
It isn't profitable anymore.

775
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:02,088
Also, part-timers quit easily, but
it's not like I do without them.

776
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:05,318
Furthermore, I work until
dawn, so I'm always sick.

777
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:08,358
And at night? It's really scary here.

778
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,219
This isn't something that people should do.

780

Let me ask you something.

781
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:19,558
Why do you do it then?

782
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:20,619
Excuse me?

00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:24,059
- Sang Man.
- What?

Let's do this.

785
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:30,419
Well, it's better than chicken.

786
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,489

The weather's very nice.

794

I have something to give you.

Well... It's...

this.

798
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:31,059

Right?

at a very famous place.

Can you keep it?

It's a talisman that will help
you become a CEO in one try.

It seems like you don't know this, but...

try, you can end up losing it all.

end up retiring quickly too.

If not, it will go to waste.

done, you can definitely do it.

Of course, you have to think
about your brother back home...

and think a little bit more carefully.

00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:36,789
Mr. Seo.

822
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,779
You're saying this because of the
issue with the contest, right?

823
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:45,119
I know that this world is
filled with unjust things.

824
00:51:46,259 --> 00:51:47,419
However,

825
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:51,059
it's not something that you
can change by yourself.

826
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,559
Then do you want to help me?

827
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,619
I can't help you either.

828
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:01,459
However, let's think about it together.

829
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:05,359
Alone, you're weak, but
together, we can be strong.

830
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:08,659
Instead of thinking, "As
long as I do well,"

831
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:12,359
if we contemplate it together,
it will get better...

832
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:14,819
little by little.

833
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:19,019
Yes, sir.

834
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,689
I threw...

835
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:24,219
too many tantrums, didn't I?

836
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:27,658
I'll really try my best from now on.

837
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,089
I might end up a CEO before you.
Be on your toes.

838
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,789
All right. Let's try working under CEO Eun.

839
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:10,359
What happened? Do you know
how many times I called you?

840
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:11,859
Why didn't you pick up?

841
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:15,059
Why didn't you come? What's wrong?

842
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:19,659
Ki Taek.

843
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:22,519
Is something wrong?

844
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:32,159
What is wrong? Tell me.

845
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,819
My friend is really sick.

846
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,369
I've know him since I was a kid.

847
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:44,959
Actually, since I was born,

848
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,959
and he's very sick.

849
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:52,119
Which friend? Is he someone I know?

850
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:55,419
You don't know him.

851
00:53:56,759 --> 00:54:00,019
How sick is he?

852
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:02,019
A lot.

853
00:54:03,419 --> 00:54:04,659
He's very sick.

854
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,589
He might die.

855
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:18,189
Poor him.

856
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:27,959
I'm so sorry, Ji Na. I'm so sorry.

857
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:32,859
I understand.

858
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:36,988
He's one of your closest friends.
No wonder you couldn't come.

859
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:38,258
I'm sorry.

860
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,459
You still should have picked up the phone.
I was worried about you.

861
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,219
Here.

862
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,919
We don't need to go far. I
feel like I'm on a vacation.

863
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,619
Good.

864
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:06,559
You were probably worried all day.
Eat a lot.

865
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:08,159
Even though I didn't make it.

866
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:11,019
Your face became hollow in one day.

867
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,958
Hurry up and eat.

868
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:18,488
You should've eaten something
even though I didn't come.

869
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:20,089
What did you do all day?

870
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:23,118
I just needed to wait a little
bit, and I could eat with you.

871
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,389
Why would I eat alone?

872
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:26,889
Let's eat.

873
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:36,019
Eat some anchovies too. Here.

874
00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:41,089
- You should eat too.
- It's okay.

875
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:43,619
My mom sent me this.

876
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:46,489
You too.

877
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,689
Let's eat.

878
00:55:58,019 --> 00:55:59,419
Eat slowly.

879
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:05,489
All right.

880
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:08,089
I was so hungry.

881
00:56:09,459 --> 00:56:12,359
My gosh. This is delicious.

882
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,259
It is delicious.

883
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:31,959
Don't worry.

884
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:45,619
Did you have a good weekend?

885
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:48,859
We won't be seeing each
other for much longer now.

886
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:52,189
Whom are you talking to?

887
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,819
Good morning, my comrade, Jang Kang Ho.

888
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,258
You must have some good news.

889
00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:00,559
Good news? Yes, I do.

890
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:03,418
All the people I love are here,

891
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,259
and if I go to work, I can see all of them.

892
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,118
What's better news than that?

893
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,765
You said you were going to go on a
trip with Ms. Ha over the weekend.

894
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:11,019
It must've been a lot of fun.

895
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,389
Yes, it was very fun.

896
00:57:15,419 --> 00:57:17,619
We went on a very long trip.

897
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:20,089
Hello.

898
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:23,559
It seems like Ho Won is
the one with good news.

899
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:26,079
Your face is lit up. What did
you do over the weekend?

900
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:27,489
Me?

901
00:57:28,419 --> 00:57:31,759
I did my laundry, cleaned
my house, and cooked.

902
00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:35,518
What about you? Did you go home?

903
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,688
Yes, I made up with my dad and
had a drink with him too.

904
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,459
So you gained acknowledgement from him?

905
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:43,418
Did you forget what Mr. Seo said?

906
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,959
My worth is determined by myself.

907
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:48,119
He did say that.

908
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:51,888
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

909
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,358
Go in first. I want to stop
by the convenience store.

910
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,519
- Do you?
- We'll go first.

911
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:57,659
Let's go.

912
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,619
- I want to eat gimbap.
- What?

913
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:02,959
- Gimbap?
- Yes.

914
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,089
Let's eat it later.

915
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:17,689
Mr. Seo. You look great in that tie.

916
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:19,789
Do you have an important business today?

917
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:22,788
I can tell you're more
dressed up than usual.

918
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:23,819
Is that so?

919
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:25,459
Someone gave me this as a gift.

920
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,689
I guess that person has a good taste.

921
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,188
I'm sure you've had
trouble with your work...

922
00:58:33,189 --> 00:58:35,888
because of our team's budget.

923
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:38,589
Aren't we going to have
additional promotion of Hauliz?

924
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:40,759
Not for a while, Ms. Ha.

925
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:43,619
Ho Won and Ki Taek,

926
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:46,018
we've been having a subcontractor
do the online promotion.

927
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:47,358
You should do it yourselves.

928
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,458
You worked together on the catalog before,

929
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,289
and you made a good team.

930
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:52,689
Yes, sir.

931
00:58:58,259 --> 00:58:59,319
Yes, sir.

932
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:02,218
Ms. Ha.

933
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,259
You should come up with a
plan to raise Hauliz's sales.

934
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:07,159
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Heo.

935
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,618
Please ask the sales team for assistance...

936
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:11,289
and plan our sale overseas.

937
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:15,919
Yes, sir. Your plan is to use two
nickels if you don't have a dime.

938
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:18,619
Yes. Please hang in there.

939
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,089
I believe in your ability.

940
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,589
All right. I'll go and get the
chief director's authorization.

941
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,589
He's inside, right?

942
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:32,189
He's been waiting for you.

943
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:38,389
Yes. Come in.

944
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,819
I'm thinking about laying
off two people from...

945
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:47,689
the sales and marketing department.

946
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:50,689
Have you chosen the people to dismiss?

947
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,619
There is no one to dismiss in our team.

948
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:56,559
Mr. Seo.

949
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,159
You can't say that. What about our team?

950
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,590
We only have four employees
including myself.

951
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,340
This is like wringing out a dry towel.

952
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,420
We can't reduce personnel anymore.

953
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,160
Is that why you told the
employees about it?

954
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,420
How long...

955
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,420
do you think I will put
up with the way you work?

956
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,190
Have you been putting up with me?

957
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,020
You made the employees anxious
and the atmosphere unsettling.

958
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,789
What do you think you're doing?

959
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:27,990
I'm working.

960
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,790
Mr. Seo.

961
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,691
- What's wrong with you?
- Mr. Seo.

962
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:34,261
Are you joking with me right now?

963
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,621
You have a bad sense of humor,

964
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:38,361
so it's not fun to joke with you.

965
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:42,521
I came to get your authorization.

966
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:51,791
What is this?

967
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:55,591
Should I have written it in Korean?

968
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:57,361
Can't you read?

969
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:59,491
It's my letter of resignation.
