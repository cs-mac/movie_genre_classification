1
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,263
Time: Sengoku Era (~1493 - 1598),
a time when Japan was divided...

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,469
into many warring providences
each ruled by a feudal lord.

3
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:38,683
Location: Akaike, a small and
poor providence by the sea.

4
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,930
Other: Ming Dynasty/Ming,
refers to China...

5
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,522
which was ruled by the Ming at the time.

6
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,076
Shouan!

7
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:57,831
Don't worry.

8
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:00,625
If we've come this far,
we should be safe.

9
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,044
Listen up Kotarou,

10
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:03,725
You need to go on
alone from here on out.

11
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:04,296
What?

12
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:06,423
If something happens along the way,

13
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,091
Sell this for a sen.

14
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,897
What about you, Shouan! ?

15
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:13,013
I need to check if everyone
at the temple is safe.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,639
In Akeike,

17
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,725
Head for the Mangaku Temple in Shirato.

18
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,770
Monk Zekkai will help you.

19
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:19,479
But..!

20
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:20,772
Hurry up and go!

21
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:21,731
Hurry!

22
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,357
Once we pass this mountain,
you'll reach our providence.

23
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,571
The footing's bad, so from
here on out we'll go by foot.

24
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:28,507
How about this?

25
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,967
Got it!

26
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:31,606
It's finally time to shine!

27
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:32,503
Put me in too!

28
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:33,804
Hope you don't lose it all!

29
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:34,638
Idiot!

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,017
You've drank to much,
you're red as rooster.

31
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,651
Boss!

32
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:56,577
We've got some prey!

33
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:22,604
What's wro-

34
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:35,700
Release the arrows!

35
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,216
Doshi, Kamou, the crates!

36
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,399
Keep shooting! Keep shooting!

37
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:26,627
Against those numbers, Lord
Rarou alone is enough.

38
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:57,784
Die!

39
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,677
It hurts!

40
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,262
It hurts!

41
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,223
It hurts! It hurts!

42
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,185
It hurts! !

43
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,757
You bastard! ! ! !

44
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:09,774
Both crates are safe.

45
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:20,535
Is this the level of
swordsmen in this country?

46
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:32,923
Akaike Providence

47
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,203
Hey! !

48
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,331
You shitty dog, get out!

49
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,626
Shit! I'm gonna beat you to death!

50
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:11,295
Wait! ! ! ! !

51
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,033
Tobimaru,

52
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:22,618
We're eating well tonight!

53
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,542
Just wait a second.

54
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,097
After we eat, we're
leaving this village, okay?

55
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,849
...okay?

56
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,151
Whose there? !

57
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,447
Not anyone suspicious, don't worry.

58
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,781
Get out!

59
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,746
When you say 'get out',

60
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,207
Does that means this is your

61
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,668
home?

62
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,129
That's right! This is our home!

63
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:17,466
We've been here looong before you came!

64
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,136
Well then I'll rent myself this space.

65
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,266
Tobimaru, let's go!

66
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:33,732
Is that a fish I smell?

67
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:34,733
Tobimaru!

68
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,789
I'm chilled to the bone.

69
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:51,367
Give it an hour and it should calm down.

70
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,627
It sure is cold.

71
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,588
To think we'd be escorting these Ming.

72
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,050
Even I have my limits.

73
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:06,849
Letting strangers like that into the
castle, what could the lord be thinking?

74
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:10,478
The lord must have some plan.

75
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,647
Talking about strange,

76
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,149
They're building something
over at the Shishine Fortress.

77
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:16,901
Oh,

78
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,738
You mean that old fortress
in the mountains?

79
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,816
I hear they searched
the entire providence...

80
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,035
and decided on the Shishine grounds.

81
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,579
Probably something to
do with the foundation.

82
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:33,626
I heard they rounded up all the local
workers and started barking orders.

83
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:38,506
What are they doing
out in that old place?

84
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:43,511
There's no way we could know
how people from Ming think.

85
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:56,650
That's a nice smell.

86
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,402
It's our fish.

87
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:02,114
I'll let you know that I don't
have a single fish for you.

88
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:06,869
You haven't been living
here all that long, right?

89
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,331
That smoke's coming up is
the sign of an unused tree.

90
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,709
It hadn't been dried out.

91
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,377
You didn't need to do that!

92
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,839
Be careful, it's hot.

93
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,517
I'm eating it.

94
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:31,769
Do what you like!

95
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,812
I didn't say it to you.

96
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,149
I said it to the dog.

97
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:01,424
Oh Yes, I did see a young child run by.

98
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:02,842
Was he alone?

99
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:05,678
I think he had a dog was it?

100
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,056
When did you see him?

101
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,725
It might've been this morning...

102
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,519
Where?

103
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:17,357
I've been getting bad at
remembering things these days...

104
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:20,110
No matter what, you have to remember!

105
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,113
Even if you say that...

106
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,991
You remembered? !

107
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:38,170
Hmm...I didn't think there was
anyone living in that temple.

108
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:47,430
Tobimaru, run!

109
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,408
We are the lord's army.

110
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,455
Don't interfere!

111
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,958
Don't you think this is
a bit rough for a kid?

112
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:17,793
Move!

113
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,922
Bastard! !

114
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,966
Did you not hear what I said? !

115
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,051
Don't draw it.

116
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:26,927
Watch what you say!

117
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,453
Sorry, but I don't plan on getting
any further involved in this.

118
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,475
Tobimaru!

119
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,025
Tobimaru!

120
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,485
Tobimaru.

121
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,448
Seems like poison.

122
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,744
It's not something an amateur can cure.

123
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,456
Though if you take him to a doctor,

124
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,137
Where's a doctor?

125
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,500
Ask in the village.

126
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,378
If I go back I'll be captured.

127
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,591
Then you'll have to ride a
horse to the next village.

128
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,668
I can't ride a horse.

129
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:30,763
Well then good luck on nursing him.

130
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,641
I guess the dead won't be needing this.

131
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,302
You plan on leaving? !

132
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,688
You think I could live long
in a violent place like this?

133
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,775
It's your fault!

134
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,736
Tobimaru's dying because of you!

135
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,522
He saved your life and you're
going to leave him! ! ?

136
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:49,656
Have you no shame!

137
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,950
And I'm the one who saved you!

138
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,327
We're even.

139
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,712
If you plan on living alone,

140
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,924
Then don't depend on others.

141
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,682
Wait!

142
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,480
A...a deal!

143
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,432
If you save Tobimaru,

144
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:26,361
And take us to the Mangaku Temple
in Shirato, I'll give you this!

145
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,488
It's worth ten ryo! It's a gem.

146
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,835
Ten ryo?

147
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,283
That's right, it's a gem.

148
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,338
Well it doesn't look cheap.

149
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,798
Of course!

150
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,968
I've never told a lie!

151
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,679
You can't come any closer.

152
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,849
It'd be trouble if you
ran when I gave it to you.

153
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,017
If you take us, I'll give it to you.

154
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,103
What will you do?

155
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:00,938
Shirato, eh?

156
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,537
It is a bit far...

157
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,359
You don't want this gem?

158
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,447
Well it is a gem...

159
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,450
Don't you want it! ?

160
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,412
Don't you want it! ?

161
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,414
Don't you want it? !

162
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,633
Is Tobimaru okay?

163
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,095
Is the town far?

164
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,476
Answer me! I'm the one who hired you!

165
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,188
The dog's in pain, but
he's still breathing.

166
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,940
It'll still be a while until the town.

167
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,484
Hurry up!

168
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:47,985
The horse is exhausted.

169
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:53,200
Plus even if there's a doctor, we
don't know if he'll look at a dog.

170
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,079
Hey,

171
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,539
Why are you being chased?

172
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,501
If I'm working for you, you
should be able to tell me.

173
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,879
If Tobimaru dies, it's your fault!

174
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:07,623
I won't give you the treasure!

175
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,049
I'll never forgive you!

176
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,926
I'll curse you until I'm dead!

177
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,554
What a boss.

178
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,450
He says to hire more workers
and hurry the construction.

179
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,035
Understood.

180
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:41,347
First they give gold for
the land and workers,

181
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,877
and now a hundred ryo
for more workers...

182
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:48,381
None of it seems to make any sense.

183
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:52,719
I'm sure they have a reason to hurry,
but even if we ask they won't tell us.

184
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:58,975
It's probably got something to
do with the kid they're chasing.

185
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:04,313
Still, the more they keep it a
secret the more I want to know.

186
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:05,648
Indeed.

187
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:10,820
But when they're vessels of the Ming
Dynasty, it's tough to lay a hand.

188
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,122
The horse needs to rest,
so you bring him over.

189
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:24,250
You should've just
bought a Samurai horse.

190
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,961
I just bought the best one.

191
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:28,880
You bring him over!

192
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,716
Don't forget the saddle.

193
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,510
If you take to long you'll get lost.

194
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,264
Shit!

195
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,939
I've done what I can, but...

196
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:49,526
I've never worked on an animal before.

197
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,868
Tobimaru!

198
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,084
Will he be okay?

199
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,919
The wound isn't bad,

200
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,921
But the poison got into his body.

201
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:12,466
Anyhow, the doctor said to make sure
he drinks water and doesn't move.

202
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:13,467
Water?

203
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,594
It'll drive away the poison.

204
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:21,308
Shit!

205
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:23,727
It's not going to work
while he's paralysed.

206
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,646
Put Tobimaru down.

207
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,107
I said put him down!

208
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,267
Did anyone see anything?

209
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:06,195
Unfortunately, the villager
who led them here...

210
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:09,858
separated from the group
before they entered.

211
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:10,817
I see.

212
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,921
What do you mean by this?

213
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:48,481
Was there a festival tonight?

214
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:57,698
If you want, you can stay in the back.
It's empty so it should be comfortable.

215
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,026
Thanks.

216
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:03,704
Well I've got your
money, so I don't mind.

217
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:07,338
Oh yeah, there's an bath on
the cliff just a little...

218
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:10,377
walk from here. Take a
dip if you feel like it.

219
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,574
Looks like I overslept.

220
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,872
How's the little dog?

221
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,380
Where are you going! ?

222
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,799
I'm going to get a saddle in town.

223
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:59,094
Saying something like that, you
aren't planning on running are you?

224
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:03,056
If did that I'd have done
all this work for free.

225
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,590
Is that him? The blond haired monster?

226
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:40,136
Yeah, I hear he's a guest and has been
going in and out of the lord's castle.

227
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,465
And I hear his eyes are blue!

228
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:44,974
Is that true?

229
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:46,017
Yeah.

230
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,359
I hear that blue eyed
guy has a lot of gold,

231
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:59,073
Better not get too close
though, or he'll eat you!

232
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:00,783
Ain't that right.

233
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,826
Is this good?

234
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,914
That's a saddle from Ooatari...

235
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,709
I brought a bunch when I moved here.

236
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,545
Who'd want to stay in
that ruined providence.

237
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:14,922
Yeah...

238
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:17,049
Don't let it bother you.

239
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:25,307
Kingai and Doshi haven't returned
from the search yesterday.

240
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,684
They probably found a lead.

241
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:30,896
I doubt anything could have
happened to those two.

242
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,803
Still, I never would
have thought finding...

243
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:44,743
a child would take so much effort.

244
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:48,081
Indeed, we only have four days left.

245
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:50,917
Eventually he'll come
to the temple, but...

246
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:55,088
If we miss this full moon, we'll have
to spend another year in this country.

247
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:58,550
I'm tired of this country already.

248
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:03,555
But since it's for the
senyaku, it can't be helped.

249
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,557
Senyaku?

250
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:09,102
It seems like one big joke to me.

251
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,398
Do you not use our drug because
you don't believe in senyaku?

252
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,191
That's not the problem.

253
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:19,028
The drugs you guys take at least work.

254
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:21,197
But senyaku...

255
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:24,200
That's something that
even I cannot know.

256
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:29,456
Wait, then why don't you use our drug?

257
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,000
Because it's boring.

258
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:50,352
What's wrong?

259
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,648
I feel...like having a little fun.

260
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,397
Why don't you draw?

261
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,443
Is your blade a fake?

262
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,461
Lord Rarou!

263
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:41,132
What is it?

264
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,301
Kingai and Doshi have been killed!

265
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:50,308
...and it was just getting fun.

266
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,470
You sure are late.

267
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:27,471
Really?

268
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:31,183
Sure you weren't looking to sell me out?

269
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:34,103
Who'd buy a twisted kid like you?

270
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:35,604
Don't play dumb!

271
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:40,484
You were trying to find out why
I'm being chased, weren't you?

272
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:43,529
I bet you were asking all around town!

273
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:45,864
Brat, shut up already.

274
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,325
I'm not 'brat', I'm Kotarou!

275
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,119
What are you hiding from me? !

276
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:54,081
Finding someone to sell me
a saddle took some time.

277
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,334
That sounds like a big lie!

278
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,128
What do I have to say
to make you believe me?

279
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:01,588
Who trusts a man who works for money? !

280
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:04,341
I hope you fall on your money!

281
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:07,678
If you're going to go that far,

282
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:09,597
Then should we part ways here?

283
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:13,143
If you do that, you'll have done
all this work for free, right?

284
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:23,111
Tobimaru!

285
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,279
Tobimaru!

286
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,278
Don't rush,

287
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:32,954
Drink nice and slow.

288
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,211
The doctor gave me this.

289
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,882
'when he gets to the point where he
can drink water, he should drink this'

290
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:47,010
He said it tastes real bad so
he'll probably give a fight.

291
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,805
I'll make dinner.

292
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:59,564
Wait, I'll help you drink it.

293
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:15,331
The clothes and sword are
Doshi's, but it's someone else.

294
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:19,085
Doshi had an old scar on his
right arm down to the bone.

295
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:23,005
There was no scar on the burned corpse?

296
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,550
There were also several
other things off.

297
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,664
Going by the corpse
conditions, the first to die...

298
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:32,181
were Kingai and two soldiers
of this providence.

299
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:35,351
Kingai died by having his entire
neck shattered with a single blow.

300
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,603
It must have been someone skilled.

301
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,232
Looking at the wounds on the rest of
the corpses, it seems Doshi killed them.

302
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,692
Kingai's hair was cut, but...

303
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:46,946
I believe Doshi was the one who did it.

304
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:51,367
Are you saying Doshi was attacked
by the soldiers of this providence?

305
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:52,660
Likely.

306
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,905
Then Doshi....

307
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:59,459
Since they made it seem like he died,
it means he's likely alive somewhere.

308
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:04,423
It's become troublesome, hasn't it?

309
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:29,990
I'm sorry.

310
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:33,910
I'm sorry...for before.

311
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,872
I...lost my temper.

312
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,751
We both did.

313
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:42,753
Don't worry about it.

314
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:49,594
I'm a little impatient,

315
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:52,138
From now on don't make me wait too long.

316
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:29,801
That's...?

317
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,512
It sounds like it's
from the west wing...

318
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:37,475
I heard the guests were trying out
a gift that was brought for them.

319
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:39,186
A terrible sound...

320
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:41,980
I sense an ill-omen.

321
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:53,867
What kind of charm is that?

322
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,204
It makes it so you can't
draw the sword, right?

323
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:03,077
It's like a prayer type thing.

324
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:04,745
What kind of prayer?

325
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,630
It's a secret to others.

326
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:09,633
Hmph, getting me all interested.

327
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:17,141
Good, good.

328
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:19,935
You're really nice to horses.

329
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:25,733
What benefit is there to
having a horse in a good mood?

330
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,276
There's lots.

331
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,947
Like making him quiet so you
can sneak up and rob people?

332
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,950
If you learn to ride a
horse you'll understand.

333
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,327
If you ride a horse, you feel good.

334
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:39,748
When you're on a horse
running at full speed,

335
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,750
How do I say it...

336
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:42,834
Yeah,

337
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,253
It's like you're flying in the skies.

338
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:46,921
The sky?

339
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,549
That ain't a bad feeling.

340
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:54,304
You feel a nice wind in your chest.

341
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:55,764
And that's when you feel,

342
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,392
Just a bit more free than you are now.

343
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:03,772
Really?

344
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:12,655
Does it really feel nice like
you're flying in the sky?

345
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:21,456
Whether or not it does, that's something
for you to find out for yourself.

346
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:43,896
Owww.

347
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:45,994
It's because you're swaying.

348
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:49,568
It's not my fault. It's
because this horse is rough!

349
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,903
How's he rough?

350
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,730
He's extremely calm.

351
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,616
Look, he's been neutered.

352
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:59,203
It's to make him calm.

353
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:01,997
What do you want to do? Quit already?

354
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:28,984
It didn't seem like they suspected us.

355
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:30,623
Don't let your guard down.

356
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,147
You've always been too cautious.

357
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:34,281
What results do you have?

358
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:37,075
I've never seen a man
with endurance like this.

359
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,162
No matter how many times he's
burned he doesn't bat an eyebrow.

360
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,207
Let me see.

361
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,970
Oh! This is unbelievable!

362
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:59,389
What do you think, Shougen?

363
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:02,309
Even if we speak different
words, we're both human.

364
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:07,899
To not feel pain. Even before
my eyes it seems unbelievable.

365
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:11,944
Lord! Please leave the
interrogation to me.

366
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,614
Yes, you are a dependable man.

367
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:17,366
Itadori Shougen, I'm leaving it to you.

368
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:22,413
Interrogate this Ming and make
some sort of deal with him.

369
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,670
Oh Mr. Samurai, you sure are up early.

370
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,809
You as well.

371
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:34,842
I was thinking about going down to town.

372
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:38,921
I've got these crops I'm
hoping to sell for a...

373
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:43,059
fortune and then enjoy a
drink or two down there.

374
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:05,207
Smells like cow shit!

375
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:07,251
It's from the berries.

376
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:10,254
If it cooks a little longer
the smell will go away.

377
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,841
Are you trying to kill me so
you can steal the treasure?

378
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:16,593
Seriously...

379
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,388
A bad boss sure makes you work.

380
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,967
I'll give you twenty mon for all of it.

381
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,177
How about just a little bit more?

382
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,770
No, no.

383
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:29,940
If you don't like it, you
can try somewhere else.

384
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:42,161
What's it say?

385
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:46,165
The lord is looking
for a kid with a dog.

386
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:50,169
There's a huge reward to
the one who finds him.

387
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,714
A kid with a dog, eh?

388
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:55,425
There are thousands
of those around here,

389
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,635
Don't waste your time on this!

390
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:04,058
Hey,

391
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:09,022
These strangers think they can
just waltz around the castle.

392
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,277
I...I've lost.

393
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,739
You're still too weak to draw a bow.

394
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:18,774
Next!

395
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:19,949
Yes!

396
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:46,894
Sorry about that, my hand
slipped from the sweat.

397
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:50,439
How about it? Watching
must be a bore for you,

398
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:52,483
Up for a match?

399
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,813
Oh yeah...

400
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:59,115
You don't understand
what I'm saying, eh?

401
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:01,617
Well I guess we're in trouble here.

402
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,185
Throw me a wooden sword!

403
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,577
Excuse me,

404
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,416
I guess they're...out?

405
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,350
Thanks for the room.

406
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,380
What's it say?

407
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:02,637
If you're going to live alone, you
better learn to read and write.

408
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:04,306
Your back's slumping.

409
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:07,350
I didn't tell you to get all rigid.

410
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,478
You don't need to bug
me about everything!

411
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:13,148
If I don't tell you you're
awful, you'll never get good.

412
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,109
If you just tell me what I'm
doing right, I'll get even better!

413
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:21,615
The weather's so nice.

414
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,910
To think that someone
actually injured you,

415
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:27,162
Who was it you fought?

416
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:29,665
A man from the Ming Dynasty.

417
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,086
He had blue eyes, and
was over six feet tall!

418
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,797
Wow, like a real demon.

419
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:37,924
He might be scarier than a demon.

420
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:41,302
He's the second person I've ever
seen with that level of skill.

421
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,804
The second?

422
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,806
An old acquaintance of mine.

423
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:48,851
When I served the Ooatari Providence.

424
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:52,271
We fought side by side in the wars,

425
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:56,609
But after a certain
battle, he disappeared.

426
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:59,375
Seems he'd gotten sick of war.

427
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,864
Then he was a kind man, right?

428
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,700
He was just weak hearted.

429
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:09,831
He's a man that threw away
the god's gift that he had.

430
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:14,877
So then how will you
use your gifted skills?

431
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:19,758
That's easy. I'll use it to get even
more strength and climb even higher.

432
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,470
You sound almost as if you're
going to conquer the country.

433
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,976
I've got no intention of an
aspiration within a set height.

434
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:34,523
Me, I'll set my height at
the peak of my aspiration!

435
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:48,245
That's a lot of scars!

436
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:51,582
They're what I got for going to war.

437
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:54,042
What providence did you serve?

438
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,462
It's not worth naming,

439
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:59,590
It was destroyed and
doesn't exist anymore.

440
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:01,967
You don't volunteer anymore?

441
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:05,471
Yeah...

442
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,014
I got sick of it.

443
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,563
Oh yeah, I still haven't
asked you your name?

444
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:17,901
As a samurai you must have
some really fancy name, right?

445
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:20,236
Akage

446
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,031
Yeah, that's a cool one.

447
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:24,941
[Nanashi = Nameless]

448
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,326
Akaomi Nanashi

449
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:29,287
What! ? Don't tease me!

450
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,751
I'm not teasing you.

451
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:37,796
It's Nanashi because I've got no name.

452
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:42,092
I've had quite a few names, having to
change it along with the providence.

453
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,148
Grab that bamboo shute.

454
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,923
By dying it with berries,

455
00:43:21,257 --> 00:43:23,259
It should last another ten days.

456
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,387
You're a...foreigner?

457
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:29,181
Who knows? Even I don't.

458
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,935
I hear I was picked up
from a foreign ship,

459
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,104
But I was the only one left alive.

460
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,066
There were those that hated me,

461
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:41,986
But since I learned this method,
those problems went away.

462
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:46,615
The life I have now is far better
than the one I had as a general.

463
00:43:58,462 --> 00:43:59,629
What's wrong?

464
00:43:59,796 --> 00:44:02,174
If you stand there you'll catch a cold.

465
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,516
You sure are quiet suddenly.

466
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,977
Did my hair color scare you?

467
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:15,729
I'm not scared at all!

468
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:18,190
I've seen hundreds of foreigners before!

469
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,151
It's just...I was surprised.

470
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,113
You feeling good little dog?

471
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:28,075
Pursuers.

472
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:31,536
Pretend you haven't noticed and
start talking about something.

473
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:33,676
What?

474
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:37,209
Still, I'm surprised you've
seen so many foreigners.

475
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:39,377
Where did you see them?

476
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,171
Tell me.

477
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,426
In the Ming Dynasty,

478
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:49,430
Until two years ago,
that's where I lived.

479
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:51,390
Were you living by yourself?

480
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:54,143
I was with my little
brother and Tobimaru.

481
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,645
And your mother?

482
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:59,607
I hear she died soon after I was born.

483
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:00,983
Your dad?

484
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:05,071
When I was six...he left.

485
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,616
With no parents, how'd you come here?

486
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,953
One day, when I was about to be sold,

487
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:15,206
A monk, who came to Ming
to train, saved me.

488
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,544
And then he let me ride on
the bought back here with him.

489
00:45:19,836 --> 00:45:23,172
After reaching here I
lived at his temple.

490
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:25,967
Why'd you leave the temple?

491
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:28,928
The temple...

492
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,055
was attacked.

493
00:45:40,523 --> 00:45:42,526
Let go! I said let go!

494
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:43,894
From Akaike?

495
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:46,738
No, no, no, no that's not it!

496
00:45:46,864 --> 00:45:50,534
We're just thieves passing by!

497
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,453
Just thieves!

498
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,580
Tobimaru, let him go.

499
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:57,721
Please forgive me!

500
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,877
Please forgive me! !

501
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,712
Hurry up and get lost.

502
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:04,298
Th...Thank you!

503
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,971
Well then...

504
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,473
Wait a second.

505
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:16,560
Leave all your money.

506
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:20,564
Money? No we don't even have a sen!

507
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:22,232
Come on,

508
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,111
Please believe me! If we had
money, we wouldn't be thieving!

509
00:46:28,697 --> 00:46:29,948
A nice sound.

510
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,546
Silly thieves.

511
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,256
Even silly people are good sometimes!

512
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:48,426
I was planning on speeding up a bit,

513
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,220
Is the dog ok?

514
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:53,598
Yeah. If anythings wrong, I'll tell you.

515
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:57,227
Hang on tight so you don't fall!

516
00:46:57,393 --> 00:46:58,311
Ok!

517
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:24,337
Your right. It really
feels like we're flying.

518
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,048
It's not bad at all!

519
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:36,475
It's taken many years...

520
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:39,812
To get Byakuran before us,

521
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:43,023
When the source of
immortality is in his hands,

522
00:47:43,732 --> 00:47:47,611
The Emperor will be most pleased.

523
00:47:49,155 --> 00:47:52,575
Geshin and Suishin are heading to
the temple tonight as planned.

524
00:47:52,908 --> 00:47:56,454
Kachuu will be in charge of the
ritual at the alter tomorrow.

525
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:59,210
Everyone else, either work
on finding the child,

526
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,500
or the preparations for
escaping this castle.

527
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,753
The alter finished in time,

528
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:06,539
But the rest of the plan
has been a complete mess.

529
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,550
I really could not face
the Emperor like this.

530
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:12,231
I think it's about time
to start thinking...

531
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:14,263
about if we do not have the child.

532
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:19,770
If the full moon in two days passes,
the next won't be for another year.

533
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:23,015
In that time it's possible
another war could break out,

534
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:26,902
And this providence could be destroyed
causing us to lose everything.

535
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:27,986
So then...

536
00:48:28,153 --> 00:48:31,281
If we delay the ceremony a
few days they'll never know.

537
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,494
You're saying to send a
false message to the Emperor?

538
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:38,330
I do not believe the blood will change.

539
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:40,165
Shut your mouth!

540
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,056
Or we find the child in Ming,

541
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:45,921
And create an Alter in Ming.

542
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:49,049
In Ming even if we have
to wait a year or two...

543
00:48:49,174 --> 00:48:50,801
That's enough!

544
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:59,267
I'll go work on preparations for
our escape from this providence.

545
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:10,279
That fool!

546
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:14,575
To speak of fooling the Emperor!

547
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:17,078
No matter how skilled he is,

548
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,664
A warrior is just a warrior!

549
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,002
There's no way to stop
you from handing him over?

550
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:29,215
For the sake of our religion,
we can't refuse them.

551
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:30,341
But...!

552
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:32,022
This would defy our Buddhist ideals-

553
00:49:32,122 --> 00:49:33,128
You fool!

554
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:36,047
Protecting our religion is our ideal!

555
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:38,466
Be happy you are still alive!

556
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:39,600
Wait!

557
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:41,060
Let go!

558
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,326
This voice...?

559
00:49:57,535 --> 00:49:59,662
It suddenly started two hours ago.

560
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,894
So in the end you didn't get the reward?

561
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:15,087
The Samurai thought I was lying to him.

562
00:50:15,187 --> 00:50:19,308
He was really really mad. I
thought I was going to die.

563
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,603
I told you, you gotta stay away
from deals that sound too good.

564
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,277
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow?

565
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,320
Huh?

566
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,615
Look how sunny it is,
what are you saying?

567
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:40,821
Look, even though the west sky is cloudy
I can see the sun shining all bright.

568
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:44,041
That's a symbol that it's gonna snow.

569
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,795
He's told us everything.

570
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:48,295
Drug! Hurry! The Drug!

571
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,220
This is?

572
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,764
The drug he had on him.

573
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,935
This is what he's like when
he can't depend on it?

574
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,353
Put him to rest.

575
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,568
Senyaku?

576
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,939
According to the warrior we captured,

577
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:19,077
They're searching for a drug
that makes one immortal.

578
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,372
Immortal?

579
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:38,275
It was foretold in a Ming prophecy.

580
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,349
That was the start of it?

581
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:42,725
Yes.

582
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:47,106
According to the warrior Doshi,
it allows you to live forever.

583
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:49,904
Once every hundred years
a child is foretold...

584
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,819
of, and that by taking
the child's blood,

585
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:54,655
You can create a drug
that makes you immortal.

586
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,116
The Emperor believes this,

587
00:51:57,324 --> 00:51:59,493
And ordered his men to find the child.

588
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:01,829
The pursuers crossed
the ocean to find him?

589
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:05,624
The alter at the fortress, a
mechanism to engrave the time,

590
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:10,671
This is all to gather the blood
according to the foretelling.

591
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,676
Once every hundred years?

592
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,805
Still...is immortality even possible?

593
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,932
Who cares!

594
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:28,105
What's important is that the child's
worth even more than a ship of gold.

595
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:29,732
What should we do now?

596
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,434
As if I need to tell you?

597
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:35,738
Find the child first, and make
the foreigners disappear.

598
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:40,285
But they're the only ones who
know what the child looks like...

599
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:44,456
And since yesterday they've been
snooping around the whole providence.

600
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:46,416
I've already taken a step.

601
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,782
Even if they can't speak our language,

602
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:51,213
I'll have them at
least crying in defeat.

603
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:53,924
No matter what they try to do,

604
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,468
This is our providence!

605
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,269
Are you sad because Rarou isn't around?

606
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,398
Almost like a wife whose
lost their husband.

607
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:12,150
Don't make fun of me!

608
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,938
The reason I look sad is because
I don't have my hawk at my side.

609
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:17,656
Good job trying to hide it.

610
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,789
If we fail tomorrow...another
year in this country?

611
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:30,335
Still upset over your clash
with Lord Byakuran yesterday?

612
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,421
That's nothing.

613
00:53:31,963 --> 00:53:36,634
What I'm thinking about is
the one who killed Kingai.

614
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:38,136
Really,

615
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:41,931
To care more about some tough
guy than the Emperor's orders...

616
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:43,724
It's just like you.

617
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,893
I'll follow the Emperor's orders.

618
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:50,731
Even if that means ending
up like Doshi or worse.

619
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:55,249
Right now the lord's army
is watching in wait,

620
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:57,530
I'll be leading them.

621
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,649
Make sure you keep up.

622
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:01,117
I'll be looking forward to it.

623
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:17,175
I wonder if that's the
princess playing...

624
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:22,388
Give up on those aspirations.

625
00:54:23,015 --> 00:54:27,186
It's best to set your
aspirations within your limits.

626
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:32,983
Wait up Lord Itadori!

627
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:13,357
Hey,

628
00:55:15,276 --> 00:55:17,862
You're a pretty skilled
swordsman, aren't you?

629
00:55:19,072 --> 00:55:20,377
What about it?

630
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:22,693
It would've been great if
you taught me, not just...

631
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:24,661
how to ride a horse,
but how to sword fight.

632
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:28,456
What'll you do if you learn how?

633
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:31,751
What will I do? That's obvious,
it'll come in handy in life.

634
00:55:32,293 --> 00:55:34,879
The power of a sword's dependable!

635
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:36,714
Depend on it...

636
00:55:38,007 --> 00:55:40,718
I thought like that when I was a kid.

637
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:42,470
You think different now?

638
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:03,741
You were really shook up.

639
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:06,369
You've been awake?

640
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,918
I can't sleep in this.

641
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,545
I agree with that.

642
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:19,133
Hey, you want me to teach you
a way to avoid bad dreams?

643
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:25,973
You've just gotta hold something you
love and thing about nice things.

644
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,103
That's what I've been
doing up until now.

645
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:50,331
Lord Byakuran,

646
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,585
Are you having trouble sleeping?

647
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,838
I was thinking about something.

648
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,300
Fuu,

649
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:04,930
If you could live forever,
what would you do?

650
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:06,515
Hmm...

651
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:10,552
My desire is simply to live strongly,
even if it's for a short life.

652
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:12,145
I can understand that.

653
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:15,013
I've lived for so many
years now. It wouldn't...

654
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:17,142
be strange for me to pass at any time.

655
00:57:17,242 --> 00:57:18,151
But,

656
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:24,157
Strangely, the longer I continue to live
the greater my desire to live becomes.

657
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:29,189
Even understanding that this
drug we search for by...

658
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:33,667
the Emperor's order is
not to be used for myself,

659
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:39,005
Somewhere deep down, I feel I'm
searching for my own benefit.

660
00:57:59,986 --> 00:58:03,114
To think Shirato's Mangaku
Temple was this amazing...

661
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:05,074
The promised good.

662
00:58:08,703 --> 00:58:10,163
By the way,

663
00:58:10,371 --> 00:58:13,416
At the time I was all into
it and said it was a jewel,

664
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:14,959
Actually...

665
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,390
That's what I figured.

666
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:16,919
Huh?

667
00:58:17,378 --> 00:58:19,672
It's the kind of thing you'd think of.

668
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:23,968
Well, I should be able to at
least get about five ryo, right?

669
00:58:24,177 --> 00:58:25,261
Well....

670
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,432
On....one ryo?

671
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,268
Well it's not bad for a memento, right?

672
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:34,228
I'm sure it's got its good points!

673
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:37,231
What a kid.

674
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:38,308
I'm not a kid, I'm...

675
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:39,567
Kotarou?

676
00:58:42,403 --> 00:58:43,321
Kotarou!

677
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:45,324
Shouan!

678
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:47,326
Shouan!

679
00:58:51,038 --> 00:58:53,290
Shouan, you're safe!

680
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:55,096
I was worried!

681
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:57,753
I'm glad you're ok as well.

682
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,254
I'm so happy,

683
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:03,008
I thought maybe if I came here,
I'd be able to meet you again.

684
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:04,551
I...

685
00:59:06,386 --> 00:59:09,723
Here, let me guide you
to monk Zekkai's room.

686
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:16,438
Nanashi!

687
00:59:17,189 --> 00:59:18,774
See ya, kid!

688
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:23,403
If you ever want a name, come
here and see me whenever!

689
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:26,532
I'll think of an amazing name for you!

690
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:27,969
Shouan?

691
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,641
It took you quite some time to get here.

692
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,269
Monk Zekkai?

693
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:40,775
That was a long wait...we finally meet.

694
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,675
Let me go!

695
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,705
Let me go! !

696
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,157
I said let me go!

697
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:58,209
You tricked me, you bastard!

698
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,502
I trusted you!

699
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:01,420
Shit!

700
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:08,594
Don't kill him.

701
01:01:08,761 --> 01:01:10,930
It'll be easier to
carry him if he's quiet.

702
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:12,098
Let's go.

703
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:16,018
They came. Get your swords ready.

704
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:17,436
Attack!

705
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:21,566
It's a trap.

706
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:40,794
Run for the castle, we need
to inform Lord Itadori!

707
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:42,254
Bastard! !

708
01:01:47,259 --> 01:01:48,260
So then,

709
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:50,220
Where do you want to go?

710
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:06,570
Hurry.

711
01:02:59,248 --> 01:03:00,208
Who are you! ?

712
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,723
Where'd they take the kid? ! !

713
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:03,640
Don't tell him!

714
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,587
Don't say any--

715
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:06,673
Answer me!

716
01:03:06,924 --> 01:03:08,300
Answer me!

717
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:09,426
Tonight...

718
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:14,181
Tonight...they plan on killing
him and taking his blood.

719
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,008
For what purpose?

720
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:16,863
I don't know.

721
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:17,739
Where?

722
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:18,393
I don't know.

723
01:03:18,602 --> 01:03:19,645
I just don't know!

724
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:22,681
They didn't trust us.

725
01:03:22,781 --> 01:03:26,026
If we didn't hand him over,
they were going to kill us.

726
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,404
You handed him over knowing
they were going to kill him? !

727
01:03:29,696 --> 01:03:31,990
I wanted to save him.

728
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,159
It was monk Zekkai who decided it,

729
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:35,653
Not me! !

730
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:38,080
In the end you abandoned him!

731
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:43,544
That's right...

732
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:45,671
It's just as you say...

733
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,341
Like you said, I abandoned that child.

734
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,470
Being threatened...and
wanting to save my own life...

735
01:03:54,012 --> 01:03:55,431
I abandoned that child.

736
01:03:56,014 --> 01:03:56,932
But,

737
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:59,352
If you had been in my place,

738
01:03:59,853 --> 01:04:01,938
You would've done the same as me! !

739
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:05,567
Am I wrong?

740
01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:08,216
Can you even imagine
betraying your superiors...

741
01:04:08,316 --> 01:04:10,405
and following through
with your own ideals? !

742
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:11,990
You can't!

743
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,032
Right! ?

744
01:04:15,326 --> 01:04:16,953
Could you do it?

745
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,593
You talk all superior,

746
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,083
But are you going to save that child? !

747
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:23,418
You won't.

748
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:26,267
You won't go to something that
you know is certain death!

749
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,422
You...

750
01:04:27,714 --> 01:04:29,007
In the end,

751
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:30,633
You're the same as me!

752
01:04:49,904 --> 01:04:51,864
For a chicken shit like you,

753
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,200
A monk's robe is a waste.

754
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:14,720
What color?

755
01:05:15,054 --> 01:05:16,305
It's yellow and red.

756
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:18,808
They got him in time!

757
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:21,268
Yellow means they have the child,

758
01:05:21,435 --> 01:05:22,353
What's red?

759
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,564
It means that this castle's
soldiers have betrayed us!

760
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:27,900
Hurry and call Rarou.

761
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:35,866
Please wait!

762
01:05:36,242 --> 01:05:37,159
Wait!

763
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,953
I said wait!

764
01:05:39,787 --> 01:05:40,913
What business do you have here?

765
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,416
I don't mind. Let him through.

766
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:47,295
So you've noticed what really going on,

767
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:51,508
So how will the deal go today?

768
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,584
Why'd you attack without my order?

769
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:28,954
The Lord's order was to get
the child as soon as possible.

770
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:31,631
I'm the one in command of this army!

771
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,192
Where's the child?

772
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,098
It seems he doesn't know.

773
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:40,933
I have a good guess where.

774
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:43,352
It's likely the Shishine Fortress.

775
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:45,813
What should we do with this monk?

776
01:06:46,147 --> 01:06:49,400
He's a traitor who conspired with
Ming. Send him to the other world.

777
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:50,151
Yes sir.

778
01:06:50,485 --> 01:06:51,360
That's...?

779
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:57,283
The monk's disciple. It seems he hung
himself while the other was unconscious.

780
01:06:58,117 --> 01:06:58,902
I see.

781
01:06:59,002 --> 01:07:00,787
For now, we're returning to the castle.

782
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:03,664
The rest of you wait
here for the next order.

783
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:05,500
A message!

784
01:07:08,336 --> 01:07:09,545
A message!

785
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:15,481
The lord...?

786
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:18,763
He was wide open with no guards!

787
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:21,299
What about Isogai and Fuchiome?

788
01:07:21,399 --> 01:07:23,017
Unfortunately they were...

789
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,397
You just sat and watched
the Lord be kidnapped?

790
01:07:27,523 --> 01:07:30,609
He said he'd kill me.
I couldn't do a thing!

791
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:32,945
Why didn't you give chase? !

792
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,947
The main horses were poisoned!

793
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:37,157
All that was left were the work horses!

794
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:40,119
We sent the Wataoki and Kawashi
armies towards the Fortress,

795
01:07:40,285 --> 01:07:43,831
But even if they rush, they
won't reach it before night!

796
01:07:44,373 --> 01:07:46,826
You sent the Wataoki and Kawashi armies?

797
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:47,584
Yes sir.

798
01:07:47,793 --> 01:07:51,004
You are the only commander
left Lord Itadori!

799
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,258
The princess said to
leave the command to you.

800
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:56,218
I came as fast as I could.

801
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,304
Jyuurouta,

802
01:07:59,638 --> 01:08:01,765
Get a horse and armor ready.

803
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:04,017
One for each of us.

804
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:05,185
Understood.

805
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:07,229
We're changing plans.

806
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:08,939
All of you, head for the castle.

807
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,650
Myself and Jyurota will head
for the Shishine Fortress.

808
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:29,085
While we buy time, Lord Byakuran
you cross over the sea.

809
01:08:29,377 --> 01:08:30,962
You sure gave us some trouble.

810
01:08:31,463 --> 01:08:33,590
Just a bit more patience.

811
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:36,759
After we complete this, we'll
say goodbye to this country.

812
01:08:37,844 --> 01:08:39,095
That's true.

813
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:41,014
We can finally go home.

814
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:49,731
It's yours, right?

815
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:53,318
The guy who chased us at
the Mangaku Temple had it.

816
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:55,487
What happened to him?

817
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:58,072
He should have been no
match for you, but...

818
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:02,202
I sent him to the other world with this.

819
01:09:13,631 --> 01:09:15,841
Just because your masters not around,

820
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:17,885
You better not bite me!

821
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:23,849
Afraid?

822
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:30,827
Pretending that you don't understand?
Or are you so afraid you can't speak?

823
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:32,566
Everyone eventually dies.

824
01:09:32,942 --> 01:09:38,043
There's no one with infinite
time in this world.

825
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:41,700
Even you'll live strongly in
the time that's left for you.

826
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:43,869
If you're going to kill
me, hurry up and do it!

827
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:48,165
Don't rush to your death, I
have something I must ask you.

828
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:53,921
When you were taken from the temple,
there was a man who tried to save you.

829
01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:55,464
A friend?

830
01:09:55,631 --> 01:09:56,799
No idea.

831
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,884
Answer honestly.

832
01:09:59,677 --> 01:10:01,804
I don't have any friends!

833
01:10:02,973 --> 01:10:06,184
It seems like I won't
get an answer from you.

834
01:10:06,643 --> 01:10:11,314
It doesn't matter...that man
was killed by my comrades.

835
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:27,164
Jyuurouta!

836
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:29,249
You know this area pretty well, right?

837
01:10:29,499 --> 01:10:32,419
There's a shortcut. But I don't
know if the horses can make it.

838
01:10:32,669 --> 01:10:34,463
I don't care if they break their legs,

839
01:10:34,588 --> 01:10:35,589
Hurry!

840
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:16,672
Can you see it?

841
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:21,231
When this hand points high,
your soul will leave your body,

842
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:25,473
And the blood in your body will
continue to live for the Emperor.

843
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:28,893
Think of it as an honor.

844
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,111
Are you worried?

845
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:39,570
No...

846
01:11:40,154 --> 01:11:41,356
Be not afraid,

847
01:11:41,456 --> 01:11:47,204
I hear Shougen is a great warrior,
with many comrades at his side.

848
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:50,374
I am sure he will save the lord.

849
01:11:55,587 --> 01:11:56,643
Can you do it?

850
01:11:56,743 --> 01:12:00,814
The Wataoki and Kawashi armies
are like brothers to me,

851
01:12:00,914 --> 01:12:02,803
You won't need to worry.

852
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:04,012
I'm counting on you!

853
01:12:04,138 --> 01:12:05,347
Leave it to me!

854
01:12:19,236 --> 01:12:20,320
It's Jyuurouta!

855
01:12:20,529 --> 01:12:23,031
Look! Lord Itadori has come too!

856
01:12:23,282 --> 01:12:24,616
Lord Itadori!

857
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,452
We've been waiting for you!

858
01:12:50,894 --> 01:12:52,604
What should we do?

859
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:55,607
Use the feudal lord as a
shield and buy us time.

860
01:12:56,232 --> 01:12:59,360
There's only two hours
left until the ritual.

861
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,848
Th...the lord?

862
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:17,212
What a disgrace.

863
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,964
Shougen!

864
01:13:20,423 --> 01:13:22,897
Is that you Shougen?

865
01:13:22,997 --> 01:13:24,385
How can we attack now?

866
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:27,764
What does Lord Itadori plan to do?

867
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:29,182
Jyuurouta.

868
01:13:40,361 --> 01:13:41,612
Shougen!

869
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,408
Don't panic!

870
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:50,955
It's time for you to ask your hearts!

871
01:13:51,122 --> 01:13:52,448
Will you follow me? !

872
01:13:52,548 --> 01:13:54,583
Or will you follow the dead lord? !

873
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:57,933
If you follow me, the
country is as good as ours!

874
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,755
Bastard!

875
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:04,844
I will follow Lord Itadori!

876
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,303
What will you do? !

877
01:14:06,512 --> 01:14:08,430
I'll follow Lord Itadori too!

878
01:14:08,556 --> 01:14:10,141
Me...me, too!

879
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,101
I'll follow Lord Itadori!

880
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,060
Me too!

881
01:14:13,269 --> 01:14:14,353
Me too!

882
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:17,773
We shall conquer this fortress!

883
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,777
What?

884
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:24,857
Unlike our Emperor,

885
01:14:24,957 --> 01:14:28,452
To them a lord is just a
descendant of a bloodline.

886
01:14:28,827 --> 01:14:31,288
Useless as a hostage it seems.

887
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:34,541
Damn barbarians!

888
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,252
I'm leaving the ritual up to Kachuu.

889
01:14:37,377 --> 01:14:39,379
Get down there and fight them off!

890
01:14:44,718 --> 01:14:45,886
Fire!

891
01:15:10,869 --> 01:15:11,411
Shit.

892
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:15,750
Damn.

893
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:44,403
Back!

894
01:15:45,738 --> 01:15:46,656
Forward!

895
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:53,830
Forward!

896
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:04,507
I'll be going first.

897
01:16:05,967 --> 01:16:07,147
Charge!

898
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:08,512
Lord Itadori!

899
01:16:08,637 --> 01:16:10,597
After we've taken their heads,

900
01:16:10,764 --> 01:16:12,808
I have a request!

901
01:16:13,016 --> 01:16:15,185
You can have the princess to yourself!

902
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:49,845
Got you!

903
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,359
Bitch!

904
01:17:06,196 --> 01:17:07,489
That's what you deserve!

905
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,170
Bows!

906
01:17:31,387 --> 01:17:32,806
Aim well!

907
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,242
Split into two groups!

908
01:17:40,342 --> 01:17:40,730
Yes!

909
01:18:19,854 --> 01:18:21,188
Don't back down!

910
01:19:04,065 --> 01:19:05,317
Now's the time!

911
01:19:05,484 --> 01:19:07,777
Rush in while they're distracted!

912
01:19:15,452 --> 01:19:16,620
Back down!

913
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:19,122
You guys go fight someone else.

914
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,000
This guy's my...

915
01:19:22,209 --> 01:19:23,293
Prey!

916
01:19:24,044 --> 01:19:25,086
I wouldn't try.

917
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,298
The spear is actually my true weapon.

918
01:19:28,548 --> 01:19:30,550
It won't go like before!

919
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:38,976
I'm enough of an
opponent for all of you!

920
01:20:22,228 --> 01:20:25,356
I can't say I don't understand
where you're coming from,

921
01:20:25,898 --> 01:20:27,441
But it's an uneeded emotion.

922
01:20:28,276 --> 01:20:30,154
This is the world we live in.

923
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:34,741
Our battle sounded the victory horn
for our lord to become the new ruler.

924
01:20:35,826 --> 01:20:38,620
This is all thanks to your hard work.

925
01:20:39,746 --> 01:20:40,706
In all honesty,

926
01:20:40,873 --> 01:20:42,875
I'm completely jealous.

927
01:21:13,655 --> 01:21:16,241
Hurry up and do it, you coward! ! !

928
01:22:31,902 --> 01:22:32,862
It's time.

929
01:22:39,827 --> 01:22:40,744
Tobimaru!

930
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:46,917
Kotarou! ! !

931
01:23:01,015 --> 01:23:02,975
That guy...

932
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:07,481
Move!

933
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:12,527
Move! ! !

934
01:23:32,464 --> 01:23:33,298
Tobimaru!

935
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,116
What's wrong? Come on!

936
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:43,369
I'm not feeling any pain!

937
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,999
Try to stab that sword through my heart!

938
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,085
Come on! !

939
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:57,342
Hurry up and get back
here! Kachuu's dead!

940
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,053
I've taken care of the rest of them!

941
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,232
Tobimaru!

942
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:19,865
Let's go!

943
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:24,716
The ritual's been
interrupted by someone!

944
01:25:24,816 --> 01:25:28,457
The time has passed.
What do you plan to do?

945
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,804
Isn't that obvious? !

946
01:25:29,904 --> 01:25:30,951
We'll take back the child,

947
01:25:31,051 --> 01:25:33,746
And we'll wait. Whether it's
ten or a hundred years!

948
01:25:33,846 --> 01:25:34,797
Leave it to me!

949
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:46,059
Seriously...

950
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:48,311
This isn't going to be cheap.

951
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:51,981
I knew it!

952
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:53,900
I heard you!

953
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:56,152
You called my name, right?

954
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,198
Damn it, you're late!

955
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:03,368
I told you I had a short patience!

956
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:05,328
Making me wait like that...

957
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:09,249
Alright, let's go. Don't fall behind.

958
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,576
I know.

959
01:26:11,676 --> 01:26:13,545
I didn't say it to you.

960
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:16,506
I said it to Tobimaru.

961
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:23,096
Get back!

962
01:26:53,627 --> 01:26:54,587
Nanashi!

963
01:27:22,823 --> 01:27:24,074
Where's my sword? !

964
01:27:26,745 --> 01:27:28,038
Where's my sword?

965
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:31,792
Nanashi!

966
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:42,928
Lord Rarou...

967
01:27:44,596 --> 01:27:45,555
My...sword...

968
01:27:45,889 --> 01:27:47,140
Lord....Ra...rou...

969
01:27:51,937 --> 01:27:54,397
To kill Fuu and Suishin,

970
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:56,099
An impressive man.

971
01:27:56,199 --> 01:27:57,150
Rarou!

972
01:27:57,859 --> 01:27:59,528
You're in the way. Move!

973
01:28:03,657 --> 01:28:04,491
Shit!

974
01:28:12,624 --> 01:28:13,959
This is the end for you!

975
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:26,722
You bastard!

976
01:28:26,889 --> 01:28:29,092
Have you gone crazy? ! !

977
01:28:29,192 --> 01:28:30,351
I am very sane.

978
01:28:30,476 --> 01:28:33,062
I am now glad I came to this country.

979
01:28:34,063 --> 01:28:37,024
I feel I've finally found an
opponent who will challenge me.

980
01:28:39,193 --> 01:28:42,321
I thank you for taking
me on this journey.

981
01:28:42,488 --> 01:28:43,656
You...!

982
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:45,950
Bastard warrior!

983
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,575
Rarou!

984
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:57,170
Planning to trick the Emperor
and keep the drug for yourself,

985
01:28:57,545 --> 01:28:59,372
You've thought this out well.

986
01:28:59,472 --> 01:29:03,835
You are not worthy of
immortality, you warrior!

987
01:29:03,935 --> 01:29:08,431
The one who is worthy is a
genius leader such as myself...

988
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:12,352
Haven't you already lived plenty?

989
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:29,161
What's happening?

990
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:31,288
The foreigner killed his comrade.

991
01:29:31,747 --> 01:29:33,791
There's only...one left!

992
01:30:04,989 --> 01:30:06,449
We met before.

993
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,576
Nanashi!

994
01:30:10,078 --> 01:30:10,829
Use this....

995
01:30:12,705 --> 01:30:13,873
USE

996
01:30:14,332 --> 01:30:15,208
DRUG

997
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:16,543
PAIN

998
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:17,752
GO AWAY

999
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,051
I don't need it.

1000
01:30:27,011 --> 01:30:30,765
I feel like having the pain
is what makes you feel alive.

1001
01:30:34,644 --> 01:30:35,866
That's great.

1002
01:30:35,966 --> 01:30:37,188
That's really great.

1003
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:41,401
I like you more and more.

1004
01:33:54,681 --> 01:33:55,682
Nanashi!

1005
01:34:50,363 --> 01:34:53,741
This is the first time
I've ever been cut.

1006
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:56,536
The pain of a sword,

1007
01:34:56,828 --> 01:35:00,582
Somehow...strange...

1008
01:35:01,082 --> 01:35:03,168
Strange...

1009
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:10,049
A strange feeling...

1010
01:36:09,528 --> 01:36:11,196
You've gotten pretty good.

1011
01:36:11,905 --> 01:36:15,033
Somehow...I feel like
I'm walking on clouds.

1012
01:36:15,575 --> 01:36:16,952
You don't have to flatter me.

1013
01:36:18,078 --> 01:36:19,788
Are your wounds ok?

1014
01:36:20,163 --> 01:36:21,039
Yeah.

1015
01:36:21,331 --> 01:36:23,909
Even a treasure like that came in handy.

1016
01:36:24,009 --> 01:36:24,876
See?

1017
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:26,044
Seriously...

1018
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,005
What a boss.

1019
01:36:36,513 --> 01:36:38,807
Can you see the town yet?

1020
01:36:39,432 --> 01:36:40,725
Not yet,

1021
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:43,603
I'm sure we're almost there!

1022
01:36:44,813 --> 01:36:45,522
Hey...?

1023
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:46,648
Hey?

1024
01:36:47,524 --> 01:36:51,069
After you get better, how about we
cross the sea and leave this country?

1025
01:36:51,695 --> 01:36:53,754
In foreign countries there
won't be anyone who...

1026
01:36:53,854 --> 01:36:55,740
will bother you about
your hair colour, right?

1027
01:36:56,575 --> 01:36:57,659
A foreign country...

1028
01:36:58,451 --> 01:37:00,612
That doesn't sound all bad.

1029
01:37:00,712 --> 01:37:02,039
How will we save up the money?

1030
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:06,460
We can be bodyguards, or
thieves, or anything.

1031
01:37:06,627 --> 01:37:08,963
We can even start a pirate crew!

1032
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:10,506
Man,

1033
01:37:11,257 --> 01:37:13,885
You're just looking for trouble.

1034
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:16,838
I'm going to speed up a bit,

1035
01:37:16,938 --> 01:37:18,264
Hang on tight!

1036
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:21,017
Alright.

1037
01:37:26,814 --> 01:37:27,940
Let's go!

1038
01:42:23,242 --> 01:42:25,678
check and resync by necroboi
