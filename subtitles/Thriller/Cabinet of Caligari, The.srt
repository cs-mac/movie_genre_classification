they have driven me from
hearth and home, from wife and child."

00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,951
"She is my bride..."

5
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:08,953
"What she and I have experienced
is yet more remarkable than the story
you have told me."

6
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:16,954
I will tell you...

7
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:31,644
"In the small town,
where I was born..."

8
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,111

had arrived."

"Come, Francis--
let's go to the fair."

13
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:32,022

Dr. Caligari

00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,277
"Wait!"

16
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,327
"Wait!"

17
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:14,009
"I want a permit to operate
my show at the Fair."

18
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:28,187
"What kind of a show is it?"

19
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,912
"A somnambulist."

20
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:20,617
"Step up! Step up!
See the amazing CESARE,
the SOMNAMBULIST!"

That night the first
of a strange series
of crimes occurred.

24

caused the death of the Town-Clerk..."

26
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,374
"Step up! Step up!
Behold for the first time...

before your very own eyes.
Don't miss this!"

I, Caligari, your master,
command you!"

"Ladies and gentlemen!
Cesare knows all secrets.
Ask him to look into your future."

34
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:06,783
"How long shall I live?"

35
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,734
"Until dawn!"

"The prophecy of the
somnambulist?!"

45
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:36,499
"I will not rest until
I have solved this mystery!"

46
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:59,474
"I shall ask the police
for permission to examine the somnambulist."

00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:48,907
"A Murderer! Help!
A murderer!"

to do with the two murders.
So help me god."

54
00:39:45,930 --> 00:40:00,608
"It's true that I tried to
kill the old woman..."

55
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:11,241
"...and I thought they would blame
the mysterious murderer again..."

56
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:30,288

Dr. Olsen, here..."

Cesare!

60
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:20,777
"It can't have been Cesare.
I've been watching him
for hours, asleep in his box."

00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:51,501
"Let me see him"

65
00:54:38,002 --> 00:54:43,502
Madhouse

66
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:16,356
"Do you have a
patient named Doctor Caligari?"

67
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:55,248
"You may want to ask
the director of the institute directly."

68
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:14,847
"But... HE is Caligari!"

69
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:40,005

SOMNAMBULISM
A Collection from Upsala University
Published in the year 1726

72
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:51,641
"His special studies."

73
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:21,926
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
In the year 1703, a mystic named Caligari visited the small towns

74
00:59:22,928 --> 00:59:30,027
Of Northern Italy traveling around with his somnambulist named Cesare.

75
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:45,032
For months he caused great panic in town after town
by repeated occurences of murder

76
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:51,033
committed always under
the same circumstances.

77
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:16,834
He ordered his somnambulist, who he had brought completely under his control
to carry out his adventurous plans.

78
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:21,935
To evade any suspicion, Caligari put a puppet
which resembled the somnambulist

79
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:30,036
into the wooden box in which the somnambulist used to sleep.

80
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:50,437
My diary

81
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:09,427
March 12th
At Last... At last... A somnambulist was admitted
to the asylum this morning.

82
01:02:55,072 --> 01:03:04,860
...Afternoon.
Now nothing stands in the way of my long cherished ambition.
At last I can put the Caligari theory to the test - -

83
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:14,561
I now shall soon know if this patient can be compelled
to perform deeds he would shrink from in his normal waking state.

84
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Can he be made to commit murder?

85
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:52,717
Obsessions.

86
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,889
"I must know...

87
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:30,190
I must understand his secret.

88
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,891
I must become Caligari!"

89
01:04:58,892 --> 01:05:03,892
You must become Caligari

90
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:18,893
You must become Caligari

91
01:05:23,094 --> 01:05:26,190
You must become Caligari

92
01:05:26,191 --> 01:05:28,191
CALIGARI

93
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,292
CALIGARI

94
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:34,666
CALIGARI

95
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:49,011
End of Act 5

96
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:51,312
Act 6

97
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:37,465
"The sleeper has been found
dead in the ravine."

98
01:08:03,943 --> 01:08:09,138
"Put down your mask -
You are DOCTOR CALIGARI!"

99
01:10:54,731 --> 01:11:00,731
"From this day on this raving madman
has not left his cell."

100
01:12:23,754 --> 01:12:29,754
"See, there is Cesare.
Do not let him prophesize
for you, or you will die!"

101
01:13:09,655 --> 01:13:14,719
"Jane, I love you -
will you marry me?"

102
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:34,396
"We who are of royal
blood may not follow
the wishes of our hearts."

103
01:14:15,134 --> 01:14:20,503
"You all think I am insane. It is not true.
It is the director who is insane!"

104
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:35,308
"He is Caligari!
Caligari..."

105
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,381
"At last I recognise his mania. He believes me
to be the mythical Caligari.
But I think I know how to cure him now."

106
01:16:08,601 --> 01:16:12,748
THE END
