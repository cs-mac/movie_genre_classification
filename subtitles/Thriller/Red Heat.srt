1
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,760
This is not
a foundry worker's hand.

2
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,890
If you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.

3
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,604
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

4
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,439
-He left!
-Where?

5
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,609
Druzhba Cafe!

6
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,777
It's getting harder.

7
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,030
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.

8
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,991
Another 10 years, it'll be like Miami.

9
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,576
It'll never happen.

10
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,745
You're wrong.

11
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,330
You know your new nickname?

12
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,250
The officers called you Iron Jaw...

13
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,128
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.

14
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,130
Actually, I'm circumcised myself.

15
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,178
How's your cold?

16
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,432
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?

17
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,644
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

18
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,857
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.

19
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,402
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.

20
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,487
Let's get them.

21
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,759
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.

22
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,377
Let's go. All of you.

23
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:52,925
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?

24
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:59,223
We are just simple people.

25
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:05,145
Maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.

26
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,731
What's this country coming to?!

27
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,235
This is like the old days!

28
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,571
We are not guilty of anything!

29
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,740
Where is your evidence?

30
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,062
I got his brother in the leg.

31
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,651
Freeze! You are under arrest!

32
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,153
Drop your gun!

33
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,113
Now!

34
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,075
Handcuffs would be a good Idea.

35
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,237
Our informants...

36
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:29,159
...say Rosta fled the county
with two other criminals...

37
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:35,082
...Josip Baroda
and Pytor Tatamovich.

38
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,293
Well find him.

39
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,256
Hell pay far his crimes
against the people.
 
40 
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,185
We're in business.
 
41
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,571
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.

42
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,866
We'll take extreme precaution.

43
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,786
Take this to Colonel Kulikov
immediately.

44
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,122
Then send for Captain Danko.

45
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,250
He is to report as soon as possible.

46
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,253
Good news, comrade.

47
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,631
America.

48
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,384
Chicago. Gangster.

49
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,567
You are being given
a great responsibility, captain.

50
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,988
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.

51
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,408
His two accomplices
are still at large.

52
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:31,915
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.

53
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,877
Our informants say
5 million dollars' worth.

54
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,797
Bring Viktor home.

55
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,509
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.

56
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,053
I repeat, tell the Americans nothing.

57
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,222
Do not discuss our problems.

58
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,182
Bring Viktor to us.

59
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,559
We will avenge Yuri...

60
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:57,357
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the West.

61
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,193
Trust me.

62
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,132
Stand up.

63
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,558
I'm taking you home.

64
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,727
Eat shit.

65
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,672
What is this key to?

66
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,675
Kiss my ass.

67
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,566
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.

68
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,402
I am Moussorsky,
your liaison officer.

69
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,571
We're here from Washington.

70
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,241
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.

71
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,285
We need to know what happened.

72
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,746
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.

73
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,790
There's nothing to report.

74
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,835
Your attitude is disappointing.

75
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,922
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.

76
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,011
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.

77
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,555
Rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.

78
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:09,226
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home...

79
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,729
...through his Georgian network.

80
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,441
We are humiliated before the world.

81
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,985
You've failed.

82
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,529
Report whatever you want.

83
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,782
I've already cabled Internal Affairs.

84
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,746
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.

85
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,249
Your superiors want to see you...

86
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,627
...the moment you land.

87
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:18,406
Greetings, comrade.
We meet in strange places.
