1
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
BELL CHIMES

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,080
Morning!
Morning!

3
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,640
Another drink before lunch, Skelton?

4
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,124
Major, anything to improve
Anglo-American relations.

5
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,024
I spent most of
my life in India.

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,360
WOMAN SINGS ROMANTIC FRENCH SONG

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
BELL CHIMES

8
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
Why did you do that?
I was enjoying it.

9
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,800
It bores me. You were singing it.

10
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,760
It's sentimental. Why not be
sentimental on our honeymoon?

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Oh, yes, of course, our honeymoon.

12
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,240
Happy?

13
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
You ought to know.

14
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,920
Come on.
I'll buy you champagne for lunch.

15
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,240
There's an article here
about the Australian Aborigines.

16
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,000
They catch their fish
with some kind of wooden harpoon.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,600
There's nothing wrong
with my method.

18
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,480
YOU disturbed the fish.
This has got to stop.

19
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Day after day, as soon as I am about
to catch a fish, you come by, paddling!

20
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Hold it!

21
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
Thank you. That was perfect.

22
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,688
We're only too glad. Now perhaps
you'd take one of me by myself?

23
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,000
Sorry, that was my last film.

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,280
< Mr Vadassy, will you be long?

25
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,642
I'm sorry, I couldn't miss those two.
It's my last film.

26
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,999
Yesterday, it was lizards
for your last film.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There must be something wrong with me.
No, you're not such a good model.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,380
You can't stand still.
Because my hair gets in my eyes.

29
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:16,040
Why do you want hair?
It's usual.

30
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,486
I'm terribly sorry.
Forget it.

31
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:22,479
Let's go fishing this afternoon.
I'd love that.

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,025
Good. I must run to the village.
I left my negatives to be developed.

33
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,504
You'll miss lunch.
I'll hurry.

34
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,643
Albert!
Is anything wrong, madame?

35
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,399
How many times have I told you
to decant one bottle at a time?

36
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,480
Now, don't let it happen again!

37
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,800
..Good morning. Madame. I'm glad my
guests are punctual for their meal.

38
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,200
You set a good example. Always
first to arrive. And last to leave.

39
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,040
..Morning, Major. Having fun?
Rather, dear lady.

40
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,560
Morning. ..Madame.
What have you been doing, M Duclos?

41
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
I've had a discussion on marine
biology with our fisherman friend.

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,400
He has a theory that the whale is not a
fish but a mammal. A mammal, I ask you!

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
You have so many interests, M Duclos.

44
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,657
Fools talk and wise men
listen, eh, M Vogel?

45
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:42,560
M Duclos needs a gag. Ssh!
Andre, he will hear you.

46
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,160
I don't care if he does. ..Albert!

47
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
Take this wine away. Champagne
and ice, quickly. Champagne?

48
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,577
You heard. ..Cru '28, isn't it?
Yes.

49
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:56,760
..Bring a bottle at once.
Certainly, madame.

50
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Ah, Miss...? Have you been fishing?
No, I'm going later with Mr Vadassy.

51
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,960
Monsieur, pleasant morning? Yes,
the Major and I discussed politics.

52
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,663
Politics? Yes, of
course we have.

53
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:13,400
I still don't understand
what a republican is.

54
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Don't bother, Major, no-one does.

55
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,080
The same applies to the porpoise.

56
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,880
Everyone knows a porpoise is a fish.

57
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,840
No, they come inshore to breed.
And stay at the best hotels(!)

58
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm serious. In subtropical waters,
the shallows are full of them. Impossible!

59
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,800
It's a biological fact.
I don't believe in facts.

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,960
Mankind is nature's
supreme achievement.

61
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,329
What have you done with your
young man, Miss Skelton?

62
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:49,159
Mr Vadassy?
He's not MY young man.

63
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,200
I never set eyes on him till yesterday.
My wife is a great matchmaker!

64
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,720
He has betrayed me for a lizard.
Her hair doesn't get in her eyes. < Lizard?

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,225
He spent yesterday afternoon
taking her portrait.

66
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,079
He's gone for the photographs,
so he's late for lunch.

67
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,880
At the Hotel Reserve, one is never late
for lunch. I will speak to Mr Vadassy.

68
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Anybody in?

69
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,720
Anybody in?

70
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,120
Yes, monsieur? That roll of film
I brought in, can I have it at once?

71
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,303
It's not ready yet.
Not ready?

72
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:57,759
But you said you'd have it this morning.
It shouldn't take all that time.

73
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,800
When will it be ready? It's not ready yet.
You haven't damaged the negative?

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,280
I wouldn't like anything
to happen to it. Oh, no, monsieur.

75
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,307
If you'd be good enough to
give me your name and address,

76
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll send the boy with it.
No, I'll call again.

77
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,603
It's no trouble.
Your name and address, please.

78
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,080
Peter Vadassy. Hotel Reserve.

79
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,480
Peter...Vadassy...

80
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,000
Hotel...Reserve... It shall
be sent round as soon as it's ready.

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,709
Monsieur Vadassy?
Yes.

82
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:40,760
I must ask you to accompany me
to the police station. What for?

83
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,987
A slight passport formality.

84
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:47,624
My passport is at the hotel.
All my papers are in order.

85
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,240
I don't understand. You will.

86
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,160
DRUNKEN MUMBLING

87
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,440
Vadassy.

88
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Peter Vadassy? Yes.

89
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,760
Your identity card?
I left it at the hotel. Age? 32.

90
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,832
Profession? Medical student.
Scarcely a profession.

91
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,200
I teach languages.
You have a permit? Yes.

92
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,581
Give it to me. If it were necessary
to have a permit to bathe,

93
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,639
I might have it on me(!)
Don't be flippant!

94
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,960
KNOCK ON DOOR
Come in!

95
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
You're German.
No, Austrian.

96
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:09,840
Austrian? I don't carry my
passport everywhere either.

97
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,400
We have your passport here.
And all your other papers.

98
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,720
Have you any other professions besides the
two you mentioned? Or other nationalities?

99
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,696
This is absurd.
My father was Austrian.

100
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:28,160
My mother was French.
I left Austria before Hitler came in.

101
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,886
In another two days, I shall
become a French citizen.

102
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:35,679
I passed my final medical
examination three weeks ago.

103
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,790
Back in Paris, I shall be assistant
house surgeon at my hospital.

104
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,879
And your other activities?

105
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,640
I was only teaching to pay my way
through medical school.

106
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,520
It's always been my ambition
to be a surgeon and a Frenchman.

107
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Teaching languages was my only means.
Your sentiments do you the greatest credit.

108
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,320
Thank you. ..Now, please, may I go?

109
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,240
You are a photographer? It's my
hobby. How many cameras do you have?

110
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,880
One. I can't see why... You're here
to answer questions, not to ask them!

111
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,600
You say you have one camera.

112
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,240
What make is it? Contax.

113
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
That IS my camera.

114
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Were these photographs
taken by that camera?

115
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,520
Yes, those are mine. I took those
yesterday afternoon. The light was good.

116
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Contax is an expensive make. How much
did you pay for it? 5,000 francs.

117
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,520
A lot of money
for a teacher of languages.

118
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,075
Photography is an
expensive hobby.

119
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:20,599
I saved to buy that camera, just
as I saved for this holiday.

120
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,640
It's the first one I've had in five
years. Calm down. I have my rights.

121
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,646
Your rights as what?
A stateless citizen?

122
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:32,440
A doctor without a practice?
A teacher of languages?

123
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,960
Perhaps as an amateur photographer?

124
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
Why pretend any longer, Vadassy?

125
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
I've got nothing
to pretend about.

126
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,520
You took these photographs?
I've said so.

127
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,560
Good. We will examine them together.

128
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,080
JUDGE: On the desk, here.

129
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,040
Take a look.

130
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,680
Lizards...lizards...

131
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,640
lizards...nothing but lizards.

132
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,200
Lizards...liz...

133
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,560
Come on, Vadassy,
don't trouble to look surprised.

134
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,480
Curious lizards, eh, Vadassy?

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,046
I don't understand.
You know that is an excellent photograph

136
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:42,359
of the new fortifications
outside of Toulon.

137
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,000
I suppose you'll say
you've never been to Toulon.

138
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,819
Yes, I spent two hours
in Toulon yesterday.

139
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:55,680
But I left my camera in my
bag at the station. Strange.

140
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,320
But I was only there
a couple of hours.

141
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Peter Vadassy,
you are charged with espionage,

142
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,040
with taking photographs calculated to
endanger the safety of the French Republic.

143
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,680
What's the charge? Espionage. That's why
the chief of naval intelligence is here.

144
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,560
Exactly. That's the way it goes.
That's the way it goes, my friend.

145
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,360
Sit down.

146
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,640
Cigarette?

147
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,920
Thank you.

148
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,541
Why did you admit taking
those photographs?

149
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:57,840
I took all except the first ten.
How do you explain that?

150
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,800
The spool must've been changed. By
whom? I haven't the faintest idea.

151
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,000
My camera never left my suitcase
until I photographed the lizards.

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,360
Do you recognise this? Of course.
Examine it closely.

153
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:28,720
Do you find anything curious about it?
It's exactly as I left it at the hotel.

154
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Then why does your insurance policy
give the the serial number as F2372?

155
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,960
But this isn't MY camera!
This is Z44738.

156
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,360
Why were my photographs
on that negative?

157
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,500
The Toulon exposures were made before
you photographed your stupid lizards.

158
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,599
The cameras were changed.

159
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,627
Then why do you keep me here?

160
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:59,520
You were in possession of photographs
calculated to endanger France.

161
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,206
You face a long term of
imprisonment, deportation

162
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:07,040
and your naturalisation
papers will not be granted.

163
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,207
France will lose an
undistinguished citizen

164
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:14,360
and the Third Reich will gain one.
This is grossly unjust.

165
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,960
You know I am innocent. Possibly.

166
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,000
Vadassy, there are ten guests
at the hotel and Madame Koche.

167
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,160
The guilty one has your camera -
a Contax identical to that.

168
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,840
It is impossible for us to arrest
the entire hotel and search everyone.

169
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,150
Inquiries must be made by someone
whose presence would arouse no suspicion.

170
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,920
I see what you mean.

171
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,080
Yes. It's a pity for both of us that
you're the only person who can help.

172
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,760
But, M... Beghin, is the name.
Michel Beghin.

173
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,258
But I've got to return
on Saturday to Paris.

174
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:59,000
You will remain at the hotel
till you're permitted to leave.

175
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,840
If you try to leave,
you'll be re-arrested,

176
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,880
you'll be deported straightaway
to Vienna

177
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,640
and your dossier will be handed
to the police there.

178
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,798
Get this into your head -
the quicker you find out

179
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:24,559
who took those photographs,
the better for you.

180
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,800
Don't try any tricks.
Don't write any letters.

181
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,320
If you do, imprisonment...

182
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,040
deportation and the Gestapo.

183
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,040
Here is a list I made out for you.

184
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,960
Your fellow guests. Take it!

185
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,387
M Vadassy, you are back!
Nothing serious, I hope.

186
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:15,199
The police were here before lunch.
Nothing serious.

187
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,600
Just a ridiculous mistake about my
passport. However, they apologised.

188
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,640
I apologise to you for having missed
lunch. You know what the police are.

189
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,997
They took a long time to clear
up such a small matter.

190
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:33,719
There was a delay in
getting through to Paris.

191
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,600
I thought the police had priority,
but you can never trust the telephone.

192
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,640
Anyway, I'm back now.
That's the main thing. Yes.

193
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,056
M Vadassy, when are you leaving?

194
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:51,040
We had agreed Saturday morning.
Oh, yes, the day after tomorrow.

195
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,640
The weather's so splendid,
I might stay on a day or two.

196
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,320
Oh, I'm afraid... If the police have
no objection and if you have a room.

197
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,280
I'll see what can be arranged.

198
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
Hello. Remember me?

199
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,200
Oh, yes, of course. The girl by the boat
you photographed this morning. Yes.

200
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Where have you been all afternoon?
A date with a lizard, I suppose.

201
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,720
You did have a date with me to go
fishing. I'm sorry. Aren't you well?

202
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,600
I've got a headache. A touch of the
sun. I think I'll go and lie down.

203
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,504
Is there anything I can do? No.
Shall we see you for dinner?

204
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:44,799
Yes. I'll play you
billiards afterwards.

205
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,520
I'd love to. I'll look forward
to it. Now I'll go to my room.

206
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,080
'The quicker you find out who took
those photographs, the better for you.

207
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,280
'Don't try any tricks
and don't write any letters.

208
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,680
'If you do, imprisonment,
deportation, the Gestapo.'

209
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,680
He misses his lunch, now he misses
his dinner. I cannot understand it.

210
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,466
Everybody isn't like you, Walter.

211
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:29,400
..In Sweden last year,
he never stopped eating!

212
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,440
I didn't want to die
of cold and starvation.

213
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,182
They have very interesting
fish in northern waters.

214
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,280
I can well imagine it.

215
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,360
Harpooning whales all day! And
fighting Eskimos for FISH blubber.

216
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,520
For the last time,
a whale is NOT a fish.

217
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,440
Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to...

218
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,920
Vadassy, good evening.

219
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,840
I beg your pardon, madame.
I'm afraid I'm late. Not at all.

220
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,320
Hello, there.
So, there you are!

221
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,361
Good evening.
Good evening.

222
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,544
Where have you been all day, monsieur?
We missed you.

223
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,880
I went down to the village and... it was
such a glorious day, I forgot the time.

224
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,040
I walked along the coast, over
the cliffs. Which way did you go?

225
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,840
Not very far. Well, quite a long
way. No, thank you, nothing to eat.

226
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,080
You're not eating anything,
M Vadassy?

227
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,931
No, I've got a headache.
A touch of the sun.

228
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,440
A touch of the sun?
You must be careful.

229
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,971
How about a drink, Vadassy?
..Albert, a glass for M Vadassy.

230
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:45,720
No, thanks. I'm perfectly all right.

231
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,013
I never drink champagne.
Nonsense! You look half-dead.

232
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,760
..Doesn't he, my pet?
M Vadassy looks charming.

233
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,760
But champagne is good for everyone.
Take it over, Albert.

234
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,520
I stick always to beer.
I can only drink it with sugar.

235
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,325
Vadassy, be a man.
..Odette, drink up.

236
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:10,639
We've only got one honeymoon.
Vadassy, you are not drinking

237
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,440
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

238
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,680
..Albert.

239
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,240
Perhaps Herr Schimler would like my glass.
Herr Schimler? Yes. Take it over to him.

240
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,040
Sir, there is no Herr Schimler here.
He's sitting over there.

241
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,600
Oh, you mean M Heinberger?
Heinberger? Yes. It's M Heinberger.

242
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm sorry. I'm...a bit confused.

243
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,680
Is your head really bad? I don't
think so. I'm perfectly all right.

244
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,600
Are you sure?
Perhaps I do feel a bit...queer.

245
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Every minute is important. I'll
try again in the morning, Emil.

246
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,920
But I'm afraid it's useless.

247
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,720
You must keep trying for me.
I must know what has happened.

248
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,004
I must know what I have to do.

249
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:21,799
There's nothing you can do, Emil.
Haven't we done all we can?

250
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Month after month of waiting and
planning, and now this has to happen.

251
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Darling. There is so little time. Look,
I promise I'll try again in the morning.

252
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,000
You must.
Tomorrow.

253
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,520
There's nothing we can do tonight.

254
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,640
DOG WHINES

255
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,320
What was that? Wait. I'll see.

256
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,120
DOG BARKS

257
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,120
M Vadassy, is there anything wrong?

258
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,880
Nothing, madame. I couldn't sleep.
I came to look for a book.

259
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,560
I'm going back to my room.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

260
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,000
Good night. Good night.

261
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
There we are, monsieur.
Coffee. Milk.

262
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Butter.

263
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,920
Sugar.

264
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,560
Croissant. Fresh this morning.

265
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Good morning, Monsieur Vadassy.
You are down early.

266
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,840
Do you feel better today?
Yes, thank you. Oh, good.

267
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,360
Have you been here before? No, never.

268
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,019
A medical student doesn't
have much spare time.

269
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:36,840
My son-in-law is a
doctor in Zurich.

270
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,080
Show him the photographs, Liebchen.
..You're interested, M Vadassy? Yes.

271
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,483
This is my daughter.
And this is our grandson.

272
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:49,319
You wouldn't believe I was
a grandmother, would you?

273
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,760
He's such a dear, little boy. That's Ernst,
the doctor. And this is their house.

274
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,360
With the little dog. You know Switzerland?
No. Do you always take photographs?

275
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,301
Yes, I have an album
for each holiday.

276
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:10,600
Were these taken with a half-plate camera?
An Excelsior.

277
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,942
Have you any other cameras?

278
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:17,280
Oh, yes. I have always
been fond of photography.

279
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,082
Have you got them with you?
No, they're in Zurich.

280
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,839
You must visit us.
Yes, I'd like to.

281
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,720
What a glorious morning.
What a deuce of an appetite I've got!

282
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,960
What I wouldn't give
for an English breakfast!

283
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,040
I wonder if the chef could make
porridge? Vadassy, how are you?

284
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,920
I'm all right, thank you.
Had your breakfast already?

285
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,160
Excuse me.

286
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,760
Are you following me?
Unfortunately, yes.

287
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,360
I find it very fatiguing.
And this suit is very hot.

288
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,974
Why do you wear it?
Have you been to a funeral?

289
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:34,040
Four months ago, my mother.
She had stones. Sit down.

290
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,080
Thank you.
I would like to have a grenadine.

291
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,135
Waiter, grenadine for this gentleman.
And for you?

292
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,464
Nothing, thank you.
Nothing?

293
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,612
I'm going to telephone
M Beghin from that box.

294
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:55,040
Stay here and enjoy your drink.
He told me to telephone him.

295
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,785
But it is my duty to come too.

296
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,360
But there isn't room for
two in a telephone box.

297
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,520
But you cannot bribe the honour of a
French policeman with a glass of grenadine.

298
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,160
All right, move your chair that way
and you'll be able to watch me.

299
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,880
TELEPHONE RINGS

300
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes? Peter Vadassy.
Any news about the camera?

301
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,120
Not yet. Then why are you bothering
me? I've discovered something. What?

302
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,920
The German, Emil Schimler,
is calling himself Paul Heinberger.

303
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,160
I heard him talking to Madame Koche
last night. I think he's the spy.

304
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,600
Are you insane?
Well, I thought it might be a clue.

305
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,840
I didn't ask you to play detective.

306
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,080
I asked you to find out which
of the guests had cameras. Find out!

307
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,520
Miss Skelton,
come and have a look at this.

308
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,600
Over there.
What's the matter? It's Mr Asticot.

309
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,440
He looks as though he's drowning.

310
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,899
Give me those.
Who's drowning?

311
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:37,319
Take my binoculars.

312
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,000
He's been caught by an octopus.
It must be a shark.

313
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,040
Poor chap! Give me those.
No!

314
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,320
It is a gigantic shark.
Oh, I say!

315
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,839
What's going on?
Asticot.

316
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,784
All is over.
What happened?

317
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,989
Is he drowning?
Eaten by a shark.

318
00:31:58,013 --> 00:31:59,999
No, it's not a shark!

319
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,960
He's made a wonderful catch.
He's lost it.

320
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,120
No, he hasn't.
It's dragging him under.

321
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,960
He's got it!
It's a giant.

322
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,860
Have I missed something?
I should think you have.

323
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,224
Tremendous sport.
Over there.

324
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,040
That is a fish, isn't it?! Isn't it?

325
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,843
We ought to take a photograph.

326
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,560
I'll get my camera.
And I'll get my Excelsior.

327
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,360
Photograph - what for? If you'd
seen it, you wouldn't ask.

328
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,327
I can't see anything remarkable
about catching a fish.

329
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:51,120
Oh, Andre, it'd be fun
to have a picture.

330
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,400
All right.

331
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,840
Splendid, my friend.
An 80-pounder, by Jove!

332
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,040
Do you think I should hold the fish?

333
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,212
No, it's perfect as it is.
..Where's your camera, Mr Vadassy?

334
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,239
You're missing the
photograph of the season.

335
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,680
I forgot to get a new roll of film.
Just my luck. Today of all days!

336
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,355
Mr Vadassy, would
you please help me?

337
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,024
There must be something wrong here.
If you would straighten it...

338
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,040
There you are. How's that?

339
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,079
I still can't see a thing.

340
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:34,104
Have you dropped your mirror?
Have I dropped...?!

341
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,080
At last!

342
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,920
We're ready now. Hold it.

343
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,520
PHWRRT!

344
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,840
I'm so sorry.
Perhaps there's air in it.

345
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,600
M Asticot, just once more.
PHWRRT!

346
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,920
Walter, do it without the bulb.
Once more? No, Walter!

347
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,320
Bravo! Jolly good show. >

348
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,200
Now, put this round here. I'm so glad
you took my advice about the harpoon.

349
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,120
I didn't. But you weren't paddling.

350
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,686
How are we going to cook it?
This is going to be stuffed!

351
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,544
I have a room at
home full of them.

352
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,400
MUFFLED CHATTER

353
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,960
In the old days, one just wore
ordinary riding... What?!

354
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,840
Who locked me in the writing room?

355
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,800
Are you perfectly sure of that? Yes!
My dear fellow, take it easy...

356
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,680
Old Buffy Davenport, similar case.

357
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,338
Found him crawling round
the compound one morning

358
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:38,919
on his hands and
knees, raving mad.

359
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,640
I know you all think I'm mad.
No, just take it easy. But I was locked in.

360
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,040
Well, it's a bit unlikely.
My dear Vadassy.

361
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,400
It's quite a natural mistake to make.
Perhaps you locked yourself in.

362
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,440
Difficult to do with the key on this side
of the door, eh, M Duclos? Point taken.

363
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,720
This calls for a snifter. One doesn't
catch an 80-pounder every day. Swell idea!

364
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,120
You need a drink, too. What will you have,
my friend? Brandy or champagne or what?

365
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,483
Nothing, thank you.
Nonsense!

366
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:27,719
Come up to my room.
Let Odette fix you a cocktail.

367
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,040
No, thank you!

368
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,981
Thank you very much, not now.
I'm sorry.

369
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:36,304
Cheer up, my friend.
You'll soon feel better.

370
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Where were you when it happened?

371
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,080
What happened? What do you mean?
You know what I mean.

372
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,336
I was locked in the writing room.
Were you?

373
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:05,480
I was sitting over here.
Where have you just come from?

374
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,160
May I ask the reason for
this interrogation? You hypocrite!

375
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,614
Sir, I have not the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

376
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,679
You sit here smiling,
and all the time...

377
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,400
I'm afraid, I'm rather upset.
Forgive me.

378
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,440
Don't go!

379
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,000
Do YOU think I'm mad?

380
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,280
Not at all. THEY all think I am.

381
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,960
They think? Let them think!

382
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm sure you're as sane as I am.

383
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,720
Now, pull yourself together.

384
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,040
What do you say to a game of Russian
billiards? It will calm your nerves.

385
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm no good at this game.

386
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,040
There's only one thing I am good at.
That is?

387
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,840
Photography. Fascinating hobby.

388
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,420
Have you a camera?

389
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:11,160
Will you please not speak while I
make this shot? It is difficult.

390
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,560
Have I a camera?

391
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,600
No, I have no camera. In fact, I can't
remember when I had one in my hands.

392
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,640
Excellent.

393
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,880
M Heinberger has kindly been giving
me lessons. He's a very apt pupil.

394
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,482
We had some difficulties at first,

395
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:41,240
but now we understand one another
perfectly, don't we, Vadassy?

396
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,600
You will always fail if you jab it.
I wasn't thinking. A fatal mistake.

397
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,320
Keep your eye on the ball.

398
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,360
Decide what to do.
Concentrate, then do it.

399
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,849
Don't be in too great
a hurry or you will fail.

400
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:00,920
Your turn. M Vadassy is a novice.
One needs experience.

401
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,880
Yes, one must relax the muscles and
take it easy. You're trying too hard.

402
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,360
Oh! You see? You're back where you
started. Now you must begin again.

403
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,720
So, there you are!
What about that swim?

404
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,423
Are you winning a fortune
off Mr Heinberger?

405
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:23,880
No, Mr Heinberger's winning.
..Excuse me.

406
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,920
I've been wasting your time. Not at
all. Perhaps we'll play again later.

407
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,920
..I'll go and change. How long will
you be? Five minutes. Make it three.

408
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,080
All right.

409
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,280
A charming girl. Yes, and the man?
I don't know. Be careful, Emil.

410
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,240
I know what I am doing. Yes, but
sometimes I'm afraid. Don't worry.

411
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,440
I can look after myself. And him,
too, if necessary. Take care, Emil.

412
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,840
Come along, Peter! Time's up.

413
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Don't move. I'll get a doctor.

414
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,360
You mustn't do that. Why on earth
not? Nobody must know about this.

415
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Don't get excited.
What's been going on here?

416
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,800
I don't exactly remember.
Take it easy.

417
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,200
I must have fainted.
You don't have fits, do you?

418
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,480
No. From the look of the room,
you must've been thrashing round.

419
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,880
What really did happen? Nothing. It's
my sunstroke. I must have fainted.

420
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,727
First, you chewed up
everything except the carpet.

421
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:25,799
Then you fainted. You were
all right when I left you.

422
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,920
I know. It sounds a ridiculous
explanation. It IS ridiculous.

423
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,976
Why not come clean? I can't.
Not now, at any rate.

424
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:37,760
You must think I'm
completely mad.

425
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,920
A little. I can't understand
why you've got to be so mysterious.

426
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,080
Mary, I'd like to take you into my
confidence but...I simply can't.

427
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:49,800
OK, it's your affair.

428
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,840
There's no-one I'd rather tell if I
possibly could, but... But you can't.

429
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,900
The beautiful Romanian
spy has the papers

430
00:43:58,925 --> 00:44:03,239
and the wicked agent has stolen
the secret photographs. Yes.

431
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,040
Mary, keep this to yourself. I don't
want anyone to know. All right.

432
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,440
Thank you. Whatever you do,
keep out of the sun.

433
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,360
TELEPHONE RINGS

434
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,520
Hello? Peter Vadassy. Oh, Vadassy.
Yes? Well, what is it? What is it?

435
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,511
I was knocked out in
my room just now.

436
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:42,960
Did you identify the man?
No, he attacked me from behind.

437
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,275
Your room was searched?
Yes.

438
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,159
Two rolls of film are missing.
Anything else?

439
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,720
No, nothing.

440
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,120
Hello? Hello? Are you still there?

441
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,680
Don't fuss, but listen carefully.

442
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,202
Go back and tell Madame Koche
that your suitcase was forced open

443
00:45:03,227 --> 00:45:06,080
and that several things
have been stolen.

444
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,354
A silver cigarette case, a diamond pin,

445
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:13,120
a gold watch chain
and the two rolls of film.

446
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,708
Make a scene. I want them all
at the hotel to know about it.

447
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:20,040
But do NOT ask for the police.

448
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,240
Do you understand? I can't do that.

449
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,760
Don't argue, but do as you're told.

450
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,926
Was your suitcase forced?
No.

451
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:31,960
Then force it yourself before
you tell Madame Koche.

452
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,000
Is that clear? Yes, but I have
no cigarette case or a diamond pin.

453
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,120
Of course not. They've been stolen!
Get on with it!

454
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,231
Why did he come here to telephone?
There's a telephone in the hotel.

455
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:12,239
And who's the guy with him?

456
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,680
His keeper(!) Another drink?
Swell idea.

457
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,280
Waiter! Vermouth cassis and a whisky.

458
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,040
M Duclos!

459
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,960
M Duclos!

460
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,640
M Duclos!

461
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,720
I want to talk to you.
It's very important.

462
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,271
M Duclos, you're a
man of the world.

463
00:46:56,296 --> 00:47:00,040
Can you give me advice on a
matter of some delicacy?

464
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,729
I am at your disposal.
I have experience of this.

465
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:07,640
But how...?
I am a man of the world. She's charming.

466
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,698
What are you talking about?
Miss Skelton.

467
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:14,119
It's nothing to do with her.
I've been robbed.

468
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,815
A burglary?! My suitcase has been
forced and my valuables taken.

469
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,560
Who could it be? The major?
Possibly.

470
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,600
Roux? Heinberger?
Maybe someone from the village.

471
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,750
You'll help me?
We must inform the police.

472
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:33,000
That would cause a scandal.
Yes. We want to keep it dark.

473
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,720
Naturally. But a few discreet
enquiries. I understand perfectly.

474
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,434
You can rely on me. I'll get
to the bottom of this for you.

475
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,464
You may trust me implicitly.
I do, M Duclos. I do.

476
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,680
M Duclos is coming.

477
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,160
Come here.
A most terrible thing has happened.

478
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,320
M Vadassy has been robbed
of valuable jewels.

479
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,438
Was there violence?
What are we going to do?

480
00:48:37,463 --> 00:48:39,999
Wait. Meantime, not a word.

481
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,320
My watch!
We must go back to the hotel.

482
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:51,560
Have you heard the news? There's
been a burglary in the hotel.

483
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,120
Burglars?
M Vadassy has had everything stolen.

484
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,040
His diamond pin. His pearl studs. And
the watch presented to his father.

485
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,360
Gold?
Yes.

486
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,560
I'm amazed
Vadassy had such valuables.

487
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,480
I understand on the highest authority
he's travelling incognito.

488
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,560
Good Lord! > Yes. So the utmost
secrecy must be observed.

489
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,240
Not a word of this must leak out.

490
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:38,040
Pardon my intrusion. But there's a
gang of crooks at large in the hotel.

491
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,040
They've stolen important papers
from M Vadassy. Secret documents.

492
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,240
It may lead
to international complications.

493
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,989
What's going on, Peter? When I left
you, you were completely down.

494
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:02,839
What's so funny?
Isn't Duclos marvellous?

495
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,775
What's all this about
you travelling incognito?

496
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,120
Did he really say that?
I don't understand. Explain.

497
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,225
Mary, I know this seems
insane, but I think

498
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,639
everything's going to be all right.
I'll take your word for it.

499
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,440
Don't be angry, Mary. I'm not angry.
I'll explain soon, I promise.

500
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,800
He's a genius.

501
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,200
Remember - I can't impress upon you
enough the importance of secrecy.

502
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,240
The peace of the world may depend on it.
I may be summoned to Geneva myself.

503
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,200
(I've already heard from
the Minister of the Interior...)

504
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,040
HE MOUTHS

505
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,302
Excuse me, monsieur.
Yes, Albert?

506
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:02,719
Madame would be grateful if
you'd come to her office.

507
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,160
What's the matter now?
I'll be back in a minute.

508
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,920
Come in!

509
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,280
M Vadassy.

510
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,640
Come in, M Vadassy.

511
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,800
Sit down, monsieur.

512
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,440
I hope you have
some satisfactory news for me.

513
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,400
No, monsieur. None of the staff
could throw any light on the affair.

514
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,469
Most of them have been
with me for years

515
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:58,024
and I'm satisfied they're telling
me the truth. ..You may go.

516
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,000
This is really a case
for the police.

517
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,240
Do you think that's altogether advisable?
I have no intention of calling them.

518
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,470
I don't want any more scandal.

519
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:22,080
I asked you to say nothing until
I had gone into the matter.

520
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,808
You lost no time in doing
precisely the opposite.

521
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,760
I admit that I did discuss
the matter with M Duclos.

522
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,240
M Duclos! M Vadassy, I have now been in
the hotel business for a number of years.

523
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,695
I've met gentlemen
of your kind before.

524
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,360
You broke open the case yourself.
But this is absurd!

525
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:50,040
I assure you, madame... Please,
monsieur, there is nothing you can say.

526
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:56,280
You will leave my hotel tomorrow.
I do not wish the other guests to know why.

527
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,840
You will find some plausible excuse.
Here's your bill.

528
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,720
I cannot say that I hope to see you
again at the Hotel Reserve.

529
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,480
KNOCKS GENTLY ON DOOR

530
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,560
I'm afraid
you'll find nothing of value here.

531
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,960
I... Spare me your excuses.

532
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,640
Now, would you prefer to see
Madame Koche here? Or in her office?

533
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,160
I don't want to see her. I've taken
nothing. There is nothing to take.

534
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,040
Some valuables were stolen
from MY suitcase. I suspected you.

535
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,759
I happen to have discussed
your story with Madame Koche.

536
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,160
She tells me you're leaving.

537
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,200
Under protest. This is part of your
protest? Put it that way if you like.

538
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,200
However, I see that you are not
the thief. I can only apologise.

539
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,786
That will not do. It would be
as well that you stayed here

540
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:33,920
until we discuss this
with Madame Koche.

541
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,440
You can't charge me with anything.

542
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,436
My dear Vadassy, you are
already known to the police.

543
00:56:40,461 --> 00:56:43,840
You came here with the
intention of stealing.

544
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,804
You can explain
yourself to the police.

545
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:50,880
Under what name are you going
to lodge your complaint?

546
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,256
Herr Heinberger?
Emil Schimler of Berlin?

547
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:59,320
Or Paul Czissar of Prague?
So, you're NOT a hotel sneak thief!

548
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,400
I told you I wasn't a thief.
No, you're a filthy, little spy!

549
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,360
KNOCK ON DOOR

550
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,240
Yes? You rang, monsieur?
It was a mistake.

551
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:21,640
That was a fortunate interruption for
you, my friend. I was going to kill you.

552
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,646
Perhaps we can talk sense.

553
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:28,115
I suppose you've never heard
of a man called Beghin? No.

554
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,000
You soon will. He's attached
to naval intelligence at Toulon.

555
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,678
Doesn't that suggest
anything to you?

556
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:40,400
I have a suspicion, Vadassy, that
we're talking at cross purposes.

557
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,280
Who are you? What do you want?
I want a piece of information.

558
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,280
What did you do with that camera? I
don't know what you're talking about.

559
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,840
Then I shall hand you over
for interrogation. You fool!

560
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,920
My reasons for using a different name
are nothing whatever to do with you.

561
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,320
The police know who I am
and so does Madame Koche.

562
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,698
You are trying to blackmail me into
giving information I don't possess.

563
00:58:10,723 --> 00:58:12,639
Am I right?
More or less.

564
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,411
You've seen the passports.
I'll be frank with you.

565
00:58:16,436 --> 00:58:19,959
I daren't let this
information get any further.

566
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,400
That's your affair.

567
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:37,000
Vadassy, in 1933, I was editor of the
Social Democrat newspaper in Berlin.

568
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,880
That year, German social democracy
died a bitter death.

569
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,680
I was arrested by the Nazis
and sent to a concentration camp.

570
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,480
They're not very pleasant places.

571
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,240
I spent two years in that camp.

572
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,360
I finally got my release on the condition
that I resigned my German citizenship.

573
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,800
I went to Paris to work in
an anti-Nazi underground movement.

574
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,652
I was to smuggle
anti-Nazi propaganda

575
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:10,599
between Prague and Berlin,
using the false passports.

576
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,903
The Gestapo found out my name.

577
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:18,200
They tried to kidnap me in Switzerland
and take me back to Germany.

578
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,520
Surely you're safe here?

579
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,160
When you are hunted,
you develop an extra sense.

580
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,040
I thought I had been identified.

581
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,080
I thought YOU might be the man.

582
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,880
I was wrong.
Now, what are you going to do?

583
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,920
If the police know who you are, what
does it matter what name you go by?

584
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,360
They have a hold on me.

585
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,520
My wife and child
are still in Germany.

586
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,360
I can trust you, Vadassy?

587
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,800
Of course you can.

588
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,800
Thank you, my friend.

589
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,480
What about your suspect?

590
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,320
Don't worry. I'll find him.

591
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,120
Where have you been? Any news?
What did you say?

592
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:21,840
Have they called in the police yet?
No. Why not?

593
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,680
It wasn't necessary.
Have they found the thief?

594
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:29,200
No. There was no thief.
I don't understand.

595
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,680
I found my things.

596
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,640
Pressure was brought to bear
from high quarters. The jewels are safe?

597
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,400
Oh, yes. Anybody hurt?
Two gendarmes seriously wounded.

598
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,200
Who were the criminals?
I can't say now.

599
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,240
I must explain.
HILDA VOGEL: Was there a struggle? No.

600
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,320
Will the gendarmes recover?
Now, listen, please, just a minute.

601
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,145
I don't know what
this is all about.

602
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:14,880
There are NO criminals and none
of my property's been stolen.

603
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,400
I found my things under the bed.

604
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,560
They must have fallen down when
my room was cleaned. How amazing!

605
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:28,680
THUNDER CRASHES How did it happen that
the locks on the suitcase were broken?

606
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:35,120
And what about the two wounded gendarmes?
I don't get it. This is all ridiculous.

607
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,720
The only person I discussed this
with, in confidence, was M Duclos.

608
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,480
There was no talk about wounded
gendarmes or broken locks.

609
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,921
Herr Vogel, did you think
the locks had been forced?

610
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:51,679
No, I never said so.

611
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,160
Then, M Roux,
your imagination ran away with you.

612
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,160
What is all this nonsense? That
old fool made up the whole story.

613
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,000
Ladies, gentlemen, I am not in
the habit of betraying confidences.

614
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,490
You deny that you told all of us of the
theft? You said the locks were forced.

615
01:03:11,515 --> 01:03:13,320
In confidence.
Rubbish!

616
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,089
..You heard him, Odette. I did.
Well, he admits it.

617
01:03:17,114 --> 01:03:20,639
In confidence, of course(!)
He invented the lot.

618
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,680
DUCLOS: This is unbearable.

619
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,899
I agree with you, it's unbearable
that we have to put up with you.

620
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:31,079
I resent your impertinence.

621
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:37,720
If you were a younger man, I'd strike you.
M Duclos is an old fool.

622
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:43,280
I beg your pardon?
I said - M Duclos is an old fool.

623
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,040
And you, sir, are a liar. Who stole
the things from Vadassy's room? You!

624
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,655
How else did you know the lock
on his suitcase was forced?

625
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,104
I denounce you liar and thief!

626
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,160
THUNDER CRASHES

627
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,440
Andre! Hasn't this gone far enough?
Andre, please!

628
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,800
Come upstairs. All right!

629
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:25,000
I am sick to death of the lot of
you! You make me sick, all of you!

630
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,200
A pack of gossiping old women!

631
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,960
An extraordinary exhibition!
Quite insane, apparently.

632
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,854
A manic depressive.
I've met many similar cases.

633
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:52,000
I treated him rather well.

634
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,720
Don't you think you deserve a drink?

635
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,760
You're most kind.
Let's all go to the bar.

636
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,924
Of course, the thing
to do is remain calm.

637
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:06,560
The power of the human eye works wonders.
I've made a study...

638
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,735
So, you are just a
common or garden thief.

639
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,240
Mary, you don't understand.
I can't explain just now, but...

640
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:20,880
You said that before. I'm not interested.
It's clear now - I just made a mistake.

641
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,000
ANDRE HUMS

642
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,320
Can't you stop humming that tune?
It's getting on my nerves.

643
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,360
It pleases me.
HE CONTINUES

644
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,640
Don't just stand there -
do something! Don't panic.

645
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,530
There's plenty of time.

646
01:05:49,555 --> 01:05:55,200
If you hadn't bungled those photographs,
we could have gone yesterday.

647
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,720
It's no use going over that again.

648
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,573
It's just our luck that
he had a Contax, too.

649
01:06:01,598 --> 01:06:04,840
How was I to know
they'd get mixed up?

650
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,720
Is the car ready? I'm not going
without those photographs.

651
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,880
Is the car ready?
SHUT UP! Of course it's ready.

652
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,880
What's the matter with you?

653
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,480
There's nothing the matter with me.
I know what I'm doing.

654
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,360
We can't go back to Berlin
empty-handed. Then do something!

655
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,680
Leave me alone!

656
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,760
KNOCK ON DOOR

657
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,800
HE HUMS SOFTLY

658
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,680
Monsieur Vadassy.

659
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,480
Excuse me for intruding.
I came to see if you were all right.

660
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh, of course we are. Come in.

661
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,200
..Good evening. Good evening.

662
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,560
Is that all you came about?

663
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,320
Well, no, I came to ask if you had
a roll of film you could lend me.

664
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,680
Isn't that extraordinary? I was just
saying to Odette that we've run out.

665
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,654
Well, I wouldn't be able to
use it till tomorrow anyway.

666
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:22,000
This is a nice camera.
You didn't use it today.

667
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,226
It was. We have no other camera.

668
01:07:24,251 --> 01:07:29,719
I'm sorry the room is untidy, M Vadassy.
We were getting ready for the party.

669
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,000
For M Duclos's delightful party.

670
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,342
That scene in the hall
was partly my fault.

671
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:40,520
Oh, not a bit. It was foolish
of me to lose my temper.

672
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,200
A drink? Shall we leave Odette
to dress in peace? Why not?

673
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,080
M Vadassy, will you be staying here
long? Well, no. I'm leaving tomorrow.

674
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,120
That's strange, so are we.
How interesting. Well, shall we go?

675
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,560
Vadassy, I like you. I'm going
to put my cards on the table.

676
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,720
It's only fair to tell - and I want
to be fair - I hold all the trumps.

677
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,800
Two days ago, by accident, I made
use of a camera which was not my own.

678
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,840
Now, I took my own camera back, but
a very annoying thing has happened.

679
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,800
Ten negatives were missing.

680
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:38,160
For sentimental reasons, I would
like to have those negatives back.

681
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,960
I value them so highly, I'm willing
to pay 5,000 francs for them.

682
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,680
It's a high price to pay for ten negatives.
But you're a sentimentalist.

683
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,720
Yes. You're lucky to be able to pay
so much for your pleasures.

684
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,370
What do you mean?

685
01:08:57,395 --> 01:09:02,200
Sentimentality seems to be an
expensive hobby, that's all.

686
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,760
Vadassy, I...

687
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,800
..I MUST have those ten negatives.
I'm offering you 500 francs each for them.

688
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,220
Supposing they're not for sale?

689
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:19,199
Listen, my friend, I'm not
playing parlour games!

690
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:25,880
If you won't sell those negatives,
there are other means of getting them.

691
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,560
Herr Heinberger.

692
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,280
Good night. Good night.

693
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,400
Give me those negatives, Vadassy.
No!

694
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,840
Give them to me!

695
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,880
KNOCKING ON DOOR

696
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,880
Forgive me, monsieur. We are
looking for M Vadassy. Peter Vadassy.

697
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,640
This is M Vadassy.

698
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,160
Allow me to introduce you.

699
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,320
Peter Vadassy, you're under arrest.
Why?!

700
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,816
I'm not the man you want.
Let me explain!

701
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:39,504
You can explain at the station.

702
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,440
What is the charge, my man?

703
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,430
That is not your concern, monsieur.

704
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:54,079
I am a citizen of the Republic.
I have a right to know.

705
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,080
The charge is one of espionage.
You've had a spy amongst you.

706
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,720
I knew it from the start!
He couldn't fool Duclos.

707
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:08,560
A spy! I knew he was fishy.
I said so all along.

708
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:14,160
Yes. The moment I saw him,
I said, "There's a dangerous spy."

709
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,760
He tried to bribe me this afternoon.

710
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,400
HILDA: I thought
he was a nice young man.

711
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,800
You know what to do. As instructed.
They'll make a run for it any time.

712
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,426
..Vadassy, glad you've come.
Glad?!

713
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:39,239
Is this another of your idiotic ideas?
I had my hands on the man!

714
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,920
I caught your spy! Don't fuss.
I'm busy. These are yours.

715
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,680
Why have I been re-arrested?
They'll be halfway to Berlin by now.

716
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,760
Look at those -
your naturalisation papers.

717
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,160
My natur...?

718
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:59,280
This means... You are
a citizen of the French Republic.

719
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,200
Don't let it go to your head.
..Here.

720
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,560
Get away from there!

721
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,800
Andre!

722
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,720
Get in!

723
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,160
Emil?

724
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,960
You will follow the inspector.

725
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,960
Roux has taken the coast road to Toulon.
Just as I expected. ..Come along.

726
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,960
Get him an overcoat.
It'll be cold in the car.

727
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,600
Light me a cigarette.

728
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,600
BRAKES SQUEAL
Be careful, Andre!

729
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,920
I know the road.

730
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,840
It was a mistake to shoot him.

731
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,000
Andre!

732
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,120
Thank you, darling.

733
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,760
Do up your coat. You'll catch cold.

734
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,920
Good. You know the road.

735
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,680
Roux's getting into Toulon now.
That's what we've been waiting for.

736
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,325
I think I told you that
we're not interested

737
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,160
in spies but in who
employed them.

738
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,718
We knew that Roux had
taken those photographs,

739
01:15:01,743 --> 01:15:05,199
but we didn't know who
he was taking them to.

740
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,680
We want the others.
There's a big spy ring in Toulon.

741
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,314
Tonight, we're going to smash it.

742
01:15:12,339 --> 01:15:15,799
Why didn't you take me
into your confidence?

743
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:20,200
The less you knew, the better.
I wanted Roux to leave.

744
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:23,480
You were the goat that
baited the tiger.

745
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:28,560
You've had an enjoyable game at my
expense. My profession isn't a game.

746
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,640
I used you
because I wanted to use you.

747
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,705
When you started playing detective
and had your camera stolen,

748
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:40,864
I would cheerfully
have seen you hang.

749
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,720
What are you looking round for?

750
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,820
Police.
Will they follow us to Toulon?

751
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:03,944
What for? They've got Vadassy.
Idiots!

752
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,480
No, thank you.

753
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:21,800
More fool you.
My wife makes an excellent pate.

754
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,880
Andre!

755
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,840
Don't go up there. Why not go over
the border while there's still time?

756
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,760
What are you talking about?
I'm frightened. I love you, Andre.

757
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,554
And I please you a little, don't I?

758
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:17,944
Nice time to choose
for light conversation.

759
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,960
In there, sir. Number 23.

760
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,360
I thought they'd
pulled that place down years ago.

761
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,400
SHIP'S HORN BOOMS

762
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,960
Odette.

763
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,120
Andre.

764
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:56,720
I was wondering what had become of you.
You have had a pleasant holiday?

765
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,760
You have the souvenirs
of your visit?

766
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,680
DOOR CREAKS

767
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,960
Were you followed? ANDRE!
No.

768
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,585
I don't think so.
You don't think so?!

769
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:51,584
Beghin is no fool.
What a mess!

770
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,680
I'm going.
You're doing nothing of the sort!

771
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,360
..Is your car outside?

772
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,280
CREAKING

773
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,440
KNOCK ON DOOR

774
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,680
< Put up your hands, all of you!

775
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,440
This is an unexpected pleasure.

776
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,480
I said all of you, Roux.

777
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,080
Surely this isn't necessary?

778
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,440
This is the gentleman you want.
May I introduce you?

779
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,240
The police, Graf Kurt von Rothenhan.

780
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,440
Von Rothenhan, the police.
Oh, and M Vadassy.

781
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,880
I was forgetting him.
I can show you everything.

782
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,242
That file there, inspector,
will interest you particularly.

783
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:12,464
I've been waiting for
this for a long time.

784
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,000
Drop your gun, Vadassy.
I haven't got a gun.

785
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:02,480
YOU haven't got a gun either
or you'd have shot me in the back.

786
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,320
You wouldn't have waited for me.

787
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,760
You're finished, Roux.

788
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,040
Stop. Stop one moment, please!

789
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,680
Don't let's be foolish, Vadassy.
You know I like you. I always did.

790
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,480
An hour ago, I offered you
5,000 francs for ten negatives.

791
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,040
Sell me ten minutes, Vadassy.

792
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,120
I'll pay you 50,000.
50,000 francs for ten minutes.

793
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,840
It's no good, Roux. You're finished.

794
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,160
You don't understand.

795
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,840
50,000 francs...

796
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,000
You don't hate me, Vadassy.

797
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,880
I don't hate you.
Then, don't do this to me, please.

798
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,440
You want money, don't you?

799
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,960
Lots of money.
That's all anyone wants. Take it.

800
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,680
Take it. 50,000.

801
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,800
50,000 francs for ten minutes only.

802
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,360
I beg you, Vadassy!

803
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,360
Please, take it! TAKE it!

804
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,760
Aaagh!

805
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,920
BELL CHIMES

806
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,960
Albert, what is this noise for?
Madame.

807
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,240
How do you feel now? I feel as if
everything were just beginning.

808
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,600
Is that nice? Couldn't be nicer.

809
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,640
I'm afraid you're going to be
a success.

810
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,411
Dr Vadassy, the
great specialist.

811
01:23:58,436 --> 01:24:02,160
The well-known lizard
fancier who can't swim!

812
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,792
I will beat you...
to the lighthouse and back?

813
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:08,240
You're getting above yourself.

814
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,760
They will be late for lunch.

815
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,600
It doesn't matter for once.

816
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,560
What does it matter?
Let them be happy while they can.

817
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,040
For a few summers.

818
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,720
There's so little time.
