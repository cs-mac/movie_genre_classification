beside me for a moment?

163
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,408
Look.

164
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,613
I have known many
young women like Deirdre,

165
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:18,585
who tend to think
negatively about maturing.

166
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:24,424
I believe in
a beautiful woman,
the present, the past

167
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,960
and the future
are inseparable.

168
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,297
Of course, why,
we all know...

169
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,433
That it's
a woman's attitude

170
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,602
that keeps her
young forever.

171
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,973
We cannot deny,
more than did
the ancient Egyptians,

172
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,309
the importance
of certain aids

173
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,013
to beauty.

174
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,582
(SCOFFS)
You're a saleswoman!
In a sense.

175
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,986
So were Helen of Troy
and Madame du Barry.

176
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,390
It's rather amazing to me
their success considering
they did not know

177
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,494
the secret of
Countess Danielle's
magic foundation.

178
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,297
I don't believe
you know Deirdre at all,

179
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,333
unless you sold
her something.

180
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,437
You don't know her
at all, do you?

181
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,306
Well, do you?

182
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,512
No.

183
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,249
Quite honestly, I don't,
Mrs. Montgomery.

184

from... Yearbooks.

you would appreciate

192
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,249
a good performance
with that background.

194

Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

195
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,564
(SIGHS) I believe
it's the mind
which controls the body.

196
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,601
But my legs do not agree.

197
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,475
Your hand is very cold.

198
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,611
(SIGHS) Yeah.

199
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,216
Despite the good
vibration from yours.

200
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,485
I tend to be

201
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,255
too mystical
for my own good.

202
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,557
No. I think most people
are too practical.

203
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,293
Oh.

204
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,096
One must be practical
in order to survive.

205
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,765
Mustn't one?

206
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,739
I like this cologne,
you know?

207
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,874
Do you?

208
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,377
How could you
possibly tell? (CHUCKLES)

209
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,779
I've smelled it before.

210
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,586
Well, in that case,
you might like some
of our soaps, too.

211
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,289
They're quite expensive.
Three for $5,

212
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,159
but absolutely pure
and transparent.

213
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,527
Quite extravagant.

214
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,264
And also,
our body cream

215
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,266
and our bath oil.

216
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,769
All of the same desperately
exotic fragrance.

217
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,704
I'll take all of them.

218
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,507
Ah! But I can't leave
the samples with you.

219
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,510
I have to write down
the order.

220
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,246
It'll come with the mail
in one week or two.

221
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,882
Oh, don't get up,
please.
No, I must get up.

222
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,185
I must write the order.

223
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:42,889
I must get your full name
and complete address.

224
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,593

your signature to...

Please, please, please.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

226
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,431
No, no. I must get
these things down.

227
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,267
Oh, I must... I must...

228
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,169
Put down the order.

229
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,673
So... Cream. Body cream.

230
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,442
And I must get your money.

231
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,546
You know,
I have a quota to meet.

232
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,284
Each of us has
a quota to meet and
I must meet my quota.

233
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,754
Because, you know,
we work from a system which
is called the quota system.

234

I really want...

Is...

236
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,966
Is to give them to you.

More an attack of

anything else.

244
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,794

on your feet in no time.

both so kind to me.

But I mustn't presume
on your hospitality.

248
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,544
Oh, no, you must feel
right at home here.

249

Mustn't she, Paul?

250
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,414
Oh, sure.

251
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,386

have one day.

00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,900
have to excuse me,

Yes, Schindler.

257
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,339
Excuse me. I'm going
to the, uh, Winthrop Gallery

00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,973
to see about
a couple paintings.

really want a stranger

an artist?

Collecting is an art,
you know.

you'd be the artist

Yes!

with the dead.

Now, just exactly
where in storage is it?

Mmm.

01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:23,766

chicken wire and sand.

Oh, yes.

Uh, two bags.
Two bags full, uh, inside.

a little more, uh, body.

Yes, indeed.

to know the final count, huh?

Ten percent of everything.

That's 43,900.
I made it an even 45.

1012
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,424
I guess I'm just feeling
a little generous today.

1013

Norman's family
$1,500 for the funeral.

he was expecting 500.

Well, he was expecting blanks,
not bullets.

Frankly, I think he would
have done it for nothing.
