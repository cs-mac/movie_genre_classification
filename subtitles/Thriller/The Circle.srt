1
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,497
Yes, we received your payment.

2
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,418
No, it wasn't late, but it was for $78.13,

3
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,879
and the bill was for $78.31.

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,147
"I am going to correct."

5
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,674
Okay. Great.

6
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,600
"- There was something else?"
- No, thank you.

7
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,720
"- Merci."
- Merci à vous.

8
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,936
I think it's the intake manifold.

9
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,524
- Was I right?
- Not even close.

10
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,987
I think I just like saying
«intake manifold».

11
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,532
Maybe when I get a job, I'll get AAA.

12
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,192
I thought you worked at the water company?

13
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,535
Temping-

14
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,871
how's your parents?

15
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:25,956
They're doing okay.

16
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,752
I should, um, get going,
actually, for dinner,

17
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,047
but, um, we should make a plan.
I'll send you a text.

18
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:38,385
Or we could do that now
since we're both here.

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,429
- What?
- Nothing.

20
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,973
Okay.

21
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,771
Nice of Mercer.

22
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,648
I always thought you two
would make a good...

23
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,151
- Mom.
- ...Couple.

24
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,323
Boy from the neighborhood?
That would've been cute.

25
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,244
Remember when he fixed the roof?

26
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,788
Stop. He's not...

27
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,332
I know, I know.

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,678
Any word on the insurance?

29
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,516
Uh, they won't cover the cost of IgIv.
It's $40,000.

30
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,561
So, you know, surprise, surprise!
It's not on their list.

31
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,482
Oh, enough of all that. Come on, honey.

32
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,652
- Help me up.
- Okay.

33
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,198
Here, you got it?

34
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,908
Thanks, Mae.

35
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,785
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,203
That's it.

37
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,790
Well, not so fast.

38
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,631
Okay, and turn, just...

39
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,926
You Okay?

40
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,553
- Yeah, I'm good now.
- Okay.

41
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,686
"What are you doing right now?"

42
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm at work.

43
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,900
I come here each day, and in return,
I receive money to buy goods and services.

44
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,821
"Oh, well, I've got to be quick,
I'm in Germany."

45
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,031
Why are you in Germany?

46
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,943
"Regulatory mess.
Those guys do not screw around."

47
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,866
"- But listen, I got you an interview!"
- What?

48
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,326
"I got you an interview tomorrow."

49
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,454
"Yes, I did."

50
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,123
Really? No.

51
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,126
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I did. Tomorrow."

52
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,629
Holy shit. Annie, I love you.

53
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,631
"Remember, it's just Customer Experience,"

54
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,909
"so answer phones, help people,
what you're already doing,"

55
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,978
"but now, a real company."

56
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,324
I know. It's perfect.

57
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:45,603
"Tons of people started there."

58
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,014
I know, I know. Thank you.

59
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,725
"Stop saying that. We're hiring
a hundred people this month."

60
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,645
"- One of them might as well be you. "
- Right. Good.

61
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,025
"This doesn't mean you're in.
You have to kill the interview."

62
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,316
"Know The Circle inside out.
I'm back next week."

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,902
"By then, you'll be hired
if you kill the interview."

64
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,197
- Okay. I will.
"- You can do it, Mae. Own it!"

65
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,171
"How would you describe what The Circle is"

66
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,090
to, say, your grandmother?

67
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,092
Take «Trueyou», for example.

68
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:29,264
It combined everything that was separate
and sloppy into one account.

69
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,683
No more forgetting your password,

70
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,352
multiple identities, identity theft.

71
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,564
You use your real name, which is tied
to your credit card...

72
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,149
I think grandma's falling asleep.

73
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,820
Okay.

74
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,742
Before Trueyou,

75
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,744
it was like you needed a different vehicle

76
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,746
for every single one of your errands.

77
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,999
And no one should have to own 87
different cars. It doesn't make sense.

78
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,794
It's the chaos of the web
made elegant and simple.

79
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,464
Speed round. Paul or John?

80
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Early Paul, late John.

81
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,218
- Mario or Sonic?
- Early Sonic, late Mario.

82
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,512
Introspection or communication?

83
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,640
Uh...

84
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,850
- Mae?
- Sorry, I'm thinking about it.

85
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,311
So, that's introspection.
Sushi or soylent?

86
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,605
- Sushi.
- Ever owned a Velcro wallet?

87
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,316
- Yes.
- Velcro shoes?

88
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,402
- Yes.
- Velcro pants?

89
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,654
Yes.

90
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,346
What was the name of the receptionist
who checked you in this morning?

91
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,726
Um...

92
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,955
Linda.

93
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,831
Joan Baez or Joan Crawford?

94
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,875
- Joan Didion.
- «Gif» or «Jif»?

95
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm not answering that,
there's too much at stake.

96
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,273
Would you like to go out with me?

97
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,343
That's very inappropriate.

98
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,429
Good. Quality or convenience?

99
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,181
Not mutually exclusive.

100
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,350
Needs of the society
or needs of the individual?

101
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,352
- Should be the same.
- You're most scared of?

102
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,690
Unfulfilled potential.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!

104
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,503
All right. Heliport, gym,
daycare, organic farm, pétanque.

105
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,880
- Pétanque?
- Oh, it's like bocce but French.

106
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,298
Oh.

107
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,343
Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, yoga.

108
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,059
Kennel, night club, salon, maker space,

109
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,188
rock climbing, trampoline,
clinic, volleyball.

110
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,940
Was that... Was that the...

111
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,359
Content people, news,
arts, film, engineers,

112
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,113
management, and me, advertising, and you.

113
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,701
All right. Let's go.

114
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,954
Your legs are so long.

115
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,086
What?

116
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,088
It's all on sensors.

117
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,215
The elevator reads your ID
and it says, «Hello.»

118
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,802
We do that for visitors mostly.
They're usually impressed.

119
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,721
Annie, that's the worst
picture of me ever.

120
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,390
Oh, come on... Oh. Oh, dear.

121
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,933
- Danny!
- What's up?

122
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,644
So, you remember Dan?
I'm handing you up, you're all grown up.

123
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,565
I have the privilege and the honor
to give you your brand new tablet, Mae,

124
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,192
and I sent the password to your phone.

125
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,985
- Oh, my God. It has my name on it.
- Uh-huh.

126
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,154
Oh, this is too sad.
You take care of my little girl.

127
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,239
I will.

128
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,784
If we don't give customers
a human and humane experience,

129
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,869
we have no customers.
It's pretty elemental.

130
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,579
Jared will be doing your training.

131
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,874
I oversee the team,
and Jared oversees the unit.

132
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,877
As you know, you'll be doing
straight up customer maintenance

133
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,962
for the smaller advertisers.

134
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,839
You work in your portable here.

135
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,633
It's gonna match the customer experience,

136
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,052
and it gets routed over to one of you.

137
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,721
Random at first. But once you start
working with a customer,

138
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,808
they'll continue to be routed over to you
for the sake of continuity.

139
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,185
You get the query, figure out the answer,

140
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,313
you write them back,
and that is the core of it.

141
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,232
Simple enough in theory. So far, so good?

142
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,942
- Yeah.
- Cool.

143
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,196
So, let's say you've answered a client's
question and they seem satisfied.

144
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,203
Now, it's not just that you
get a smile or a frown,

145
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,028
though that is part of it,
you get your smile...

146
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,532
It's almost always a smile.

147
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,079
Um, that is when you send the survey.

148
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,540
The survey is a set of quick questions
about, you know,

149
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,333
your overall service, how you did,

150
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,379
and they send that immediately back
and you get to see how you did right here.

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,131
That is the rating. Uh, you know what?

152
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,632
Let's just do a live one.

153
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,552
- Excuse me. Okay.
- Sorry.

154
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,556
...nice day.

155
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,269
That's pretty good.

156
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,150
Ninety-nine is good, but I can't help
wondering why it wasn't one hundred.

157
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,911
Let's look.

158
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,234
Okay..

159
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,407
Boom. Sometimes you just encounter someone

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,409
who isn't really sensitive to the metrics,

161
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,996
so it's important to ask them
and make sure you get that clarity.

162
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,665
And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.

163
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,376
Oh, wow.

164
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,045
All right. Are you... Are you ready
to do this on your own?

165
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,130
- Yes.
- Awesome.

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,929
"Excuse me! Terribly sorry."

167
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey, how's it going?

168
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,859
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.
- Oh, just for a day.

169
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,329
Then London, then New York, now here.

170
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,374
- Have you slept?
- A few hours on the plane.

171
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,897
A couple of pills, I'm good.
So you, first week?

172
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,649
- Ugh.
- What?

173
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,276
You have an 87 average.
That's like a solid b.

174
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,444
How long till I'm fired?

175
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,643
Listen, when I first started,

176
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,086
it took me a few weeks to really get
the hang of it, believe me.

177
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,560
Okay? Believe me, you're doing fine.
You're good, all right?

178
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,120
"Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey."

179
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,165
Thanks.

180
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,630
Thank you, thank you.
So glad to see you all here.

181
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,300
Now, a bunch of you are new
to the company since I last spoke,

182
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,970
so can the guppies all stand up?

183
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,722
- Right. That's you. Get up.
- Come on, guppies, just stand up.

184
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,432
Guppies, stand up, come on.

185
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,519
Congratulations. Nice to have you.

186
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,523
Now, now, guppies is just
an affectionate term for you baby fishies.

187
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,235
Soon, you will all grow
to become powerful...

188
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,821
- You're adorable.
- I hate you.

189
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,740
The... The fish that guppies
grow up into be...

190
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,119
what, what do they grow up into?
I don't know. Anyway.

191
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,371
All right, this is dream Friday,

192
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,909
the latest in our long tradition of
presenting our newest innovations.

193
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,085
The first dream Friday
featured Ty Lafitte,

194
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,587
the inventor of Trueyou
and our founding father.

195
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,882
And usually, we feature
one of our engineers or our visionaries,

196
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,010
but today, unfortunately, it's just me,

197
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,554
and for that, I apologize in advance.

198
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,598
"- We love you, Eamon!"
- Thanks, mom.

199
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,353
Now, you might not have seen me around
campus for the last few days,

200
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,605
and maybe you're wondering
just where the heck I've been.

201
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,191
"Surfing!"

202
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,737
Argh, you got me. Yes, I've been surfing.

203
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,114
And that's part of what
I'm here to talk about.

204
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,285
I love to surf, and in the past,
I would have to wake up

205
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:52,582
and call the local surf shop
to ask about the local breaks.

206
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,128
And pretty soon, the local surf shop
stopped answering their phone.

207
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,092
And then I got a cell phone
and I could call up my buddies

208
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,303
who were already out
at the beach before me.

209
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:10,475
And I could ask them, but they too
stopped answering their phones.

210
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,562
And then came... The Internet.

211
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,565
Whoa.

212
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,319
Some geniuses set up cameras
on the beaches,

213
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:27,158
so I could log on and get some very crude
images of the waves at Stinson beach.

214
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,578
It was almost worse
than calling the surf shop.

215
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,954
Here's how it used to look.

216
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
Almost useless, right?

217
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,711
But now, let's refresh that page

218
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:44,258
and show the site with our new circle
video delivery.

219
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,719
Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?

220
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,597
Yeah, maybe I should be
out there right now.

221
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,724
But would it surprise you to know

222
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,603
that this is not coming
from some big camera,

223
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,065
but actually just one of these?

224
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,112
This camera needs no wires.

225
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,615
It transmits this image via satellite.

226
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,326
I set up that camera this morning.

227
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,205
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes
with no permit, nothing.

228
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,957
In fact, no one even knows it's there.

229
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,459
And actually,
I was pretty busy this morning

230
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,337
because here's rodeo beach,

231
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,590
Montara, Ocean Beach,

232
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,177
fort point, this is my front yard.

233
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,515
And here's my backyard.
Here's traffic on the 101.

234
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,143
Oh, did you think this was just a camera?

235
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,396
No. Welcome to real-time
analytic processing.

236
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,774
When you see this,
you're also getting this.

237
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,697
Air quality, traffic volume,
weather patterns,

238
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,824
biometrics, facial recognition,

239
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,327
saved and searchable,
all to serve you better.

240
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,456
My friends, we are looking
at retailing these

241
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,169
in just a few months
for less than a pair of jeans.

242
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,588
And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.

243
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,674
I'm talking about the ones
like I'm wearing.

244
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,181
Now, Circlers, do you like to share?

245
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,974
"Sharing is caring!"

246
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,393
Sharing is caring.
I thought you might say that.

247
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,270
- Sharing is caring?
- Sharing is caring.

248
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,507
Well, I have a dozen helpers
all over the world right now

249
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,066
carrying these cameras.

250
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,570
Imagine the human rights implications.

251
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,949
Activists no longer have
to hold up a camera.

252
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,660
Now it's as easy
as gluing a camera to a wall,

253
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,455
and actually, we've done just that.

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,251
Do you see any cameras here? No.

255
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,339
We have 144 cameras in place here,

256
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,592
and it took us just a day to do it
and they're virtually invisible.

257
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,429
They come in every color,
so camouflaging is a cinch.

258
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,681
This is my favorite. Oh!

259
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,518
Nice catch. Sign her up.

260
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,898
So now, the entire world is watching.

261
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,650
You know, I agree with the Hague,

262
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,277
with the human rights activists
all over the world.

263
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,905
There needs to be accountability.

264
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,784
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.

265
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,703
We will see them. We will hear them.

266
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,291
We will hear and see everything.
If it happens, we'll know.

267
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,463
We're calling it SeeChange.

268
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,759
SeeChange.

269
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,055
Oh, and we'll go to good things, too.

270
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,725
- Aw!
- Aw!

271
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,435
We will see it all

272
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,772
because knowing is good...

273
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,692
But knowing everything is better.

274
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,046
Good thing you guys like
to keep things modest.

275
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,840
What's this party even for?

276
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,509
SeeChange, summer solstice,
everything, nothing.

277
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,881
Come on. Let's be the only ones here
that know how to dance.

278
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,055
Oh, my God, is that Beck?

279
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,379
So Bailey... What's he actually like?
You're in the gang of 40s.

280
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,757
Yeah, but I don't get a ton
of alone time with him.

281
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,509
I mean, you know, a lot of people work
in the white house,

282
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,762
but how many people really
get to know the president?

283
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,723
Oh, actually, do you wanna see something?

284
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,975
Oh, my God, you need to see this.
Follow me.

285
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,358
Okay. This is it.

286
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,822
Nice knocker.

287
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,868
Holy shit, right?

288
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,954
Right?

289
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,415
I think all of these
have got to be first editions.

290
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,794
Oh, but, urn, you have to give me
a verbal nondisclosure agreement, okay?

291
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,337
- Annie...
- Seriously!

292
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,651
We shouldn't be here
and probably won't ever be here again,

293
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,674
so verbal N.D.A.
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

294
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,178
I promise not to disclose anything.

295
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,516
Good. This is where Bailey and Stenton
make all of their plans.

296
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,435
It's very serious.

297
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,062
I mean, this is high nerd, right?

298
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,147
Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...

299
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,859
With this?

300
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,612
You're such a dork!

301
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,614
Wow.

302
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,491
So, this is where it all happens.

303
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,369
To be a fly on the wall, right?

304
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,037
We should get back to the party.

305
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,498
Well, you should, at least.

306
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,002
- You're not coming back?
- Got work.

307
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,754
Annie, it's like 11:00.

308
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,506
I've got Australia in a few minutes. Ah!

309
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,820
Ah-ha, actually, a few minutes ago,
but you have fun, okay?

310
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,177
- Annie!
- You're gonna have so much fun.

311
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,411
So, I heard there's a party around here.

312
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,540
You know, if that's,
like, your kind of thing.

313
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,960
Yeah, maybe I'll check it out.

314
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,088
It's probably not as interesting
as whatever's on your phone, though.

315
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,634
Okay, probably not.

316
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,892
You want a drink?

317
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,144
I do, but they ran out, like, an hour ago.

318
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,146
I think they did, too, but shh...

319
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,194
Are you serious? Whoa.

320
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,237
You have glasses in there, too?

321
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,031
It's my, uh, party trick.

322
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,993
Oh.

323
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,661
All right.

324
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,163
Thank you.

325
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,463
You're new here. You are, right?

326
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,006
How can you tell that?

327
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,466
I don't know, I just guessed.

328
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,051
That's really embarrassing.

329
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,096
Sorry. What do you think?

330
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,225
- Of this?
- Yeah.

331
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,520
I'm excited.

332
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,981
Mm-hmm.

333
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,194
- Sorry...
- Okay.

334
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,490
it's just that everyone that works
at The Circle is so excited to be here,

335
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,910
and they just want to tell
everyone about it all the time,

336
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,579
You know, it's just...
Like, here, try this kool aid!

337
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,998
- Delicious! You'll love it!
- Kool aid? Oh, wow!

338
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:17,044
I love kool aid. Don't you love kool aid?

339
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,882
After my last job, where I just tried
to calm down angry people all day...

340
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,177
I'm just grateful to be here.

341
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,097
I gotta go put out a fire.

342
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,682
Sounds exciting.

343
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:34,603
Very. So, uh, I'll leave you to it.

344
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,107
Have a drink, have a good time,
and stay excited.

345
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,441
You're at The Circle!

346
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,698
Whoo! Hey!

347
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,158
Did he tell me his name? I forgot it.

348
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,787
- Stupid.
- Have a good night, guppy.

349
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,956
Oh... Thanks.

350
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,917
"The last shuttle will be
leaving in five minutes."

351
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,740
"I'm telling you, Mae-Mae,
there's something about you."

352
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,616
"You have a glow."

353
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,035
"You do!"

354
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,536
"I do not have a glow."

355
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,413
Like you're with child.

356
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,750
Ignore him.

357
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,251
So, it's been great?

358
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,921
I don't think I ever want
to work anywhere else.

359
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:47,217
I told, um, Carolina's mom...
Might've let your salary slip.

360
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,927
- Oh, mom.
- What?

361
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,723
It's been fun to casually insert it
into conversation.

362
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:57,102
«My daughter works for the best company
on the planet...»

363
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,604
«And has full dental!»

364
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,273
Please don't. I just got lucky.

365
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,069
- If it wasn't for Annie...
- Annie, how is Annie?

366
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,072
She's good. Working too hard.

367
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,907
What does she do, exactly?

368
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,327
She's in the gang of 40.

369
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,661
Uh-huh.

370
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,332
She's in on all the big decisions...

371
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,959
Deals with the regulatory issues
in other countries.

372
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,337
That sounds so important!

373
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,134
Mae, hon, would you get
your daddy another beer?

374
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,136
Sure, dad.

375
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,028
Your hair.

376
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:52,408
- It was a phase.
- It was a cute phase.

377
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,827
You good?

378
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,412
I'm good.

379
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,039
You should come visit me at work sometime.

380
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,457
At The Circle?

381
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,753
I'll give that idea a smile, right?

382
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,713
They might think I was there
to clean the toilets.

383
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,842
Come on. They'd love you.

384
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,886
All those tech guys secretly wish
they knew how to use a handsaw,

385
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,513
make something out of wood.

386
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,432
That really sums me up pretty well.

387
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,434
It could be worse, I guess.

388
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,227
You know what I mean.

389
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,813
They'd want you to tell them
about your secret hiking spots.

390
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,442
Oh, so they can put them on Trueyou,
ruin it forever?

391
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,902
Ooh, biting commentary.

392
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,654
I mean, come on, you have to admit,

393
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,324
like, smiles and frowns
used to be for middle school.

394
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,119
Like, «hey, you know,
do you like stickers and unicorns?»

395
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,622
«Yes, I love stickers and unicorns.
Smileys!» You know, and now...

396
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,249
Now it's everyone.

397
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,836
I can't help it if you're not... Social.

398
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,213
I am social enough. I mean, isn't...

399
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,425
This socializing?

400
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,679
I assume you've heard about that senator
that's trying to, like, break you guys up,

401
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,264
citing antitrust laws, right?

402
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,932
Give me a break, Mercer.

403
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,016
Don't you have to go
and chop some wood or something?

404
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,233
- Thanks, hon.
- Sure, dad.

405
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,820
His business is doing well.

406
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,323
Mercer? The antler chandeliers?

407
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,784
They are beautiful, Mae.
He's making one for us.

408
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,828
Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?

409
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,830
They say that's pretty good for a guppy.

410
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,793
- Who's a guppy?
- Well, that's great, Mae.

411
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,464
Bonnie...

412
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,343
Hmm? Oh, come on,
we'll go in the house. Come on.

413
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,803
- Dad?
- Honey...

414
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,722
- What happened?
- Please, Mae, let your mother.

415
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,683
Honey, just... Just... Just tell everybody
that dad's not feeling very well,

416
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,642
and they'll understand, really. It's okay.

417
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,647
It's okay. It's okay.

418
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,023
Dad...

419
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,608
Please, Mae.

420
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,653
We got it.

421
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,196
It's okay.

422
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,450
Come on.

423
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,754
See you soon, Mae.

424
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,215
Bye.

425
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,824
"Today, I call upon
the senate antitrust subcommittee"

426
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,868
"to investigate The Circle."

427
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,205
"We cannot rely on them to say,
«we're not violating antitrust laws»."

428
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,250
"I'm sure The Circle will be
glad to cooperate."

429
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:34,004
"We have every confidence
that senator Williamson's allegations"

430
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,464
"will be discredited."

431
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,924
You were probably wondering
about your new screen.

432
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,176
Hi, I'm Gina.

433
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,011
- I'm Matt.
- Hi.

434
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,805
Dan said this would be a good moment
to set up all your socials.

435
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,223
- Do you have time?
- Sure.

436
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,226
- Great.
- I take it last week

437
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,646
you were too busy to set up
your company social account,

438
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,398
and I don't think you've imported
your old profile.

439
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,901
Sorry, I've just been
kind of overwhelmed so far.

440
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,736
- Oh.
- No, in a good way.

441
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,698
I just haven't had time yet
for extracurricular stuff.

442
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,033
Wow.

443
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,285
That's so interesting you put it that way.

444
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,330
We actually see your profile
and the activity on it

445
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,624
as integral to your participation here.

446
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,044
This is how your coworkers, even the ones
on the other side of campus,

447
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,712
know who you are.

448
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,049
Communication certainly
isn't extracurricular, right?

449
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,301
Right! Of course.

450
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:25,305
We consider you a full, knowable person
of unlimited potential,

451
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,974
and a crucial member of the community.

452
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,060
But you're such an enigma.

453
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,520
I am?

454
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,399
It's been years since someone so shrouded
in mystery started here.

455
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,858
Everyone really likes you.

456
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,945
Your work's been exemplary,
strong ratings for your first week.

457
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,031
Are you satisfied with your performance?

458
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,450
Uh, I think I can do better.

459
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,203
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?

460
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,539
It's also about community.

461
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,917
- Of course.
- It's all connected.

462
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,169
But you've had a blip or two

463
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,588
when it comes to meshing
with the community,

464
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,633
like your absence at several weekend
or evening events,

465
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,261
which are, of course, optional.

466
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,346
- I'm sorry?
- Let's start with this weekend.

467
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:12,310
You left campus at 11:42 P.M. on Friday,
and got back 8:46 A.M. Monday.

468
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,938
Was there work on the weekend? I didn't...

469
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,023
- oh, no, no, no, no.
- So sweet.

470
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,859
There wasn't mandatory work
on the weekend.

471
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,279
This isn't like a clock in, clock out
type place, thank God!

472
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,234
But, you know, there were
thousands of people here,

473
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,100
participating in a hundred
different activities.

474
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,111
So many!

475
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,829
I'm sorry, I...

476
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,625
My dad had an... An episode,
and I was home helping out with that.

477
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,170
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is that related to his MS?

478
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,174
Uh... Yeah.

479
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,384
We didn't know anything
about this incident.

480
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,970
Did you reach out to any Circlers
during this crisis?

481
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,472
Annie, anybody?

482
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,891
Uh, no, I... No.

483
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:55,145
Mae, there are four groups here
for staffers dealing with ms,

484
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,732
two of them for children of ms patients.
Have you sought out a group?

485
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,193
I didn't know...

486
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:06,698
Okay. Can you talk about what you did
the rest of the weekend?

487
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,367
Nothing, really. I just... I kayaked.

488
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,120
You kayaked? With who?

489
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,164
Nobody. Just on my own.

490
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,126
I kayak. We could've kayaked together.

491
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,253
Nothing on your profile about kayaking,

492
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,839
no smiles, no ratings, no posts?

493
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,466
I'm no psychologist,

494
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,344
but this behavior sometimes stems
from low self-worth.

495
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:32,265
This is what participation is all about,
bringing you, lifting you up...

496
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,477
Thus, your participation window.

497
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,730
I can't believe you've been here this long
without being on the main social feed.

498
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,483
You're about to have your world rocked!

499
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,361
See, these are all
of last week's messages.

500
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,238
That's why there's so many.

501
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,157
- 8,000?
- Mm-hmm!

502
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,828
Looks like you have a lot
of catching up to do here. A feast!

503
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,204
Have fun!

504
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,791
Oh, forgot. One more thing.

505
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,711
This is your participation rank,
«parti-rank» for short.

506
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,964
Some people here call it
the popularity rank,

507
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
but it's not really that.

508
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,759
It's just an algorithm-generated number

509
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,720
that takes into account all your activity
in the inner circle.

510
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,515
- That make sense?
- I think so.

511
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,851
Okay. And again, it's just for fun.

512
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,770
- It's just for fun!
- Okay, bye.

513
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,115
"It's been a long...
When are you coming home? We miss you!"

514
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,617
I can't! You know.

515
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,912
"How's the dorm?
Do you have to clean your own room?"

516
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,497
- They have people to do that.
"- Ooh, thank God."

517
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,874
How's dad?

518
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,711
"He's okay. He... He fell yesterday,"

519
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,173
"and I couldn't lift him up,
but thank God, Mercer came by."

520
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,633
"He's stronger than I thought."

521
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,052
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,304
I should've been there.

523
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,064
Is that one of his?

524
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,108
"Yeah! I think it's his best work."

525
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,902
It's awesome.

526
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,822
I gotta go, mom.

527
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,367
- I love you.
"- Okay, well, bye."

528
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,534
- Bye.
"- Bye."

529
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,761
"I'm so sorry about last week."

530
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,973
I've been up my own ass,
and I didn't mean to be a shitty friend.

531
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,016
It's okay. Where are we going?

532
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,061
Listen, I've been looking
into your parents' situation,

533
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,314
and I think I have an idea.

534
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,024
- All right?
- Yeah.

535
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,234
- Hi!
- Hi.

536
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,154
- This is Jessica. This is Mae.
- Hello, Mae, how are you?

537
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,532
I understand you haven't done
your medical intake yet.

538
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,658
No.

539
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,034
Can you drink this for me?

540
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,708
All of it, if you can.

541
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,964
I told you about Mae's dad.

542
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,718
Mm. Multiple sclerosis.
I did my post-doc on Ms.

543
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,469
I'd love to get some real-time data.

544
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,222
There you go.

545
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,893
How does this feel?

546
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,228
Warm.

547
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,647
Oh, is this for free?

548
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,817
Of course. You get to keep it.

549
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,986
So, it's gonna feel warm for a few days.

550
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,447
Then you and the media band
will get used to each other,

551
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,408
but it has to touch the skin to work.

552
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,952
Waterproof, no need to take it off.

553
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,954
Let's activate it, shall we?

554
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,540
Is that the...?

555
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,210
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor
you ingested a second ago.

556
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,382
And now...

557
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,342
Let's have you walk around the room.

558
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,723
Briskly.

559
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,936
It'll collect data on your heart rate,
blood pressure, cholesterol,

560
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,773
sleep duration, sleep quality,

561
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,650
digestive efficiency, on and on,

562
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,696
and all that data is stored in the cloud
and in your tablet, anywhere you want,

563
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,283
and, of course, it's all collated
with the rest of The Circle.

564
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,118
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see

565
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,621
and the problems we can avoid
when we have all that data.

566
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,956
Speaking of which, I was thinking
it would make sense

567
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,542
for Mae's folks to come
on The Circle health plan.

568
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,377
Uh, wait, what?

569
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,129
It wouldn't be the first time,

570
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,590
and I'd really like to get
real-time data from your dad.

571
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,674
Sit back down.

572
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,385
Can you get in touch with hr, clear it
with them,

573
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,387
- tell them I say it's a go?
- Yep. Absolutely.

574
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,934
We'll send someone out
to set them up, okay?

575
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,189
"Honey, this is gonna save our lives!
Thank you!"

576
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,565
"Thank Annie, too!"

577
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,651
- They thank you.
- Oh!

578
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,821
"This is so great!
Your dad's gonna call you later, okay?"

579
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,740
Okay, I gotta go. Big event here on campus.

580
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,033
"- Exciting."
- I know.

581
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,743
"- Love you!"
- I love you too.

582
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,204
- Bye, mom!
"- Bye."

583
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,332
Thank you.

584
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,626
Aww... You're welcome.

585
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,421
All right. You okay?

586
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,091
Okay, come on.

587
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:09,936
Openness is something
we advocate here at The Circle.

588
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,437
We live it.

589
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:15,108
We demonstrate our commitment
to openness every day.

590
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,779
Our government, not so much.

591
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,908
We expect openness,
and we get obfuscation.

592
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,785
We get doublespeak.

593
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:31,374
I mean, no wonder congress's
approval rating is currently at 11%.

594
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,087
Now, I'm sure a lot of you have heard
about a certain senator

595
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,465
who, it was revealed,
has been involved in some...

596
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,343
Very unsavory business.

597
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,929
What are we to learn from this?

598
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,723
We need accountability.

599
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,809
We need openness.

600
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,563
We need to know
what the people who represent us

601
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,442
are doing with their time on our dime...

602
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,196
...To serve us better.

603
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,865
Well, I'm happy to report there is a woman

604
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,660
who is taking all of this very seriously,

605
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:13,166
and is taking some pretty dramatic steps
to address the problem.

606
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,795
So, please join me
in welcoming Olivia Santos,

607
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,756
congresswoman for district 14.

608
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,387
That's right, Tom.

609
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,141
I am as concerned as you are
about the need for citizens to know

610
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,102
what their elected leaders are doing!

611
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:39,609
So I intend to show exactly
how democracy can and should be.

612
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,865
Starting today,

613
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,575
my every meeting,

614
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,703
my every phone call and Email

615
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,457
will be accessible to my constituents

616
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,751
and to the world...

617
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
In real time!

618
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:07,095
It will all be on my Trueyou page.
That's right. Thank you!

619
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,722
- Thank you!
- Goodbye, back-room deals.

620
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,432
Goodbye, shady lobbyists.

621
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,520
Hello, democracy! Open and accountable!

622
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,522
That's right, that's a fact.

623
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,942
I'm thrilled to...

624
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,652
I work in customer experience.

625
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,446
I started in CE, too. A lot of us did.

626
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,865
Cool. Where do you work now?

627
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,868
Biometrics. Iris scanning,
facial recognition.

628
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,870
Right now I'm working on child track.

629
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,416
The program protects
children from predators.

630
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,543
The second, a kid isn't where
he's supposed to be,

631
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,754
an alert goes off, and the kid can be
tracked down within 90 seconds.

632
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,382
Wow! Do they wear a bracelet, or...

633
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,883
We place chips in the bone.

634
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,723
You're...

635
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,268
You're serious.

636
00:39:55,351 --> 00:40:01,482
I'm serious about immediately reducing
kidnapping, rape, and murder by 99%.

637
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,071
I think I'm gonna get a drink, but...

638
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,531
- Oh.
- It was nice to meet you.

639
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,907
Nice to meet you.

640
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,249
- Hey!
- Hey, check your Email,

641
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,419
- 'cause I sent you an invite.
- Awesome. Thank you.

642
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,088
- I'll see you.
- All right. You too.

643
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,258
- Hi, Mae, how's it going?
- Hey! You having fun?

644
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,343
Yeah.

645
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,336
"- Hey.
- Hey."

646
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,426
So, what did you think about
the whole presentation?

647
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,470
- The Santos thing?
- Yeah.

648
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:18,768
It's exciting. It's... A momentous moment
in the history...

649
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,104
Okay, what did you really think?

650
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,902
I thought it was a bit much.

651
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,445
Just a little bit.

652
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,574
So, where's all the data go?

653
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,743
Is it stored somewhere?

654
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,994
In the cloud...

655
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,414
There's a physical place, too.

656
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,377
Do you want to see something?

657
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,944
So, you're gonna have to leave
your stuff outside before we go in.

658
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,738
It's just because you're not supposed to,
you know...

659
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:23,291
So, I'm just gonna have
to take this and this.

660
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,096
I want to thank you already for this.

661
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,891
I love following strangers
down dark corridors.

662
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,810
- This is the best.
- Almost there.

663
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:54,447
This holds congresswoman Santos,
every second of her, from now on.

664
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,075
And this will be the next one.

665
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,955
- Just these?
- Oh, no. There's more.

666
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,710
What is this?

667
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:12,089
Oh, it's supposed to be a part
of the subway, but they abandoned it.

668
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,717
- Where does it go?
- It connects to the bay,

669
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,845
but I've traveled
about a half a mile into it.

670
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,388
Gets too wet.

671
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,810
And that's where the rest of it will be.

672
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,065
- Rest of what?
- The rest of it all.

673
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,653
Santos is just the start.

674
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,906
The plan is everything recorded,
seen, broadcast,

675
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,993
all of it stored, analyzed,
available to The Circle in any way.

676
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,539
You did your health intake, right?

677
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,791
- Yeah.
- You see, right? Look.

678
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,211
Every step, every breath,
all of it, stored.

679
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,714
They can use it however they see fit.

680
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,383
We're being studied.

681
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,803
Everyone's data in The Circle
is being studied, monetized.

682
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,472
It is voluntary.

683
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,850
And isn't that the whole point,
having everything in one place?

684
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,312
I mean, that's Trueyou.

685
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,857
That's not why I invented Trueyou,
not even close.

686
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,235
Ty Lafitte invented Trueyou.

687
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,197
Yeah. I'm Ty.

688
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,742
No, you're not.

689
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,329
Ty Lafitte’s been off the grid for years.

690
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,458
Oh, my God.

691
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm Ty.

692
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,588
Why the low profile?

693
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,841
I just wanted to move through this world
like a normal person.

694
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,926
I didn't want to be watched every second.

695
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,554
I do spend a lot of time here.

696
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,390
It's easier. I don't have to deal
with Stenton and Bailey,

697
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:49,103
not that I'm privy to their conversations
in their little sanctum.

698
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,479
Holy shit!

699
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,691
I'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte.

700
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,776
Now, hold on.

701
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,155
So, when we met,
you didn't know who I was?

702
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,575
You never told me your name,

703
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,869
and after a while,
it was just weird to ask.

704
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,206
I knew I could trust you when I met you.

705
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,916
I don't know, I just thought to myself,

706
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,154
«this girl, she doesn't have
a cynical bone in her body.»

707
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,464
Reminds me of how I used to be.

708
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,759
Listen, you can't tell anyone
that you were here, okay?

709
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,970
- That I brought you here.
- Okay.

710
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,974
Things at The Circle...
They need to change.

711
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:32,813
Like what, connecting the world?
Insuring my parents?

712
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,232
You should be really proud
of what you created.

713
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,568
No, proud? Proud of what?

714
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,445
The disregard for privacy?

715
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:43,407
The use of personal data for
the accumulation of wealth and control?

716
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,409
I'm not proud. This is not what I created.

717
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,953
Do you think Senator Williamson
being investigated by the FBI

718
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,080
is just a coincidence?

719
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,374
We can't be seen together,
and you have to promise me,

720
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,150
you can't tell anyone
that we were down here.

721
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,516
Hello?

722
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,559
"Mae, you have a visitor here to see you."

723
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,061
In the lobby?

724
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,944
- Hey!
- Hey! I...

725
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:24,031
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm really not okay.

726
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,950
Why didn't you call, send a text?

727
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,162
Because I wanted to see you in person.
I wanted to look you in the eyes.

728
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,623
Okay..-

729
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,750
um, I'll sign you in.

730
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,837
No, just... Wait. I...

731
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,005
The stuff you posted about my work.

732
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,549
Your chandeliers?

733
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,177
Yeah. I know you meant well, but...

734
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,972
What's the problem?
I thought I saw good stuff going on.

735
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,974
They started calling me a «deer killer».

736
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:54,812
And then there's a campaign
to shut me down. I wasn't even online.

737
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,314
I was working,
and when I checked my Email,

738
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,941
there were death threats.

739
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,656
- I'm sorry.
- Death threats, Mae.

740
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,201
Obviously, I never meant
for this to happen, but I... I can fix it.

741
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,792
Mae... Mae!

742
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,504
Will you listen to me?

743
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,672
I can't do this.

744
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,842
I can't be a part of this world
that you're creating.

745
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,469
What are you talking about?

746
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:30,347
Jesus Christ, look at these people!
Does this really seem okay to you?

747
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,137
Why don't you go kill
some more deer, Mercer?

748
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,350
I never killed any deer!

749
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,520
- I don't kill deer!
- Mercer, look.

750
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,147
Let's not do this here.

751
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,732
Let's go upstairs.

752
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,486
- I'll figure it outwith you.
- Do you ever leave this place, Mae?

753
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:48,032
We used to go on adventures,
and have fun, and see things,

754
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,827
and you were brave and excited.

755
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:55,164
And now it's all filtered through this.

756
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,338
Bye.

757
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,777
I can't believe I was so stupid.

758
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,779
I'm so lucky you guys were around here.

759
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,574
Luck? Hell, SeeChange cameras
saved your life.

760
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,618
The cop saw you go through the fence,

761
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,745
and then we got a call
from someone watching seals.

762
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,212
So, Mae, how do you feel?

763
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,970
Ashamed. I... I barely slept.

764
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,931
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.
We all are.

765
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,226
And everyone who watched
your adventure online.

766
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:49,189
- I hope your folks weren't too worried.
- They're doing okay.

767
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,484
I understand your father's
condition has improved.

768
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,153
Very much.

769
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,575
Mr. Bailey...

770
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,911
I want to say how much
I value my position here...

771
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,623
And what you've done for my family.

772
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,044
Mae, you're a valued part of The Circle,
and of your family.

773
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,839
And we care about everybody
you care about.

774
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,718
You know, this incident has actually shown
a lot of people

775
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,094
the necessity for Seechange.

776
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,431
I'm so glad those cameras were there.

777
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,609
Well, I wish you would've known
there was a camera there

778
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,789
before you swiped that kayak, but...

779
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:32,608
Mae, Tom and I want to talk to you
about an idea, but before we do...

780
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,528
Is there anything you want to tell us?

781
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,410
That I've been here before?

782
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:47,790
It's only our lies that get us in trouble,
the things we hide.

783
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,417
Of course, I know you've
been in here before.

784
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,172
And now that I know your secret,
do you feel better or worse?

785
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,428
Better.

786
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,722
Relieved, actually.

787
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:08,060
I am a believer in the perfectibility
of human beings.

788
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:12,147
When we are our best selves,
the possibilities are endless.

789
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,274
There isn't a problem
that we cannot solve.

790
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:18,070
We can cure any disease,
and we can end hunger, and...

791
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,198
Without secrets,

792
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,409
without the hoarding of knowledge
and information,

793
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,954
we can finally realize our potential.

794
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,543
"This is a special dream Friday."

795
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,419
"I thought I'd change it up a bit today"

796
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,799
"and not have a speech, but an interview."

797
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,343
"I had a conversation with a young Circler
the other day"

798
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,220
"that I wanted to share with you."

799
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:47,224
"I've asked Mae Holland,
who some of you might know"

800
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,309
"is one of our new guppies
in customer experience,"

801
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,686
"to join me today."

802
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,065
"Mae's only been with us for a few months,
but she has made quite an impression."

803
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,526
"Let's bring her out. Mae Holland!"

804
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,329
Well, hi, Mae, how are you?

805
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,998
Terrified.

806
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,375
- Don't be nervous.
- Easy for you to say.

807
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,002
Right.

808
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,173
All right. Mae, we have all seen the
SeeChange footage from the other night,

809
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,341
but please describe what happened for us.

810
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,095
I committed a crime.

811
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,599
I borrowed a kayak
without the owner's knowledge,

812
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,810
paddled out to the middle of the bay...

813
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,479
And I wasn't wearing a life jacket.

814
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:39,484
Well, I'm not sure that's exactly
a capital offense,

815
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,945
but you did risk your own life.

816
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:46,992
So, Mae, do you think you behave better
or worse when you are being watched?

817
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,246
Better. Without a doubt.

818
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,917
What happens when you're alone
and unobserved?

819
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,961
Well, for starters, I steal kayaks.

820
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,547
Jesus. She's a natural.

821
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:05,761
Seriously, I... Do things
I don't wanna do.

822
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,387
I lie.

823
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,610
When we spoke the other day,
you had a way of putting it

824
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,467
that I thought was very interesting
and succinct.

825
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,732
Could you tell us all what you said?

826
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,147
I said that secrets are lies.

827
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,733
Secrets are lies.

828
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,111
Go on.

829
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:28,283
Secrets are what make crimes possible.

830
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:31,703
We behave worse
when we're not accountable.

831
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,123
I was my worst self

832
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,252
because I didn't think
anyone was watching.

833
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,338
I thought...

834
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,966
That I was alone.

835
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,387
So, what did you see
on this kayaking trip, Mae?

836
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,596
Was it beautiful?

837
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,932
It was.

838
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,017
There was almost a full moon,

839
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,688
and it felt like...

840
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,275
Felt like I was paddling
through liquid silver.

841
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,112
Mm. It sounds incredible.

842
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,697
But there's no record of any of it.

843
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,241
- Not outside my own memory.
- Hmm.

844
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:16,164
Okay. So, now here we get
into something personal.

845
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:21,128
As you know, I have a son, Gunnar,

846
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,588
who was born with cerebral palsy.

847
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,174
And though he's living a very full life

848
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,802
and we're always trying
to improve his opportunities,

849
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,139
he is confined to a wheelchair.

850
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,475
And he-he can't walk,

851
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,519
he can't run,

852
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:40,063
he can't go kayaking.

853
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:44,401
So what does he do if he wants
to experience something like that?

854
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:49,156
Well, he watches video.
He looks at pictures.

855
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,033
And much of his experiences of the world

856
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,493
come through the experience of others.

857
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,205
When he experiences the view
of a circler climbing mount Kenya,

858
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:01,168
he feels like he's climbed mount Kenya.

859
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,088
When he sees first-hand video
from an America's cup crew member,

860
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:09,760
he feels, in some way,
that he's sailed in the America's cup too.

861
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,722
And these experiences
were facilitated by generous humans

862
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,767
who shared what they saw with the world,
my son included,

863
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,394
and there are many others out there
that are just like Gunnar.

864
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:23,732
Now, does it feel right to have deprived
them of seeing what you saw, Mae?

865
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,570
It doesn't.

866
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,783
It feels very wrong.

867
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,080
It was selfish.

868
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:44,127
When you deprive others of experiences
like the ones I had...

869
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,050
You're essentially stealing from them.

870
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,388
Knowledge is a basic human right.

871
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:03,397
Access to all possible human experience
is a basic human right.

872
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,910
Tell 'em, Mae!

873
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,955
Thank you, Mae, for your candor
and your consummate humanity.

874
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,290
Now... Now the best part.

875
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,252
In the interest of sharing everything
she can with the world,

876
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,838
Mae has... Mae has some news.

877
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,801
From now on...

878
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,473
I'll be wearing a modified
SeeChange camera...

879
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,268
At all times.

880
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,981
I'm going fully transparent.

881
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,194
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.

882
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,241
I'm gonna be starting immediately.

883
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,035
That's right!

884
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,957
Mae will be the first Circler to share
every single second of her work

885
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,126
and her personal life with the public,

886
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,628
so let's give her an even bigger hand!

887
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,106
Mae! Mae! Mae!

888
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,171
- Hello.
- Good morning, everyone.

889
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,175
Sun is shining, and I definitely
need my coffee.

890
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,387
We are in my third week of transparency,

891
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,223
and we're up to...

892
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:06,603
2,308,007 viewers. Wow.

893
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,772
Did I tell you guys
I'm not a morning person?

894
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:15,320
Okay. Among all of those viewers are...

895
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,907
"- I don't even know..."
- Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

896
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,492
"- Hi!
- Hi, Mae."

897
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,077
Say hello to everyone.

898
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,704
"- Hello, Circle!
- Hello, Circle!"

899
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,581
Look! We match.

900
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,750
"- Yeah.
- We sure do."

901
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,503
"- These are great.
- Very stylish."

902
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,755
I love you guys. I'll see you later.

903
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,174
"- Love you! Bye!
- I love you too, sweetheart."

904
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:44,849
- Hello, Circlers.
"- Hi, Mae."

905
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:48,270
So, this is where I worked
when I first arrived at The Circle,

906
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,356
and this is where I still work
at The Circle,

907
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,818
because even though I have you guys
looking over my shoulder,

908
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,404
I'm still basically a guppy.

909
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,826
Do it! Do it! Do it!

910
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,870
Oh, my God!

911
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,081
Tell her own story.

912
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,083
Stop looking that ashamed!

913
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,085
All right, that's our scene.

914
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,716
Okay. So, next up,

915
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:22,637
we just need the name of a person
who is historically significant.

916
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,556
Mae Holland!

917
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,683
Oh, my God, shh!

918
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,268
Sorry, we don't know who that is.

919
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,228
She is nobody, trust me.

920
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,483
Home sweet home.

921
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,861
Speaking of which,
let's check in with the folks.

922
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,407
Hey, where are you guys?

923
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,456
"- Yeah.
- There. There you go."

924
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,458
Whoa! Aah!

925
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,668
"- Keep going.
- Urn! Shit."

926
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,211
I hope the engineers are watching,

927
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,589
because that definitely
shouldn't have happened,

928
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,467
and it definitely won't happen again.

929
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,636
You can trust me there.

930
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,315
This is me brushing my teeth.

931
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,359
If you're enjoying this,
I'm worried about you.

932
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,877
Good night, everyone.

933
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,255
I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day,

934
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,926
but I'm happy I had you with me,
each and every one of you.

935
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,811
Never a boring day here.

936
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,314
A lot of you guys have been
asking me about this sculpture,

937
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,649
which is a treat for me.

938
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,068
I finally get to use
my art history degree.

939
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,028
This was made by an artist

940
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,740
who's frequently been in trouble
in his own country.

941
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:51,161
I want to thank all the watchers
who sent frowns to the government there,

942
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,164
both for their persecution of the artist,

943
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,083
and for their restriction
on Internet freedoms.

944
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:01,379
We have sent 180 million frowns
from the us alone.

945
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,258
You can bet that's gonna have
an effect on the regime.

946
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,428
Annie!

947
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,682
Annie!

948
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,768
Annie!

949
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,063
Annie!

950
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,530
Annie!

951
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,992
Annie Allerton!

952
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,590
Are we alone?

953
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,052
I have three minutes to use the bathroom
without the video on.

954
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,597
Ugh. Pervert.

955
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,848
How are you?

956
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,103
- Good.
- Well, you should be good.

957
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,980
You're killing it.

958
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,357
Do you think?

959
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,276
Oh, come on, false modesty won't work
here. You should be psyched!

960
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,072
Yeah. I am.

961
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,740
You're a meteor. It's insane.

962
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:14,702
People are coming to me
trying to get to you. It's crazy.

963
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:19,541
How are you really, Annie? You look wiped.

964
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,167
Thanks, Mae.

965
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,350
You know how much I like to be told right
after I appear in front of your millions

966
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,154
that I look terrible.
Thank you. You're sweet.

967
01:05:27,165 --> 01:05:29,334
Let me take you for dinner.

968
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,428
You gotta eat sometime.

969
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,264
With your camera
and me looking so terrible,

970
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,015
that sounds fantastic, but no.

971
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,685
I just... I'm... I'm worried about you.

972
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,396
- You're working too hard.
- You're worried about me?

973
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,439
You're... I'm worried about the E.U.,

974
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,227
but it's good to know
you're worried about me.

975
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,861
- I didn't mean it in that way.
- Don't worry in any way.

976
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,865
I know you can handle it.

977
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,741
Oh, thank you, Mae!

978
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,369
Your confidence in me will be the wind
beneath my wings.

979
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,414
How are your parents?

980
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,210
Sorry.

981
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,465
They're over that little... Episode?

982
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,847
I haven't heard from them, actually.

983
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,517
Guess it'll just take some time.

984
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,562
Sorry, Mae. Shit.

985
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:29,527
I'm fried... And I have to pull
another all-nighter.

986
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,239
Stenton is on my ass all the time.

987
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:37,243
I shouldn't have questioned him
about that whole senator Williamson thing.

988
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:42,582
And then... There's all
the new work on completion...

989
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,792
But I assume Bailey told you about that.

990
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:50,465
- Of course.
- Of course.

991
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,967
I'll be there at the concept kingdom
meeting tomorrow.

992
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,052
What?

993
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,230
There's a concept kingdom meeting...

994
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,890
I know what it is, but you're going?

995
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,851
Yeah. Bailey said I should be there.

996
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,770
And broadcast it?

997
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,272
Is that a problem?

998
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,859
No, I'm just surprised, that's all.
Those meetings are sensitive.

999
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,654
You know, maybe he's planning on having
you attend just the beginning.

1000
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,323
Mae, you're in over your head.

1001
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,452
Are you leaving?

1002
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,787
Yeah.

1003
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,707
I'm really so far behind on everything,
I could just die.

1004
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,046
Annie?

1005
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,091
Hello.

1006
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:35,760
See you.

1007
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:50,316
"So, here's how many people voted
in the last national election."

1008
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,319
"Here's how many were eligible to vote."

1009
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,992
And here's how many Americans
are registered in The Circle.

1010
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,162
And there's that guy.

1011
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,373
So, now we get down to the meat
of today's session,

1012
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,210
something we've discussed with
congresswoman Santos and others...

1013
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:14,132
What if your circle profile

1014
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,592
automatically registered you to vote?

1015
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,054
With Trueyou,
in order to set up the profile,

1016
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,640
you have to be a real person
with a real address,

1017
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:26,853
the complete personal info,
real social security number,

1018
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,821
with all the information
that the government wants

1019
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,024
when you register to vote.

1020
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,194
So, why wouldn't the state
consider you already registered

1021
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,321
when you open a circle account?

1022
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,657
There's no reason!

1023
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:44,454
We've got verbal commitments
from governors of almost every state,

1024
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:49,417
and they've agreed to push for legislation
that would make your circle account

1025
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,378
an automatic path to voter registration.

1026
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,803
I think it's a great idea.

1027
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,478
Well, yes, Mae?

1028
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,567
Why couldn't we take it one step further?

1029
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,944
I mean, I...

1030
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:20,406
I don't have
it completely figured out yet...

1031
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,106
No, no, no, no. Go on.
Go on. Go on. Go on.

1032
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,576
You started really well there.

1033
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,704
I like those words, «one step further».
It's how the company was built.

1034
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:33,002
Okay. Working backwards from your goal...

1035
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,545
Go on.

1036
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,548
...We all agree 100% participation
is what we like.

1037
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,218
100% participation is the ideal.

1038
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,845
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.

1039
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:48,935
And we already have 83% of voting-age
Americans registered to The Circle.

1040
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,603
Yep.

1041
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,649
And it seems we're on our way
to users being able to register,

1042
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,027
and maybe actually vote
through their Circle account...

1043
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:02,657
Well, that's a small leap,
but yes. Okay. Go on.

1044
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,829
Why not require every voting-age citizen

1045
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,914
to have a Circle account?

1046
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,917
Let her finish. Let her finish.

1047
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,295
Okay, I know the initial reaction
will be resistance.

1048
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:20,508
I mean, how can we require anyone
to use our services?

1049
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:24,137
But there are all kinds of things that are
mandatory for citizens of this country.

1050
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,844
We have to pay taxes we don't want to pay,

1051
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,682
and we have to pay for social security.

1052
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,267
We have to serve on juries.

1053
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,937
Right, and we have to pee indoors,
not on the street.

1054
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,647
We do, we do have to pee indoors.

1055
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,608
- She's right.
- I mean, we have thousands of laws.

1056
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,653
We require citizens
to do hundreds of things,

1057
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,573
but we don't require them to vote?

1058
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,077
They're already doing this
in dozens of countries.

1059
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:53,457
With the technology we already have,
users will already be registered.

1060
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:58,546
That means you have 241 million voters
eligible to vote.

1061
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:03,259
You have 241 million voters
that have to vote.

1062
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,763
You have the full will of the nation.

1063
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,724
And how exactly do we do that?

1064
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,684
Annie.

1065
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,980
Well, you know, it could be something
as simple as a zing.

1066
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:20,693
«Hey, Annie, remember
to take five minutes and vote.»

1067
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,820
That's what we would do
with our own surveys.

1068
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,447
You know that.

1069
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,825
But, Mae, what about stragglers?

1070
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,203
We all pay taxes...

1071
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,164
And, what, 80% of us
did that online last year?

1072
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,586
Why not stop duplicating services?

1073
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:42,381
Why not just make it all part
of one unified system?

1074
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:48,012
You could pay your taxes, vote,
pay your parking ticket,

1075
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,306
all through your circle account.

1076
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,059
We'd save users hundreds of hours
of inconvenience.

1077
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,894
We'd save the government billions.

1078
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,270
Hundreds of billions.

1079
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,731
We could eliminate half of it overnight.

1080
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,025
Why wouldn't the government
just build a similar service?

1081
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,276
Why the hell do they need us?

1082
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,781
It would cost too much.

1083
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,867
They don't have the expertise.
We already have the infrastructure.

1084
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,285
You are absolutely right.

1085
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,665
The government needs us
more than we need them.

1086
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:20,544
Imagine having the full will
of the people...

1087
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,214
Instantly.

1088
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:29,136
You'd have true democracy

1089
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,348
for the first time in human history.

1090
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,142
This is such bullshit.

1091
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,150
No voter suppression.
You're voting from home!

1092
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,903
Think of the implications
for totalitarian regimes.

1093
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,655
No more rigged elections.

1094
01:12:47,665 --> 01:12:49,776
The un can demand that
they're held through The Circle.

1095
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,409
But only if everyone is heard.

1096
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,785
Absolutely.

1097
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,204
Every human on earth.

1098
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,707
We can take the pulse of the nation.

1099
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,294
Everyone in the world in seconds
on any subject.

1100
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,920
It's the only way, right?

1101
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,922
- Right!
- Yeah!

1102
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,554
So, it looks like
I've got 20 minutes here.

1103
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,431
Let's try mom and dad.

1104
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,685
It's totally cool, man, Saturday night.
Get you in on it.

1105
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,687
- Hey, Mae, what's up?
- Hi.

1106
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,938
- Hey, Sid...
- Yeah?

1107
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:28,154
- Hey, where've you been?
"- Mae."

1108
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,407
I've seen your cameras aren't working.
I can send tech out...

1109
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,826
"Yeah. Yeah, we disconnected them."

1110
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,329
"Sweetheart..."

1111
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,832
"We're sorry, but we can't keep
doing this."

1112
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,669
"It's... It's more than we ever..."

1113
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:47,173
"you know, we love you
and we don't want to..."

1114
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:51,510
"- Love you, love you...
- We have to have our privacy."

1115
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:55,139
"And we're worried you don't realize
what you've gotten yourself into."

1116
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:58,517
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

1117
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,019
"- It's not you.
- Oh, we know that."

1118
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,382
"- It's us, we...
- Yeah, it's us."

1119
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,980
"...Just need you to understand that."

1120
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,778
- I love you.
"- We love you too."

1121
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,321
"Bye, honey."

1122
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,784
"You're the one, Mae!"

1123
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,494
"You're changing the world, Mae!"

1124
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,637
"- Mae, we love you!
- We love you!"

1125
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,138
Hello, everyone.

1126
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,350
I'm Mae Holland.

1127
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:49,318
Okay. We've had some good weeks
thinking about completion,

1128
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,947
envisioning a day
when everyone is in The Circle,

1129
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:57,868
when all of humanity
is connected and united,

1130
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,370
and it will happen.

1131
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:02,248
Already, 22 nations have agreed
in principle

1132
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,501
to operate their elections through
The Circle,

1133
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:10,673
with mandatory participation
from all of its citizens.

1134
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,180
When everyone is united,

1135
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:23,018
everyone is known, heard, accountable,

1136
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,104
they can be better served.

1137
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:29,358
But what about the people
who aren't part of The Circle,

1138
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:32,820
who don't want to be woven
into the fabric of society,

1139
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:36,866
or worse, want to tear at that fabric?

1140
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:41,537
I want to introduce SoulSearch,

1141
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:46,125
and we're putting it to the test
in front of the entire circle audience,

1142
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,003
here and globally.

1143
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,588
Do you feel ready?

1144
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,214
"Hell, yeah!"

1145
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,384
"Lined it up so far. Great."

1146
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:00,639
In seconds, the computer
will select at random

1147
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,933
a fugitive from justice,

1148
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:07,605
a proven menace to our global community.

1149
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,483
Our assertion is that whoever he or she is,

1150
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:15,279
SoulSearch will locate them
in under 20 minutes.

1151
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,072
"Wow."

1152
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,077
Let's select that fugitive.

1153
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,625
Okay. This is Fiona Highbridge,

1154
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,753
44 years old, born in Manchester, England.

1155
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:34,632
She was convicted
of triple murder in 2004.

1156
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,551
She locked her three children
in the closet

1157
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,179
and went on holiday to Spain.

1158
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:43,849
They all starved.

1159
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,311
She was sent to prison in England,

1160
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:52,316
but escaped with the help of a guard
who she apparently seduced.

1161
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:56,695
Over a billion people are watching.

1162
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:00,449
Let's see how many are in the U.K..

1163
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,452
Do you all think 14 million Brits

1164
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,247
and a billion global participants worldwide

1165
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,542
can find Fiona Highbridge
in under 20 minutes'?

1166
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,626
"Yeah!"

1167
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,883
All right. Let's bring up the clock.

1168
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,678
Good.

1169
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,179
Is everyone ready?

1170
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,435
On your mark, get set...

1171
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:30,437
Go!

1172
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,614
Okay. Time to get serious.

1173
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:13,772
"I've got her, Mae. That's her."

1174
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,233
Be careful.

1175
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,818
"I will."

1176
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:41,634
"Fiona, don't!"

1177
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,219
- Follow her!
"- Stop her!"

1178
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,764
"Somebody stop her! She's a killer!"

1179
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,726
"Stop her! Somebody stop her!"

1180
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,896
"- Go!
- Grab her!"

1181
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,736
"Stop her! Somebody grab her!"

1182
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,655
"She must be kept safe."

1183
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,073
Keep her safe.

1184
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,616
"Fiona..."

1185
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,286
"Well done!"

1186
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,665
"Are you a kid killer, eh?"

1187
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,921
"- You can't get away, killer!"
"- No, no, no!"

1188
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,047
"Oi, watch it."

1189
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,720
Stop the clock.

1190
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,724
"SoulSearch, baby!"

1191
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:31,934
I guess that's it!

1192
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,310
"SoulSearch, whoo!"

1193
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,816
"SoulSearch!"

1194
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,322
"Let's do another!"

1195
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,949
We could...

1196
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,785
"Maybe not a fugitive this time."

1197
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,829
"Let's try for a regular civilian."

1198
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:58,001
Okay, everyone, we're gonna
find a regular person.

1199
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:59,962
It can be anyone.

1200
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,091
A relative, a lost love.

1201
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:09,430
When everyone can be found,
we can never lose a friend.

1202
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,933
We can take a suggestion
from the audience.

1203
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,810
Uh, anyone?

1204
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,854
"Find Mercer!"

1205
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,025
I'm pretty sure
he doesn't want to be found.

1206
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,487
- Anyone else?
"- Where's Mercer?"

1207
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:29,575
"Mae, this is what SoulSearch is all about,
as well as completion."

1208
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,202
- Other suggestions?
"- Find Mercer!"

1209
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,163
"This is the whole point of SoulSearch,
Mae."

1210
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:37,040
- No.
"- Mercer! Mercer!"

1211
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,959
No, no, no, no.

1212
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,463
- No. I...
"- Mae, this is the right choice!"

1213
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,674
"Hey! Hey, everybody."

1214
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:50,429
Hey, I think it's time to reunite Mae
and Mercer, don't you?

1215
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,640
All right, and through
the power of The Circle,

1216
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,101
let's bring them back together again, okay?

1217
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,479
The perfect use of SoulSearch.

1218
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,897
Let's find your friend.

1219
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,151
"Go, Mae, now."

1220
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,078
Okay.

1221
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:25,631
So, our second SoulSearch today
involves not a fugitive from justice,

1222
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,300
but you might say a fugitive from, um...

1223
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,137
Well, friendship.

1224
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,687
This is my friend Mercer.

1225
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,482
Haven't seen him in a while.

1226
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,944
I'd love to see him again.

1227
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:51,698
Like Fiona, though, he's someone
who's trying not to be found,

1228
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:55,786
but unlike Fiona, he's not a criminal.

1229
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,037
He's good people.

1230
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,672
Let's see if we can break
our previous record.

1231
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,825
"Can't believe... I can't believe that!
Yes!"

1232
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,371
"There. Do you think he's in here?"

1233
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,292
"- Mercer!
- Mercer!"

1234
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,668
"Mercer, are you in there?"

1235
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,296
"Are you in there, like, killing deer,
making chandeliers?"

1236
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,884
"Mercer, we know you're in there.
We see your truck, it's right here."

1237
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:54,929
"- I think he's in there.
- All right, just go around."

1238
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,849
"Mercer, come out!"

1239
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:01,310
Remember to be nice, okay?

1240
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,728
"Mercer, we know you're in there."

1241
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,897
You found where he is. You did it.

1242
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,231
I think we should leave.

1243
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,442
"No, Mae, stay on this."

1244
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,527
"You've got millions of people
enjoying this."

1245
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:13,196
"There he is. There he is. There he is."

1246
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,657
"We just actually found Mercer.
I cannot believe this."

1247
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,457
"There he is.
He's headed out the back way."

1248
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,043
"Leave me alone! Jesus Christ!"

1249
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:49,149
You're kidding me.

1250
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,031
Can someone please get me
audio on the camera?

1251
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,496
Mercer, Mercer, stop driving.
It's just me.

1252
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,206
Mercer, stop the truck.

1253
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,416
You're surrounded by friends.

1254
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,378
Will you turn the speaker up?

1255
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:14,466
Mercer! Can you hear me?

1256
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:17,135
Mercer, it's me.

1257
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,335
You're surrounded by friends.

1258
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:23,850
Mercer, stop!

1259
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,334
How you doing, sweetie?

1260
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,382
You've been in bed for three days.

1261
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,968
Come out in the garden
with me today, okay?

1262
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:01,555
I got some new snapdragons
that need to be planted.

1263
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,934
Okay? Honey.

1264
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,647
Oh, honey.

1265
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,109
Oh.

1266
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,778
Oh.

1267
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,333
"Mae."

1268
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,793
Where are you?

1269
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:39,129
"- Are we alone?"
- Yes.

1270
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,048
"- Are we?"
- Yes.

1271
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,928
How is it daytime where you are?

1272
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,890
Wait... You're in Scotland.

1273
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,267
"Yep, I went home. Can you see?"

1274
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:55,896
What happened?

1275
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,231
"What, beside almost od'ing
on speed and soylent?"

1276
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,609
"Well, I found out I'm allergic to wheat."

1277
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,781
"I'm... I don't know."

1278
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,408
"I guess I almost died."

1279
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:14,831
"Oh, come on, no, don't...
Don't make me cry, come on."

1280
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,583
"No! I'm not gonna cry anymore."

1281
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,795
You getting better there?

1282
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,173
"Yeah, I am."

1283
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:25,800
"I eat, I look out the window,"

1284
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,345
"I come out here, I think, I daydream."

1285
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,972
"Haven't done that in years."

1286
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,308
"I'm glad you called."

1287
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,229
I didn't want to lose you, too.

1288
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,982
"I know."

1289
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,319
"Listen, Mae, I'm really,
really sorry about Mercer."

1290
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:47,614
"I'm a shit friend.
I should've said something sooner."

1291
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,449
"I should've, and I'm sorry."

1292
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,327
"It's just so horrible."

1293
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:56,998
"Have they spoken to you about him?"

1294
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,458
Not yet.

1295
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,503
I'm going in tomorrow.

1296
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,839
"Uh-huh, they ask for forgiveness
and never for permission."

1297
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:07,050
"They have to go.
They've broken a hundred laws."

1298
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,261
"They've made me subvert
a thousand regulations."

1299
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,222
- There's gotta be a way to...
"- What?"

1300
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,057
"Stop people doing bad shit?"

1301
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,184
Well, yeah.

1302
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:20,605
"Do you need some time away here, too?
I've got an extra bed if you want it."

1303
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,611
This feels so good,

1304
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:31,032
just being with you, even like this.

1305
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:34,119
"Yeah. Yeah, I know..."

1306
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:38,832
This is gonna sound crazy,

1307
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:43,878
but I keep having this feeling
that Mercer would still be here

1308
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,255
if we hadn't lost touch.

1309
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,049
"No, come on, what were you
supposed to do? I mean..."

1310
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,010
"You know, he drifted away."

1311
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,720
"It happens."

1312
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,806
Yeah, but we had all this technology,
all this power.

1313
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,268
"Well, I mean, technology didn't
exactly help the situation."

1314
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:01,604
What if it could?

1315
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:12,198
Hey, your dad woke up at four
this morning and your light was still on.

1316
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:15,368
What were you doing in your room?
Were you on the phone?

1317
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:20,457
It helped. I have friends
all over the world.

1318
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:22,959
They care.

1319
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,377
Hmm.

1320
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,255
- I spoke to Annie.
- How is she?

1321
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:30,717
Good. Better.

1322
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,552
I realized how much I missed her.

1323
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,141
I have to go back.

1324
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,976
Go back where?

1325
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,688
Not to The Circle.

1326
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,815
The circle didn't kill Mercer, mom.

1327
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:49,903
It was a bad tool, a bad system. It...

1328
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,279
It can be fixed.

1329
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:56,618
We're not gonna become Amish, mom. I...

1330
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,580
When someone dies in a plane crash,
you don't abandon planes.

1331
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:03,958
- You make them safer.
- Mae-Mae, at least wait a bit.

1332
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,753
I'm the only one who can do this.

1333
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,463
I'm sorry.

1334
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:11,424
I love you.

1335
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,283
"- Hello?"
"- Hey, it's me."

1336
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:40,286
"Mae? How are you holding up?"

1337
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,371
"Better, actually."

1338
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,374
"I'm coming in to see them today,
but I need your help."

1339
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,127
"Yeah, sure, name it. Anything you need."

1340
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:18,741
"We were worried when we didn't
hear from you for so long."

1341
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,160
"We were very concerned."

1342
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:23,079
"No contact for four days,
your camera was off..."

1343
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:24,330
How are you doing?

1344
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,793
I'm okay.

1345
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:33,006
Tom and I've been talking about how little
we knew about this young man, Mercer,

1346
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,133
'cause he's someone
we should've been able to help.

1347
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:39,304
A fund should be established
for his family.

1348
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,098
Yeah, absolutely. It's done.

1349
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:46,728
Listen, Mae, we would like to offer you
a new role here at The Circle,

1350
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:51,733
with no formal obligation,
maybe a lighter schedule.

1351
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:54,444
You can choose your own projects
and you can think long-term.

1352
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,487
You could take pottery, if you wanted.

1353
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,031
I don't know if you're aware of this,

1354
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,450
but one of our founders, Ty Lafitte...

1355
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,493
- Yeah.
- ...Was given the same opportunity,

1356
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,955
and now he loves his freedom.

1357
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:09,959
And I don't know
if this is any consolation,

1358
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:13,296
but at our next dream Friday...

1359
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,423
We're going to imagine a world

1360
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:19,302
in which every disturbed young man
could be kept safe.

1361
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,263
Would you like to join us?

1362
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:26,517
I'm not sure I'm ready for that, but...

1363
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:30,521
Thanks for the invitation.

1364
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,856
Take your time.

1365
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,866
- Can't believe she's back.
- That's her.

1366
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:00,551
I did what you asked.
You won't believe the shit I found.

1367
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,679
It's worse than I could've imagined.

1368
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:05,556
And... And look, Mae, I'm so sorry.

1369
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,519
I never met him, but they should
build a monument to Mercer.

1370
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:13,231
- Yeah.
- I mean, this...

1371
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,441
This changes everything.

1372
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,944
Okay, he's the martyr who will
wake everyone up, right?

1373
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,821
I don't know what you're planning,

1374
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,198
but if you turn that camera back on,

1375
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,909
whatever you say about The Circle's
heard around the world,

1376
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,661
and it changes everything.

1377
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,428
Hello.

1378
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:47,974
Hello, again.

1379
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:54,939
- Hi.
- Hey, Mae.

1380
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,243
And that is how it should've been,
how it could've been,

1381
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,996
but we didn't have the technology...
But we will!

1382
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:14,751
And when we do, when every vehicle
is known and connected,

1383
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:18,171
the data we have will help us
improve traffic patterns,

1384
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,714
keep drivers safe,

1385
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:24,719
and optimize circle services
across all platforms.

1386
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:29,807
Shopping. Lodging. Attractions.

1387
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,226
Attractions like Mae Holland!

1388
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,270
Mae, come on out here!

1389
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,147
Come on out here! Gosh, Mae.

1390
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,566
Hey, you're transparent again.
Look at that!

1391
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:42,445
Hello! Hello. Mae Holland.

1392
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:45,531
"- Mae!
- We missed you!"

1393
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:51,079
Now... Mae is a brave person,

1394
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,247
because even amid her grieving,

1395
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:57,960
she knows that she has
a responsibility to her followers,

1396
01:35:58,044 --> 01:35:59,754
to the whole world, really.

1397
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,007
Thanks for saying that, Eamon.

1398
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:07,053
And I couldn't agree with you more.

1399
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:11,015
I know that Tom,
he agrees too, right, Tom?

1400
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,600
You want to come out?

1401
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:15,645
Come on.

1402
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:17,647
There you are.

1403
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:24,487
First, I wanna thank everyone here
and around the world

1404
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,949
for the support you've given me
since we lost Mercer.

1405
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,242
These past days,

1406
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:34,163
I've realized something about myself
and about The Circle.

1407
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:38,668
It's that I don't wanna be disconnected.

1408
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,797
I don't wanna have to search for friends,
family, my loved ones.

1409
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:46,676
We lost track of Mercer,

1410
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:50,388
but what if we never lost touch
with each other?

1411
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:56,227
What if instead of searching,
we always knew?

1412
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:03,734
What I am proposing is radical openness
and unbroken connection.

1413
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,695
Hmm.

1414
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,907
- It would have to start here.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1415
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,869
You know the usual hypocrisy
of the digital world.

1416
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:17,748
We want everything in the cloud
and yet our leaders...

1417
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,668
Live above it.

1418
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,504
So, I want to invite Eamon and Tom

1419
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:30,761
to join me in this experiment
that they have pioneered.

1420
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:37,810
I invite them to set an example
for The Circle and the world...

1421
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:42,482
To go transparent.

1422
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,197
What do you say, guys?

1423
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,908
Will you join me?

1424
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:03,044
Wouldn't it be great to know
their every move, their every word?

1425
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:07,465
From now on, every message,
meeting, phone call,

1426
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,718
all will be public, knowable.

1427
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,845
Never erased.

1428
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,847
In fact, Ty Lafitte has helped us

1429
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:19,393
make every document
in the company's history public,

1430
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:23,814
every message, every plan,
including, and this is my favorite part,

1431
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:28,736
every Email from Tom
and Eamon's accounts,

1432
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:30,404
and their private accounts,

1433
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,532
and their secondary confidential accounts,

1434
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:37,161
and even their super-secret
scrambled code accounts

1435
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:43,000
that nobody, not even their assistants
or wives, knew existed...

1436
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:45,670
Until now.

1437
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,633
It's all been sent to you already.

1438
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,180
We're so fucked.

1439
01:38:56,264 --> 01:39:00,476
I think we're entitled to that kind
of access, don't you?

1440
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,353
"Yeah!"

1441
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,275
Mae, you are
a very brave woman to do this.

1442
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,741
There are no more secrets.

1443
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,868
Privacy was a temporary thing...

1444
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:21,831
And now it's over.

1445
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:23,666
We won't live in the shadows anymore.

1446
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,753
Hey, good timing.

1447
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:48,316
Thank you.

1448
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:51,402
Thank you.

1449
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:53,613
I'm tired of hiding.

1450
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:58,034
These passwords and secret knocks,

1451
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:01,454
the difference between
public and private...

1452
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:03,998
Aren't you all?

1453
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:06,542
And come to think of it,

1454
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:09,211
I'm tired of standing here in the dark.

1455
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:12,548
Don't worry,

1456
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,301
Eamon will catch up or...

1457
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:16,886
Maybe he won't.

1458
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,764
Either way, it's time for a change.

1459
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:22,141
We're gonna remake this place.

1460
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:27,271
And if we do it right, we'll
set an example for everyone.

1461
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,523
The future won't wait.

1462
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:14,860
"Hello."
