1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,409
Yo, y'all remember that nigga
Daniel from 16th Street?

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,778
Yeah.
- Fucking tough-ass nigga Daniel, yo.

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,315
That's my fucking word.
I see that nigga in jail, right?

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,385
Within a fucking week they had the nigga
wearing a fucking wedding dress.

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,187
I'm serious...
and carrying a fucking Bible.

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,590
I thought... that's my fucking word.
I swear to fucking God.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,855
Like they fucking beat
his ass down mad fucking...

8
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,126
Fucking cocksucker-ass nigga.

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,401
So anyways, like I was telling you, right?
That's my word.

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,241
I fucking slapped that nigga's fucking face.

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,917
No.

12
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,830
Move it, before the flies lay eggs.

13
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,090
What the fuck are you looking at, boy?

14
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,795
Worse than my damn kids.

15
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,098
Man, that's fucked up.

16
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,910
Just shut up and pick 'em up,
sugar britches.

17
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,612
Bitch.

18
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,983
Motherfucker.

19
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,450
Why don't you turn up the frost?

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,155
They be getting hot back there.

21
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,586
Y'all cool now?

22
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,067
Fucking chillin', yeah.

23
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,347
...to endorse the emergency
bailout of Goldberg, Lesser...

24
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,851
...is claiming the Federal Bank
itself is on the verge of bankruptcy.

25
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,352
Fuck the banks, man.

26
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,223
G-man needs to give a serious
cash injection to this shithole.

27
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,091
That's what... that's what the fuck
needs to happen.

28
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,827
It's all about keeping
these monkeys in the zoo.

29
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,096
As long as their shit doesn't spill over...

30
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,099
...in their fancy backyards,
they could give a fuck.

31
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,736
Yeah, they pay us dumbasses
to clean up the fucking mess.

32
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,339
Damn right, brother.
And be thankful for the work.

33
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
Thankful my ass.

34
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,989
Make way for the man, fellows.

35
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,455
He got work to do.

36
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,593
Mm-hmm.
- We've been keeping him busy.

37
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,423
Shit. Yeah.

38
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,571
Listen, my friend,

39
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,768
I'll be seeing you later.

40
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,179
Yeah.

41
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,753
Fucking pussy.
See how he ran in there?

42
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,219
Shitting his pants.

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,795
City mayor slashed
the law enforcement budget...

44
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,766
...in the metropolitan area by 60%
as a last-ditch attempt...

45
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,968
...to stave off bankruptcy procedures.

46
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,970
This follows the closing...

47
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,172
...of an additional six inner-city schools...

48
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,842
...and the Greenborough Memorial Hospital.

49
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,553
Help. Help.

50
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,427
Oh hey, brother.
How's your day?

51
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,757
Fine.

52
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,665
I've got three in the back, execution,

53
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,467
covered with some pretty nasty shit.

54
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,567
Where's your porter?

55
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,204
Gone.

56
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,499
Jesus.

57
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,632
Where's the gurney?

58
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,882
Not here, please.

59
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,024
It was a pleasure, as always.

60
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,040
He gives me the fucking creeps, man.

61
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,276
He's a weird motherfucker, man.

62
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,181
You think he talks to the stiffs?

63
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,266
He's beautiful again.

64
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,827
It's as if he's reborn.

65
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,271
Thank you.

66
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,016
You have no conception of
how reconciled you've made me.

67
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,687
Shut the fuck up,
you little bastard.

68
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,194
Don't talk to him like that.

69
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,196
Then make him fucking stop.

70
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,565
Give him to me.
Give him to me.

71
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,665
He's your son.

72
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,969
She always had class.

73
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,302
She was a proud,

74
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,807
discrete woman.

75
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,375
She would do anything for you.

76
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,253
I tried to take care of you myself,

77
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,819
but the state intervened.

78
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,785
She would do anything for you.

79
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,708
What the fuck did you say to me?

80
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,159
I do trust...

81
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,891
...you'll enjoy your time here.

82
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,398
Yeah, excuse the stench.

83
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,402
We do everything we can here,

84
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,300
but summer's upon us.

85
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,606
Hi.

86
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,508
Well,

87
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,567
this fabulous young man is Noah.

88
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,547
He's your replacement porter.

89
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,651
He's been gifted to us
by the ever-so-well-meaning...

90
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,020
...offenders rehabilitation service...

91
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,789
...gang member,

92
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,792
multiple gun violations,
yada-yada-yada.

93
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,061
But due to his parole officer's...

94
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,527
...acute sense of irony,

95
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,899
he has to complete his probation...

96
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,958
...wheeling in bodies for your delectation.

97
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,938
Well, I guess you two...

98
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,804
...should get along fabulously.

99
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,080
You'll find a lab coat in the locker room.

100
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,249
And please make sure
your hands are scrubbed.

101
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,580
A'ight, bro.

102
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,033
Please place that in the garbage pail.

103
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,573
Please, could you stop that?
It disturbs me.

104
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,924
You need to relax, man.

105
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,720
So, yeah, what is it exactly

106
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,798
I gotta do around here?

107
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,237
When a delivery is made,
I would like for you...

108
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,573
...to bring the bodies
through here for processing.

109
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,575
I would also like for you...

110
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,012
...not to disrupt my concentration as I work.

111
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,247
Now if there's nothing else,

112
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,781
please let me pass.

113
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,919
Oh, yes sir.

114
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,324
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
You all right, bro?

115
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,023
She had to bring you up on her own.

116
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,377
She would do anything for you.

117
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,432
I tried to take care of you myself.

118
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,345
He's been crying all day.

119
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,690
Jesus, take care of him.
Can't you feed him something?

120
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,692
I ain't got nothing to give him.

121
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,560
Fuck. Shit.

122
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,080
You go get some food.
You're the big man around here.

123
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,024
Hey, sweetie, come up.
Get out of that rain.

124
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,124
Come on.

125
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,858
Oh, honey, you're soaked.

126
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,264
Poor baby.

127
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,236
Let's get you comfortable, honey.

128
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,336
Come on.

129
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,160
All right, honey,
just lay back.

130
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,094
Relax.
That's it.

131
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,190
Oh, honey,
you are always so cold.

132
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,327
You need some loving to warm you up.

133
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,274
...$137 million...

134
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,115
...from the metro public pension program.

135
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,215
This is the latest...

136
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,119
...in the series of corruption scandals...

137
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,121
...that has plagued the mayor's office.

138
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,221
The FBI...

139
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,175
Fasten your lab coat.

140
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,235
Yes sir, master sir.

141
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,574
I swear to God.

142
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,044
Fuck this bullshit.
I'll cut the motherfucker up.

143
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,564
Fucker. I'll fuck him up
for good this time, I swear.

144
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,389
How's about you keep your
eyes to yourself, man?

145
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,192
I mean there's a lot of shit
you don't need to know nothing about.

146
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,137
You feel me? So why don't you just
mind your own business?

147
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,035
Still locking that, huh?

148
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,191
You know anybody we want
in there, gets in there.

149
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,583
Say,

150
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,487
you seen a little kid...

151
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,587
...about yea high,

152
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,149
pretty like me?

153
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,560
No.

154
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,924
Are you sure about that?

155
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,494
Yes.
- Yes, you've seen him?

156
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,882
Or yes, you're sure you ain't seen him?

157
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,471
I haven't seen the boy.

158
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,611
Say you haven't.

159
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,308
Know this:

160
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:41,103
I've taken a liking to that boy.

161
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,381
So if you come across him,

162
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,324
you're obliged to tell me.

163
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,393
You get me?

164
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,060
That's it.
I'm out of here.

165
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,689
Hey kid, wait.

166
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,394
Wait.

167
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,897
This place gives me the creeps, man.

168
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,899
Yeah, well, you don't have to work here.

169
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,735
This is fucked up.

170
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,737
I'm telling you,
Carver ain't messing.

171
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,739
He wants the kid bad.
- Well, he ain't here.

172
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,341
Yeah, well, he's bound to
wind up here sooner or later.

173
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,945
Yo, my man, you seen the kid
around here, man?

174
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,014
What's his fucking problem?

175
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,579
The dude's straight up weird.

176
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
I want to come in.

177
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,165
It's not permitted.

178
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,265
Just let me in.

179
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,326
No, you're not allowed.

180
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,670
Please.

181
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,405
Why do you want to come in here anyway?

182
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,505
Just let me in.

183
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,108
I can't let you in.

184
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,081
Well, then fuck you.
Go on, fuck off.

185
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,248
Hey, kid, you need to calm down.

186
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,348
I hate you.

187
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,899
You're late.
- Yeah, I know.

188
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,667
All right, man,
so I'm late. Whatever.

189
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,252
I had some personal shit to take care of.

190
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,455
Delivery.

191
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,929
Porter?

192
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,179
Just get off me.

193
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,279
Porter.

194
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,692
The name's fucking Noah,
man, all right?

195
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:12,297
What was that all about?
- Mind your fucking business.

196
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,821
You have another 13 minutes
to work before you go.

197
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,856
What are you talking about, man?
It's 6:00.

198
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,259
You were 13 minutes late this morning.

199
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,359
You need to make it up.

200
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,263
Man, fuck that.
Man, I'm gone.

201
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,064
If you do not make up the time,

202
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,223
it will go reported.

203
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,825
With who?

204
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,902
Don't push me.

205
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,587
Whatever it is,
it can wait till tomorrow.

206
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,589
I'm over overtime, dude.

207
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,689
I'm over and out.

208
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,175
Come on, dude, just give me
the money, will you?

209
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,921
Where the fuck are you at, boy?

210
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,566
Mm-hmm.

211
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,545
Hey, man.

212
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,547
Good morning, Noah.

213
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,619
Here's where my joyful colleague...

214
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,989
...conducts his cheery work.

215
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Hey.

216
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,632
This is Noah's parole officer Mr. Clinger.

217
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,827
I've got stuff to do.

218
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:42,099
So how's my boy getting on?

219
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,574
Behaving himself?

220
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,838
He's been satisfactory.

221
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,912
Really?

222
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,246
That's a surprise.

223
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,452
See, this brother here thinks...

224
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,453
...he's something of a hard man,

225
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,522
a gangster.

226
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,890
Ain't that right, Noah?

227
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,861
He's been satisfactory...

228
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,191
...and performs his duties adequately.

229
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,521
Well, you just let me know
if he steps out of line...

230
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,108
...if he curses you under his breath,

231
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,699
gives you any lip,

232
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,245
if he's late...

233
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,313
...by a single minute.

234
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,451
Because it would be my
absolute pleasure...

235
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,221
...to send this horrible little delinquent...

236
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,590
...right back to where he belongs.

237
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,460
I personally would like to ensure...

238
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,858
...that he rots there.

239
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:42,349
So you have anything
to say for yourself, laddy buck?

240
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,867
Huh.

241
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,974
That's too bad,
because I was hoping...

242
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,809
...that you would tell me to go fuck myself.

243
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,003
Well, if you don't mind,
Mr. Clinger,

244
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,715
Noah and I have work to attend to.

245
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,840
Well, go ahead.

246
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,917
I'm done here...

247
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,919
...for now.

248
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,617
Bye-bye, Noah.

249
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,839
I'll be seeing you very soon, I hope.

250
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,699
I don't need you to fight
my fucking war for me.

251
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,256
Porter.

252
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,861
Porter.

253
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,402
Fucking trying to get away from me, Kane.

254
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,238
I'ma kick your fucking ass.
Fucking come here, come on.

255
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,240
I don't care.
- Stop fucking with me, man.

256
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,242
Don't fuck with me.
Come on.

257
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,892
No, I don't want to leave her.

258
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,519
Get off me.
- What are you gonna do, huh?

259
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,986
What the fuck are you gonna do? Walk.

260
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,958
Walk. I'ma rip your fucking arm...

261
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,960
...out of your fucking socket. Come on.

262
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Walk walk.

263
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,499
Fuck you're looking at, man?
Mind your fucking business.

264
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,568
Stop it.

265
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,635
You fucking punk.

266
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,273
I could kill you myself right now, right here.

267
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,705
Fucking walk.

268
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,678
Hurry up.
Get the fuck out here.

269
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,346
Stop fucking around, come on.

270
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,647
Jesus.
- No.

271
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,747
Get inside.

272
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,551
Hey, get the fuck inside.

273
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,922
What's happening, iceman?

274
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,138
You see that kid yet?

275
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,246
Are you sure about that?

276
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,468
You ain't sure or you ain't seen him?

277
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,674
I... I haven't seen the kid.

278
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,551
Shame.

279
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,658
You ought to be careful out here
this time of night.

280
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,627
There's a lot of ill-minded motherfuckers...

281
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,447
...just ready to violate a fool.

282
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,518
Hey.

283
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,835
Oh, honey, come up.
It's cold out there.

284
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,263
I want you to go back.

285
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,000
Roll over.
That's it.

286
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,736
That's it.

287
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,336
Just relax.

288
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,576
Mm-hmm. Okay.

289
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,585
Just relax.
You're so...

290
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,022
Jesus, baby, you've got knots...

291
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,647
...the size of baseballs.

292
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,955
Mm, there you go.

293
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,124
There you go.

294
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,169
Shh.

295
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,557
It's okay, honey.
You were just sleeping.

296
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,896
It's all right.

297
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,104
Thank you.

298
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,574
So long, honey.

299
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,823
I don't give a fuck who you lean on.

300
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,603
It's your obligation to find the kid.

301
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,763
I want the kid.

302
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,604
I ain't got the kid.

303
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,577
That irritates me.

304
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,114
Your incompetence...

305
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,378
...is an irritant.

306
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,750
I don't like to be irritated.

307
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,759
So find the fucking kid...

308
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,195
...and spare me the further irritation...

309
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,597
...of having to make an example of you.

310
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,858
You get me?

311
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,025
All right, come on,
get the fuck in here. Come on.

312
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,027
Get off me.
- Jesus Christ, get in there.

313
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,459
Come here.
You too, come on.

314
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,719
Yo, mister, you got a light?

315
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,122
No.
- You fucking say nothing.

316
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,891
You shut the fuck up.
- Get the fuck in here, man.

317
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,494
Stay the fuck still.
You're gonna stay the fuck right here,

318
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,763
or I'm gonna be the first one to make sure
you're back in that fucking mortuary...

319
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,498
...on a fucking slab, my nigga.

320
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,493
I'm freaking out, Noah.

321
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,569
I know. I know.

322
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,396
What are you doing here?

323
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,494
I was worried about you.

324
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:01,165
I was checking on you
to make sure you were okay.

325
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,927
So...

326
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,869
...are you okay?

327
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,529
I'm fine.

328
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,647
Thank you.

329
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,086
You know, you might want...

330
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,215
...to stop shrugging your shoulders.

331
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,092
You'll end up stooping like me.

332
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,704
Why have you been coming
to the mortuary?

333
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,414
I want to see my mama.

334
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,884
They won't let me see her.

335
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,241
What does your mama look like?

336
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,796
She's pretty.

337
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:15,362
She's got long dark hair
and big brown eyes.

338
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,442
She's got a little red ruby in her nose...

339
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,542
...and a tattoo...

340
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,172
...of some lady called Venus.

341
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,718
What's your name?

342
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,554
Kane.

343
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,324
Hello, Kane.

344
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:40,922
Would you like to sit down here...

345
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,899
...and tell me about your mama?

346
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,169
It's okay.

347
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,683
She smiles all the time,

348
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:07,383
even when she's sad.

349
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,260
She don't like me to know when she's sad.

350
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,262
So when I ask her why she's sad,

351
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,856
she just laughs and makes goofy jokes.

352
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,970
She sings me songs...

353
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,463
...when I go to sleep.

354
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,248
Sing me one of your mama's songs.

355
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,881
Can it be?

356
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,618
Do you hear?

357
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,891
A new freedom song

358
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,956
Is ringing

359
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:55,232
No more doubt

360
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,838
No more fear

361
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,280
There's a new song

362
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,979
That is ringing...

363
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,181
It's so far, it's so close

364
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,418
Almost near

365
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,689
Almost here.

366
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,862
You're freezing.

367
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,723
Wake up. I'm gonna
help you see your mama.

368
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,823
Come on.

369
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,354
What are you gonna do next?

370
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,534
Where the fuck is Kane?
Have you seen him?

371
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,634
Kane.

372
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,898
Kane. Kane.

373
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,598
Fucking shit.
Maria, they're fucking gone.

374
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,250
Okay.

375
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,350
Here here here.

376
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,944
Climb the wall.
Quick quick.

377
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,810
Motherfucker.

378
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,640
Fucking shit.

379
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,651
Here, cover your mouth.

380
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,722
Okay, let's go.

381
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,579
Argh.

382
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,987
Come here.
Get the fuck up.

383
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,056
Get over here.
Get over here. Come here.

384
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,957
Stop it.
Leave him alone.

385
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,959
Come here, my nigga.
Get the fuck over here.

386
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,429
Get the fuck down.
Fuck is wrong with you, man?

387
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,164
Leave him alone.
He's my friend.

388
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,598
Okay, I got you.
I got you. I got you.

389
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,534
Please don't hurt him.
He's only being nice.

390
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,769
You don't understand, all right?
Look, him being fucking nice...

391
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,404
...is gonna get us fucking killed.
- You understand that?

392
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,673
No.
- Get the fuck down, man.

393
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,941
Get the fuck down.

394
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,077
Come here, come here.
It's okay. Come here.

395
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,846
Maria, take him please.
Take him please.

396
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,315
You ain't going fucking nowhere.
- Noah, don't.

397
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,384
What the fuck, yo?
What the fuck?

398
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,782
Not in front of Kane.

399
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,923
What's going on, Noah?

400
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,093
Shit, mind your fucking
business, my nigga.

401
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,228
I swear to God,
mind your fucking business.

402
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,786
You made this my business.
- Excuse me?

403
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,669
If you don't tell me what's going on,
I'm taking Kane with me.

404
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,105
You're fucking going nowhere.
Get the fuck over here.

405
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,208
Get over here. I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- No. No.

406
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,677
What the fuck do you want from me, huh?

407
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,432
What the fuck more
do you guys want from me?

408
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,244
Noah, what's going on?

409
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,128
You have to tell me, Noah.

410
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,530
He's my fucking nephew,
dawg, all right?

411
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,793
Jenny Morales was my sister.

412
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,131
Carver thought he owned her.

413
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,480
Let me just check on him.

414
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,810
The kid's gonna have to learn to wait.

415
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,488
He's a sack of shit.

416
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,323
I swear I'm gonna give it to him
one day soon big time.

417
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,226
Listen, I don't like him.
He's an asshole. And he's a fool.

418
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,128
Why do you let him come in here then?

419
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,430
Why don't you just let him go
and stay out for good...

420
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,732
...instead of coming back up in here...

421
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,433
...and just jumping you
whenever he wants to?

422
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:31,935
Oh, grow up, Noah.

423
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,237
Having him come once
in a while to get some...

424
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,239
...is just enough to keep
the other hoodlums away.

425
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,643
It's bullshit.
- It's the way it is, so deal.

426
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,974
I'm gonna get us out of this place,

427
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,777
but until then,
it's just the way it is.

428
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:53,321
Can it be?

429
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,585
Do you hear?

430
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,427
Are you singing?

431
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,257
She was smarter than me.

432
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,232
She knew how things worked.

433
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,234
She knew what needed to be done.

434
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,603
I tried to protect them,
but I fucked up,

435
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,171
and I fucked up every fucking time.

436
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,266
I got sent upstate for
doing some stupid shit...

437
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,844
...enough stupid shit to land me
like a two-year bit.

438
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,069
What the fuck's going on?

439
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,882
He's been loaning her out to his crew.

440
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,117
Crew? Excuse me?
What does that mean?

441
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,053
Carver has been pimping
her out to his buddies.

442
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,955
Maria.
- I'm sorry.

443
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,055
She tried to leave,

444
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,049
so he beat her... look.

445
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,565
I can't even fucking deal
with this shit right now.

446
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,099
Where are you going?

447
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,703
Come on, let me go.

448
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,803
Oh God.

449
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,036
Hey.

450
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,876
You have to stay out of trouble.

451
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,761
I know.

452
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,934
Hey, kid.

453
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,628
You. You, come here.

454
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,411
You too, come here.

455
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,398
I couldn't bear to see her like that.

456
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,578
I knew I had to stand up
and take responsibility.

457
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,069
The prodigal son.

458
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,371
Sit down.

459
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,241
Be my guest.

460
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,255
You need to leave her alone.

461
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,335
She my baby mama.

462
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,270
I got rights.

463
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,973
No no, you ain't got no right
to raise your hands to her like that,

464
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,110
let alone let some other
niggas touch her, man.

465
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,413
You got balls coming here talking like that.

466
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,750
I'm telling you that you're a man, all right?

467
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:11,100
And I'm just asking you
to act like one. That's it.

468
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:29,198
You are asking me to act like a man?

469
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,976
No, dawg, I'm telling you to act like a man...

470
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,544
...and leave my sister alone.

471
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,883
Fuck that, Carver.

472
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,216
Whoo. Yeah. Ha.

473
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,347
That bitch going down.

474
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,386
Stop. Fucking stop.
Shit.

475
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,461
All right.

476
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,333
Brutal.

477
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,833
Carv, you fucked that bitch up for real.

478
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,311
Is that man enough for you?

479
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,851
Shh.

480
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,073
We need to get out of here.

481
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,374
I know someplace safe.

482
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,576
Hey, sweetie.

483
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,512
You can stay here as long as you need.

484
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,637
Carver won't look here.

485
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,547
I appreciate that.
- Thank you.

486
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,614
You'll be safe here for a while.

487
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,226
It was never meant to be like this.

488
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,863
I tried to step up and do right by my sister,

489
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,232
but each time it fell apart,

490
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,392
leaving Jenny to pick up the pieces.

491
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,234
You get to load it when you pay.

492
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,978
All right, that's 150, right?

493
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,746
Come on.

494
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,415
It should be 170,

495
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,065
but you look like a sweet guy.

496
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,581
All right.

497
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,656
Drop the gun, shithead.

498
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,960
Now.

499
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,829
Best you give that back
to me, don't you think?

500
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,464
You're a stupid fuck.

501
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,089
Yeah.
And, oh yeah...

502
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,868
...you're under arrest.

503
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,840
And with me back inside,

504
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,810
it got worse for Jenny.
She couldn't take it no more.

505
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,678
I don't want to know where you are...

506
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,580
...until you are safe,
you hear me?

507
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,841
Yeah.

508
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,111
Here.

509
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,346
Go go. Bye.

510
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,391
Come on, trouble man,
I'll race ya.

511
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,187
You're gonna lose.

512
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,235
He spotted them at the train terminal.

513
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,395
He dragged them back to his hideout.

514
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:28,240
Mama pushed me through
the bathroom window...

515
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,380
...and she told me to go to Maria.

516
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,608
But I waited for her.

517
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,277
Carver went psycho...

518
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,588
...when he found out
that Kane had escaped.

519
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:42,784
Jenny wouldn't tell him where he went.

520
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,794
So he beat her.

521
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,353
He raped her.

522
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,764
He shot her.

523
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,384
And he threw her in the canal.

524
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,416
Papa gonna get ya.

525
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,605
Let Kane see his mother.

526
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:34,541
He needs to make his own sense
out of all this.

527
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,137
Let him grieve.

528
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,808
Don't let the pain ferment.

529
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:45,616
It will entomb him...

530
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,423
...like it entombed me.

531
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:50,326
No, man, I can't do that.
Are you kidding me?

532
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,361
It's too dangerous for him.

533
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,363
Carver's already got a bounty on his head.

534
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,199
If we don't get him out of
here tonight, that's it...

535
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,900
All of us are as good as dead,
and that includes you.

536
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,903
I'm not going anywhere until I can see her.

537
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,139
Papi, you've already seen
what he can do to you.

538
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,675
We gotta get you out of here, man.
We gotta get you out of here now.

539
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,437
He'll never forgive you.

540
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,617
Please.

541
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,998
Stay with Kane.

542
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:33,688
All right, man, but hurry up.
We gotta get out of here.

543
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,984
So the kid's at the morgue.

544
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:39,552
Who else?
- Didn't see anyone.

545
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,222
Maybe the stiff guy's there.

546
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,298
That could be fun.

547
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,068
So it's good.
Should I get Rico and G?

548
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,466
Oh no,

549
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:52,064
I'll deal with this myself.

550
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:56,168
Too many people have seen
too much already.

551
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,282
So get the fuck out.

552
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,391
Yo, Carv,

553
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,760
you ought to take it easy
on that kid, all right?

554
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,260
I mean he's your blood.

555
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,661
He done being my blood...

556
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:19,168
...when his whore mother
turned him against me.

557
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,268
All right, Carv.

558
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,614
It's time.

559
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,278
All right, guys.

560
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,689
Well, ain't this some cozy-ass shit?

561
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,299
You have chance to be gone with the kid,

562
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,173
and you fucking stay?

563
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,679
I'm taking the kid now.

564
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,842
No. No.

565
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,918
You can't have him.

566
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,589
You're way out of your depth, boy.

567
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,358
I take what I want.
- That ain't gonna happen.

568
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,690
Fuck.
- No. No.

569
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,789
Motherfucker.

570
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,859
No. No.

571
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,108
Fuck.

572
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,347
No.

573
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,257
Noah.

574
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,234
It's over.

575
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,737
It's over.

576
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,638
Hmm?

577
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,640
You're safe here.

578
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,906
Sleep.

579
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,002
Thank you.

580
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:59,748
How can I help you,
Mr. Bright Lights Big City?

581
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,090
I'm looking for someone
who might have known her.

582
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,760
There you go, handsome.

583
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,500
Careful, it's hot.

584
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,013
Hmm, she's beautiful.

585
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,081
My mother.
I was hoping

586
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:44,176
I'd find someone who remembered her.

587
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:58,890
Well, you enjoy your pie, okay?

588
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,009
Excuse me, sir.

589
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,120
My granddaughter mentioned...

590
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,489
...that you've been making
enquiries about a lady...

591
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:23,058
...who may have lived here a long time ago.

592
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,922
Yes. Please.

593
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,566
I knew her.

594
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,640
And I knew you too...

595
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,634
...when you were a little boy.

596
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:47,580
Your mother and I were very close.

597
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,851
I've written to you many times...

598
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,591
...and I always hoped you'd come.

599
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,819
Oh, my sweet boy.

600
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,164
Come with me.

601
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,224
We were very close.

602
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:18,617
Your mother and I
used to work here together.

603
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:33,684
You know, all I can really remember is...

604
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,919
...she would leave me each night,

605
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:42,623
and one night...

606
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,757
...she didn't come home.

607
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,668
She loved you...

608
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,495
...more than anything
in the whole wide world.

609
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,442
She would do anything for you.

610
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,414
When she couldn't make ends meet,

611
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:02,972
she began to...

612
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,451
...entertain gentlemen.

613
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,047
One of her clients became violent...

614
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,649
...and killed her.

615
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:15,527
That's why she never came back.

616
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,799
They never caught him,

617
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,167
never found out why.

618
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,440
They just dragged you away...

619
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,744
...and wouldn't even let you lay her to rest.

620
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:32,280
They wouldn't let you say goodbye.

621
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,917
Come on, Noah, run with us.

622
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,386
I am. I'm running backwards here.

623
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,886
Hey, Kane, are you tired or what, buddy?

624
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:24,097
Whoo.
- Touchdown.

625
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,272
Oh, fumble on the five-yard line.

626
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,932
Hey, come on, get it.

627
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:03,035
Relax. It's not like it's broken.

628
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,300
Thank you.

629
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,039
You're a kind man.

630
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,553
Run, get him.

631
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,401
Oh my God.

632
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,711
Enough to get you started.

633
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,242
I appreciate that, man.

634
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,211
You're a saint, you know that?

635
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,914
Go find a seat on the bus.
Take him.

636
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,073
Are you ready, Papi?

637
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,804
Go.

638
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,986
Thanks, man.

639
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,642
Alrighty, sir,
are you about ready?

640
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,725
You know, Ava, I must confess

641
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,993
I know nothing about you.

642
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:21,558
Do you have a family?

643
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,636
I do.

644
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,440
He's 13 now.

645
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,947
He lives in the country with my sister,

646
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,675
far away from this place.

647
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,151
I miss him.

648
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:39,084
He must love you very much.

649
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,184
Maybe we can visit him someday.

650
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,489
That would be nice.

651
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:33,041
Poor slob got fished out
of the canal this morning.

652
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,769
Ain't had a happy night.

653
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,472
Hmm, what a shame for him.

654
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,195
Hmm.
