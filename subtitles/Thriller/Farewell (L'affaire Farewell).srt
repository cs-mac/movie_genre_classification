1
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:16,924
- I caught Olga rummaging
through my papers. I was upset!

2
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:19,003
- Look at the shot.

3
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,340
It's amazing!

4
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,673
Borg had a serve
that was very good.

5
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,768
Watch the slow motion.
Of course it is good

6
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,148
We've gotta hurry if you don't want to
miss the beginning. Damien, away we go

7
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,693
Pierre?
- Yes?

8
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,025
- You are coming?
- Yes.

9
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,819
Olga!

10
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:41,285
Securely close it behind you
when you are leaving...

11
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,486
...OK?

12
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,285
Good evening!

13
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,270
Look at your sister!

14
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:06,480
You've seen it also?

15
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,273
There has been some progress!
- Yes!

16
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,126
- Bravo!

17
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,624
- Bravo!

18
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,765
- Bravo! Bravo!

19
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:47,315
- I'm sure I left the car
open. I'll go check.

20
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,613
- Are you crazy! Hurry up!

21
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:45,303
*- The match between Borg and McEnroe
just ended.

22
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:48,476
* Borg won the match...

23
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:52,225
- It is still finite, Borg!
- Damn!

24
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:56,695
What are you doing in my car?
- Your back door was not closed.

25
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,734
- I was told that I would
find you in your car

26
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,154
- In French.

27
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,826
Look ahead.
It will appear more normal.

28
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:06,826
You never know.

29
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,086
How is Jacques?

30
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,548
- Good. Very good.

31
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,342
He told me to tell you...

32
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,338
...That the French Embassies in the
countries of Eastern Europe...

33
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,803
...are open,
to you and your family

34
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,097
- But I do not want to leave!

35
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,602
This is my country here.

36
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,892
Now, I have some important
things for you.

37
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,870
15 top leaders of
the West have...

38
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,162
been working for us...
for a longtime...

39
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,588
You see,
your classmates in the DST will love you.

40
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:52,214
- I don't work for the DST!

41
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:55,421
- You don't work for the secret service?

42
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,682
- Of course not...

43
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,051
 I work here in Moscow,
for Thomsons.

44
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,558
Jacques is my boss.

45
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,484
He just asked me to tell you,
about the embassies.

46
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,609
- That's unbelievable!

47
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:10,698
They sent me an amateur.

48
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,742
It's very French...

49
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:19,458
Is that what you are saying...
- You really want to stay in Moscow?

50
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,079
- I will not flee like the others.
It's pathetic!

51
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,628
I'm not afraid to die.

52
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,175
My country needs me.

53
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,720
I can change the world.

54
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,645
Tell Jacques I don't want
to talk to anyone.

55
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:46,065
What I have done, should be worth
something to guys like you.

56
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,860
- I'm going to leave you, because my daughters
show is something else.

57
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,325
Lock the door before going out.
Good evening.

58
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,290
What a jerk!

59
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,787
They are nothings, those French!

60
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,079
Igor is back?

61
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,161
- In his room.

62
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:36,787
It has taken...

63
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,675
...A warning.
- Why?.

64
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,800
- He has treated Brezhnev old fart.

65
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,287
- What is
the story with Brezhnev?

66
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,335
- All right! It doesn't bother you.

67
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,079
- But not in public, you idiot!

68
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:14,007
There could be some trouble.

69
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:18,260
- Excuse me! I do not want
hurt your brilliant career.

70
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,387
- Don't speak to me in that tone of voice.

71
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,266
Go...

72
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:26,191
I have things to do...

73
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,966
- What are you hearing?

74
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,421
Western music!

75
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,340
Don't worry, go!

76
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:57,677
Your friends have closed the shop.
Bye bye, Queen!

77
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,355
- I heard about the job in
New York was about to be open.

78
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,782
- It will not be easy.
There's lots of people on the list.

79
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,281
But it's not...

80
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:15,455
...For now. Ah, here it is.
Pierre Froment..

81
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,460
...Our engineering student
stationed in Moscow.

82
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:21,037
Maurice Vallier, DST.

83
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,214
- How it happened...

84
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:24,416
...Moscow?

85
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:29,717
- I told him the truth, I
did it just to help you.

86
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,307
He wants to talk to a professional.

87
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:37,013
Your guy is a pathological liar,
who thinks he can change the world.

88
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,107
- This man..

89
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:41,940
...is a colonel.

90
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,106
Colonel Grigoriev.

91
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,118
He was born in Moldova,
he did his studies...

92
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:51,203
.. in Moscow, the KGB and used its
influence at the university.

93
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,744
He occupies a key position.
Everything goes through him.

94
00:09:56,673 --> 00:10:00,506
He has become indispensable
in processing information.

95
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,968
Anyway... we didn't expect it.

96
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:06,303
And the list of names
he gave you...

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,807
.. Is unprecedented
since the beginning of the Cold War.

98
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,609
Voila. Anyway, thank you...

99
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,486
...for your help.

100
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:20,571
- How are you...

101
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,735
...do things, now?

102
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,115
You will contact him yourself?
- Certainly not!

103
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:30,835
The KGB had a file on me. It even has
Grigoriev, who was posted in Paris.

104
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,838
- Given the turn of events,
we will regain control, the...

105
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,054
Excuse me, I am tired.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

106
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,553
- Au revoir.

107
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,062
As expected...

108
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,691
...French elections
have had an upset.

109
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:56,109
Mitterrand was elected
with 51% of the vote.

110
00:10:56,368 --> 00:11:00,319
Apparently he intends to take
Communist ministers...

111
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,989
...In his government.
- They are supposed...

112
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:04,413
...to be his allies.

113
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:06,870
Margaret Thatcher
is opposed.

114
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:10,048
- Never!
I will not let them do that.

115
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,673
We cannot count
on the French!

116
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,890
Our relations with Moscow
are very tense...

117
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,136
...and we must be losing an ally!

118
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,021
You were where? It has begun!

119
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:31,071
- In each store,
at the bottom of every court...

120
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,196
.. Behind a window,
there is a granny...

121
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,448
...One of our brave babushkas,
Simple and discreet...

122
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,667
...But note...

123
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:45,338
...that no one had seen.

124
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,963
Let's drink to our babushkas...

125
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,215
.. Our true sentinel...

126
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:53,348
...Against attacks..

127
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:54,765
...imperialists!

128
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,396
Applause

129
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,274
Let me introduce you to...

130
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,152
.. Our new rookie...

131
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,194
.. which is far from being a babushka...

132
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,069
Alina Samarova!

133
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,696
- Thank you!

134
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:36,567
- Girls, a little less chattering...

135
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,522
...and work more.

136
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,928
- who are happily marching together?

137
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,846
<i>- Our column pioneers!</i>

138
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:11,641
<i>Gaily, gaily,
Always the right place.</i>

139
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,561
<i>Leninist Pioneers.</i>

140
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,572
<i>The Leninists come.</i>

141
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,697
<i>- Be ready!
- Always ready!</i>

142
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,658
<i>- Be brave!
- Always brave!</i>

143
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:57,325
- Hay!

144
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,112
- I thought.

145
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:00,868
...it should work...

146
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,997
...together. Paris
sent someone to see me.

147
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,746
From the airport, we knew who came.

148
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,918
It will never work!

149
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:12,172
- Are you sick or what?

150
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:16,679
- There is no danger.
Nobody in the KGB is interested in you.

151
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,355
You are already in Moscow,
Your assignment folder is empty.

152
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:24,059
or almost.
You could avoid marrying...

153
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,027
...a former East German.

154
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:30,482
But hey!
She went to the West in '57.

155
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,154
She was 8 years old.

156
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,824
Have to go.

157
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,118
Make some copies of the documents
and bring them to me...

158
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,414
...to the Novoslobodskaya station.
on Thursday!

159
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,163
- No, but... wait! Wait!

160
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:00,900
No, but it's incredible!
- Shh!

161
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,693
The plans for the shuttle Columbia.

162
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:04,814
It's crazy!

163
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,823
Look, the notes
by the Russian researchers.

164
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,290
They believe that the fuselage
will not avoid overheating...

165
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:18,334
...when it starts the descent
in the atmosphere. Look!

166
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:30,061
The route of French nuclear submarines
for the next 6 months!

167
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,725
Damn!

168
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,099
- But why?

169
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,815
Why you?

170
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,742
- I know, me?

171
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:45,197
Maybe they mistook me
for someone else.

172
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:49,456
- We must get rid of all that,
fast! It is not possible.

173
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,047
- Wait, this is very serious.
- Be quiet!

174
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:56,381
- We will not throw...

175
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,926
documents we can only dream of...
agents of the West!

176
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,806
It's not your problem.

177
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,217
I married an engineer,
not James Bond.

178
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,147
- Perhaps I can ask
Jacques if...

179
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,985
- - What will Jacques get on the inside?

180
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,701
- He provided occasional services
to the DST

181
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,373
- What?

182
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,625
- I know that over the past three months...

183
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:38,598
- Your boss passed along messages for the
Secret Service, and by chance...

184
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:42,020
.. there was Russian tote in your car
with secret documents..

185
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,685
You are not telling me everything, Peter.

186
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,399
- You think we're all spies
here at Thomson?

187
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,729
Jacques does what he wants with the DST?

188
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,818
I see nothing in all this.

189
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,743
- I sure hope so, because we
in the lion's den, Moscow.

190
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,704
If you do not want
endanger your family...

191
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,084
.. burn it all and forget everything.

192
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:04,830
Forget it!

193
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,921
- OK, you're right.

194
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,676
Tomorrow, I will get rid of it all.

195
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,105
- What is the level of the source?

196
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,572
- Uh... Level One.

197
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:19,413
We believe that the source
will continue to be engaged.

198
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,787
We have planted
a cell within the DST.

199
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:25,038
- Why is the DST dealing with this matter?

200
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:30,429
- The source was stationed here in Paris...

201
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,715
...from 1965 to 1970.

202
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:37,474
and it was during this time
that we made the approach...

203
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,768
we sent a signal...

204
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,054
...there was three months.

205
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:44,650
If this case is assigned
to our colleagues operating abroad...

206
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:46,482
...we will lose contact.

207
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:51,363
The external espionage services
are infiltrated by the KGB.

208
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,072
The Russians have infiltrated...

209
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:56,206
the DST...
because it seemed unnecessary to them.

210
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:59,164
We do not have to intervene
outside the national territory.

211
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,246
- Glad to hear you say that,
Mr. Director.

212
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,463
Continue to follow this case...

213
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:11,298
...and report to me
personally...

214
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,396
because I agree with you on one point
the fewer people involved..

215
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,271
.. the Better.

216
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,442
I can provide a cover for you while I can
count on your loyalty...

217
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,522
.. and my respect.

218
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:26,527
- Mr. President, I have devoted my life
to the defense of the interests of France.

219
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,161
- You can go.

220
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,029
- Mr. President.

221
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,709
What did he put at the...

222
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:38,673
...top of the document?

223
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,384
One moment.

224
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,427
- The code name of the source...

225
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,922
..."Farewell", which means "farewell".

226
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,425
- And why not "Farewell?
- The Russians...

227
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:51,186
...think like the CIA, it will allow us
gain a little time.

228
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,355
- Come in.

229
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:09,826
- The United States cannot accept
Communist ministers...

230
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:11,581
...in Western Europe...

231
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,464
...Or in any free country.

232
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:18,010
- So I ask you,
in the interests of freedom...

233
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,091
...We meet...

234
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,932
.. To review the makeup of
your government.

235
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,940
- I was elected by a free people...

236
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:31,692
.. On the basis of a platform
I will implement...

237
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,191
...and I will fight...

238
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:37,528
...all forms of foreign interference
to guarantee to the people of France...

239
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:40,704
...the freedom to choose their own destiny.
Without interference...

240
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,531
...in American affairs,
I think...

241
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,045
...I'm a
sincere ally of the United States...

242
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:50,133
.. and I bring this to your attention.

243
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,880
A top-level source
sent us this list.

244
00:21:56,642 --> 00:22:00,225
There are fifteen U.S. citizens
working with NASA, the CIA..

245
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:03,018
Pentagon...
and the White House.

246
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:06,441
Everything indicates that they have a
direct link with Moscow.

247
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:24,787
- Now, between the two of us

248
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,600
you know...

249
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,095
I was going to do a film with Ford..

250
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:41,017
it never happened, due
to a mix-up with the studio.

251
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,393
I can't remember any more

252
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,439
- Mr. President,
it's getting late...

253
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,027
- I do not trust Mitterrand.

254
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:55,164
He is just making waves
to buy some time with his Communist ministers.

255
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:58,664
This Farewell business.. This is bogus.

256
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,833
- I sincerely hope, sir.

257
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,094
If this proves to be true...

258
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:07,590
- The last two names on this list.

259
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,424
I want to know them before I get back
to Washington.

260
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:14,350
The last two names?

261
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,186
- Not a word to Feeney about this!

262
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:20,905
- If he found out
I was snooping behind his back...

263
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:25,738
He may be the CIA boss,
but I'm the boss of the United States.

264
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,439
- Ah The Pentagon!

265
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,771
It's good, eh?
I've put the...

266
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:40,892
.. plans...

267
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:42,269
...of Air Force One

268
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:43,861
It's funny.

269
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:48,489
- for your consideration. 
How you doing?

270
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,416
For the documents, all that
they asked me was how much you want.

271
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,501
- you will become a little spy.

272
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:56,751
Suspicion.

273
00:25:57,006 --> 00:26:01,753
- No, I can assure you the contact will 
will find another solution in a while.

274
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:05,429
So, how much you want?
- Money, money!

275
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:08,010
What I can give you is priceless!

276
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,061
- I will tell them.

277
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,464
- Keep your money...

278
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:36,132
...And bring me some cognac and
champagne in Paris

279
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,006
They will all ask about the
bottles in my office.

280
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,055
That will be the day
there will no longer be...

281
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,639
birds chirping

282
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,856
- It is not easy to
speak in Russian?

283
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:56,023
- I like to speak French.
and who I can talk to...

284
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:59,239
...If not you?
- It would be more practical, anyway.

285
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,372
The next time
I'll bring the champagne.

286
00:27:05,921 --> 00:27:08,079
- You French are chauvinists.

287
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:13,802
So are we.

288
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,056
I got my engineering degree here...

289
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,601
in 55.
And my son Igor will be...

290
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,516
...an engineer here also.

291
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,453
You are always in love...

292
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,116
...Your wife?

293
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,500
- Yes, of course

294
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:43,003
- We all love our women,
but in our own way.

295
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:49,300
You can return to Igor...

296
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,587
...Johnny Walkman?

297
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,011
- "Johnny Walkman"?

298
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,382
I don't know that.

299
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:56,103
Sony! A Sony walkman, no?

300
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:58,432
- Yes... Walkman.
- Yeah.

301
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:02,440
- Maybe Sony.
And the group...

302
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:04,523
Cassettes of the
American group "The Kin".

303
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,157
- "Kin"?

304
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:09,824
No, Queen! They are English.
Queen.

305
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,405
We will, we will rock you

306
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,122
- Perhaps, yes.
- You don't know?

307
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,242
- You like that?

308
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:19,047
- Yeah, that’s fine.

309
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,134
- Me, I love Ferré.

310
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:24,966
- Ferré, that’s good!

311
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:26,597
- What poetry!

312
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:32,437
And can you also bring me
some French poems?

313
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:34,266
And cassettes by Ferré?

314
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:36,981
- And a hundred balls
and a salad Nicoise, too?

315
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:38,980
Look, I'm not Fnac!

316
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,363
Your departure and arrival times...

317
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:45,784
...are written in a notebook
by the guys in the booth.

318
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:48,909
And then there are two men
in a Lada...

319
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,085
who followed you...
when you were driving.

320
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:55,292
- And the cleaning woman who searches
the apartment when no one is around

321
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:57,965
- But people who watch...

322
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:01,137
...are not amused.
If you're nice to them...

323
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,510
...They will like you a lot
and they will never suspect anything.

324
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:12,602
Next week
same line in the subway.

325
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,565
One last thing!

326
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,110
- What?
- The French residence...

327
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,369
...Is bugged.
You know that, I guess.

328
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,280
Yes, I know.

329
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,449
- Especially in the ceilings

330
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,828
So if a guy does not intend to be
with his wife in bed...

331
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,788
...he has a girl in his sights,
and there are possibilities, then...

332
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,716
...kiss his wife,
it is the only way to keep the peace.

333
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:37,003
Funny, eh?

334
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:38,545
- No, it’s not funny.

335
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:21,895
Pardon Me

336
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:35,728
I can't

337
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:39,902
because of Igor
and also because of Serge. I...

338
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:50,747
- You can't spend your life
sacrificing yourself for others

339
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:54,919
You're unhappy, Natasha.
- Enough, start!

340
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:58,343
Démarre,
We can't be seen here!

341
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,673
I'm tired of lies.

342
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,551
- Think of yourself first.

343
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:31,250
No,
we have no new name...

344
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:36,090
- ... But the source has provided us
with some very important documents.

345
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,636
What kind of documents?

346
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:43,146
*- They include air defense plans
of the United States.

347
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,022
* I am looking
all radar positions...

348
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,814
*... installed on your territory
since 1976...

349
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:52,826
*... your coded procedures
to trigger an attack...

350
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,569
*... in case of enemy air attack.

351
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,405
* In the margin, written in Russian...

352
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:02,203
*... he has the keys to engage
you at the same time.

353
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,920
* I also have the codes
to get into the White House...

354
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:12,308
*... schedules of companies
delivering food and clothes.

355
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:16,724
* as well as the Codes
used since 1959...

356
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,730
*... by your embassies
to communicate.

357
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:23,818
- I see.

358
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:31,485
Someone is coming

359
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:00,311
I thought

360
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:02,068
.. that you would not come.

361
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:04,567
- I think it is a mistake.

362
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,455
- Me too.

363
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,160
- Smile!
Remember your own wedding!

364
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,831
Shoot me with them! Voila!

365
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:39,551
- Of course, comrade

366
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,795
I am a professional photographer..

367
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:00,987
- Get closer.

368
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,110
A smile!

369
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,532
Thanks

370
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:17,794
- It's a good dream, communism.

371
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,466
- Yes, happiness flows
in your streets.

372
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,885
People are uplifted with joy.

373
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,517
- It's difficult to realize,
that dream.

374
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,194
You know what state
Russia was in '17?

375
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,730
The Middle Ages.

376
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,110
And after 40 years,
it was first...

377
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,327
...to send a man
space.

378
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,573
The first!

379
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,835
Today
the system is totally plugged up

380
00:37:45,086 --> 00:37:47,543
We must blow up the system.

381
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:51,093
That's why I am giving you
all this information.

382
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:55,343
When the Soviet bloc will no longer exist
You loot, everything will fly...

383
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,509
...and there will be a new revolution.

384
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,974
I don't see that,
But Igor, my son...

385
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,519
...it will be alive in him.

386
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:06,611
That is it, my reward.

387
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:13,818
- Speaking of Igor, I have taken back
the things you asked me for.

388
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:18,250
A walkman.

389
00:38:19,543 --> 00:38:20,659
with some cassettes...

390
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,794
...by Queen.
And a Léo Ferré for you.

391
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:23,878
- That's nice.

392
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,967
- For the book of poetry...

393
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,511
...I've taken
Lagarde and Michard one.

394
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,141
A school book...

395
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:34,931
...being used for the shelf.
It's the 19th.

396
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,477
You Baudelaire, Mallarme...

397
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,808
You'll be amused with that.

398
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,776
- I can't accept it.

399
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,355
It is a personal book, right?

400
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:47,486
- You're not serious.
It was thrown in a closet.

401
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,238
My wife would use it more.

402
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,827
- But she doesn't know...

403
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,454
...you gave it to me.
- If, of course.

404
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:58,453
- we quickly learn...

405
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,126
...a lie, eh?

406
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,758
I too am a lie.

407
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:11,051
And lonely. You, you should talk
Jacques has it all, has other...

408
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,725
But me...

409
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,558
Je n'ai que vous, Pierre.

410
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:21,030
You were on vacation?
- Yes, for 2 weeks.

411
00:39:21,283 --> 00:39:23,406
With my parents in the Vercors.

412
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,330
- Oh.
- What is there?

413
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,368
- Holidays
were introduced in France...

414
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,081
...by a communist government.

415
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:35,627
- You are trying to piss me off?
- A little.

416
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:40,710
*- The little cat...
- The little cat...

417
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:42,764
*- Fled...
- Fled...

418
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:46,018
*- In the park!
- In the park!

419
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,014
*- In the park!
- In the park!

420
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:49,222
What?

421
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:51,855
*- Will attack him!
- Will attack him!

422
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:54,816
*- Who left...
- Who left...

423
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:57,991
*- The door open?
- The door open?

424
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:28,473
- Well done!

425
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:34,515
- Let, let! Oh
It’s our fault!

426
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:36,931
No, but let me do it!
- Peter!

427
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,643
There's someone looking for you.

428
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,947
- Continue.
I'll have...

429
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,859
...a glass.
- I'm coming!

430
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:48,820
- You asked Jacques
to come here?

431
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:51,620
- There is something to clear up
on a file.

432
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,205
- A file on what?

433
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,039
- You're doing it again?

434
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,630
- I apologize.
I imagined a bunch of stuff.

435
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:04,052
- It's not serious.

436
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:08,143
Go! Where is it?

437
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:11,348
I would...

438
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:14,359
To thank...
again the CIA...

439
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,603
...in the person of Mr. Feeney,
its director...

440
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,987
...for this valuable collaboration.

441
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,238
If I may, Mr. President...

442
00:42:23,496 --> 00:42:25,536
...I'll continue in French.

443
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,664
Thanks to the last
information from Farewell...

444
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:36,924
...We can see the global
Soviet espionage system.

445
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,094
The KGB is not the only
ones spying on us.

446
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,640
Every business in the East...

447
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,597
...Science Academies,
and even smaller...

448
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,184
participants in...
a trade show...

449
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,070
...are involved.

450
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:56,320
And all these networks send
routine information...

451
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,119
...that is centrally...

452
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,241
...reviewed by a body
we didn't know...

453
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:05,034
...even existed: The VPK.
- How many agents...

454
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,039
...Work in this agency?

455
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:10,168
Who's in charge it and since when?

456
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:14,634
- I don't have that reliable
information at my disposal...

457
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,764
...that would allow me to answer you.

458
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:18,048
- A long time ago, wee too heard about the...

459
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:19,770
VPK... for some time.

460
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:23,012
It's like the
Loch Ness monster!

461
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,310
- This is why you decided
we should never talk.

462
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,496
- Good, continue...

463
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,122
Mr. Director

464
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,238
- We have calculated...

465
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,956
...that the Russians spend more...

466
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:46,041
...For industrial espionage
than they do for their own research.

467
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:48,260
They take the risk of looking...

468
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:51,633
...But they want to
buy insurance...

469
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,014
they will find something
and it costs them dearly.

470
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,843
The looting is over 40%...

471
00:43:57,106 --> 00:44:00,273
...of their overall budget
in the arms race.

472
00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:03,809
- Well...

473
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:07,863
That's incredible.
Are you sure?

474
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,032
- Sure.

475
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:10,945
- 40%?

476
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,447
Can you imagine...

477
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,203
...the sums at stake?

478
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,296
It doesn't make any sense.

479
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,961
To feed the enemy good information
to hook them 

480
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:23,756
...then dish out a lot of baloney...

481
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:25,721
...Is an old tactic.

482
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:28,432
But you know...

483
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:29,681
- Absolutely.

484
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:34,603
But Farewell is the finest
source of all time...

485
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:36,317
...Mr. President.

486
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:41,488
- I was given this to give to you.

487
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:44,701
There's a second...

488
00:44:44,954 --> 00:44:46,993
...If the other fails.

489
00:44:47,249 --> 00:44:50,415
- The Minox?
Is it from the CIA?

490
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:53,587
They're involved?
- No, not really.

491
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,295
but they know that the DST
has a source in Moscow.

492
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,338
They know your identity,
as well as mine.

493
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,221
- Why are they asking that?

494
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:03,632
So far it has been
going very well without them.

495
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:07,096
- Here are the detailed photos
taken under any conditions.

496
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:09,893
While photographing
documents on the spot...

497
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,108
...and no more lugging them away!

498
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,648
- Someone from the CIA
gave you these devices...

499
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:19,905
...So now they know
who you are, who I am!

500
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:25,618
- But no! It was Jacques who
discreetly passed them along in France.

501
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:29,044
And I've stashed them
in a little train for my son.

502
00:45:29,297 --> 00:45:30,958
Voila! Okay?

503
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:37,508
I'll stop everything.

504
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:39,675
It became too much for me.

505
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,898
It's a big operation.
It already had a code name: "Farewell".

506
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,686
It was back on track
until Mitterrand and Reagan

507
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:53,946
I can't stand lying to my wife.
I am doing it more, it disgusts me.

508
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:55,993
Then we'll stop seeing each other.

509
00:45:56,246 --> 00:46:00,410
Now, I know
what will happen. They will tell you

510
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:03,871
- You are arrogant,
pretentious and pathetic...

511
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,420
...You, the people of West!

512
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:09,795
It's me who decides how and to whom,
I give...

513
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:13,969
...what I want! Tell those idiots at
the DST they will change...

514
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:16,551
...Nothing!
Nothing!

515
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:20,395
Nobody buys me, never!

516
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:21,396
Enough!

517
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,524
- You are busting my balls!

518
00:46:23,778 --> 00:46:25,059
Me too, I will decide!

519
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:29,818
It's over for me! I will not
throw away my life and my marriage...

520
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,487
...For reasons of state!

521
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:33,454
Good luck and so long!

522
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,042
- Not so fast!

523
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,458
Where are you off?
What were you doing in this car?

524
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:45,799
Your papers?

525
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:47,926
- Kind of stupid!

526
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:49,463
What a moron!

527
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,600
That's not possible!

528
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,141
Go! In the car!

529
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,355
This is my cousin from Leningrad!

530
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:05,361
It is dumb.

531
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,018
You're angry, I know.

532
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:36,353
But we will finish this story, Peter.
Both of us.

533
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:45,156
Soon, a large file
will come into the hands of the service.

534
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,826
The X list!

535
00:47:51,213 --> 00:47:52,708
Bingo!

536
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:27,790
- What's the story?

537
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,547
- This is the X list.
This is the cream of creams.

538
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:36,972
The best agents at the Embassy / the Consulate.

539
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:40,726
You provide the X list...

540
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:43,354
It's killing the system.

541
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:51,941
You know the favorite poem
of your wife?

542
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:55,402
- I don't have the heart for poetry,

543
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:57,574
- "The Death of the Wolf. "

544
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,708
By Alfred de Vigny.

545
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,091
- What's the poem about?

546
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:12,340
- A couple of wolves with 2 little ones,
had been raised by the poet and his friends...

547
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:13,929
The pups were slowing them...

548
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:18,433
...And the hunters approached quickly.
So the male stopped...

549
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:20,812
...to wait for the hunter.

550
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,106
and the mother fled with the pups.

551
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:28,446
obviously, the hunters
killed the male wolf...

552
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:31,160
...who died in silence.

553
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:32,578
In silence.

554
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:36,202
You scared?
- Yeah, I'm afraid.

555
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:39,332
I am afraid for my children,
for my wife and for me.

556
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:41,584
Even with diplomatic protection.

557
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:46,387
- Diplomatic Protection?
To me, this will be the special treatment.

558
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:47,590
- And for you...

559
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,229
...It's a truck.
An unfortunate accident.

560
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,483
Watch the road.

561
00:49:58,738 --> 00:50:02,867
- Drop me off at Smolenskaya station.
It will be easier for you.

562
00:50:03,118 --> 00:50:05,242
- You will follow me?

563
00:50:05,496 --> 00:50:08,249
- Not worth it.
I asked Jacques for your address...

564
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:11,371
...Your phone number, a photo
of your wife and your son.

565
00:50:11,628 --> 00:50:15,045
Me too, I know a
lot about you.

566
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:29,228
When you finish this last case,
agree to stay in the West.

567
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:34,525
In time the dust will settle.
Then you will come back a hero.

568
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,113
- In their eyes, I'll always be a traitor.

569
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,747
I do the dirty work
nobody wants to do.

570
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,660
Until Thursday.

571
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,386
Good evening.

572
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:04,722
- Good evening.

573
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,563
- Good evening.

574
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:13,993
Drop by.

575
00:51:21,753 --> 00:51:23,994
The two women can talk.

576
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,343
- Hello Igor!

577
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,108
- It's a Good day?

578
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:52,991
- Are you interested in what I am doing,
now?

579
00:51:53,623 --> 00:51:56,410
A super day!
We studied...

580
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,800
the benefits of the FYP
under Khrushchev...

581
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:07,345
Solved...
differential equations...

582
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:12,260
...discussed poverty in New York
and there were some potatoes at lunch.

583
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:14,480
Everything is great!

584
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,273
- Who's the lady with your mother?

585
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:23,564
She came to see the puppies,
after seeing the advertisement.

586
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,659
- Serge. Have you seen the book
on dog breeds?

587
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:30,369
Sergei!

588
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,418
- The book on dog breeds?

589
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,913
- I put it away the other night.

590
00:52:38,343 --> 00:52:39,421
- Where?

591
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:44,305
- Look under the sofa.

592
00:53:10,005 --> 00:53:12,377
"Who's the woman with mother?

593
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:14,122
For Shame!

594
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:17,884
- Listen Igor... with couples
there are times...

595
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:19,550
- Stop the bullshit...

596
00:53:19,808 --> 00:53:21,847
...Agree?
You are lying to me...

597
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:25,729
...You lie to mom
you lie to everyone!

598
00:53:26,231 --> 00:53:27,347
It is your nature!

599
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:30,267
A professional distortion!

600
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:33,897
Leave us outside
all your lies, okay?

601
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:35,154
It is the cowards...

602
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,698
...who lie!
And the traitors!

603
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,127
- Let me see!

604
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,016
Have you gone completely mad?
Sit down.

605
00:53:58,686 --> 00:54:01,142
Don't touch me
Don't touch anything

606
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,525
- Don't worry, I will say nothing

607
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:15,618
But you can give me some more lessons.

608
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:18,947
Get out of my room.

609
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:22,164
Get out of my room.

610
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:43,570
Someone is coming.

611
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,028
- You're mad!
You don't know..

612
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:51,905
- I couldn't help it.
I had to find out where you live...

613
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,372
...It is how it is,
it’s how she talks to you

614
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:57,249
...it’s how you live...
together!

615
00:54:57,797 --> 00:54:59,625
I couldn't resist it.

616
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:05,303
- Everything is going too fast.

617
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:08,468
Let’s take just a little time...

618
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:10,597
...to let things clear up.

619
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:12,772
- Serge. please forgive me.

620
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,352
- I don't understand.

621
00:55:16,486 --> 00:55:19,024
- Forgive me for the awful thing
I've done.

622
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:25,659
Serge. I want to be with you always...

623
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:27,456
...whatever happens.

624
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,164
Super 8 Projector

625
00:56:23,605 --> 00:56:25,398
- Hello.
What is the problem?

626
00:56:25,942 --> 00:56:27,899
- Hello, Comrade Captain!

627
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:31,854
Yesterday, my wife and I
got home at 4 in the morning.

628
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,491
There was nobody here...

629
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:38,330
...to record our return
in your notebook!

630
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,867
Excuse me
but I think it's serious.

631
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:43,458
- Bring the book.

632
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:49,300
- What about the documents
while I'm away...

633
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:52,638
...While I'm here,
talking to you!

634
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:04,603
- Yesterday, we were short staffed
at the embassy level.

635
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:06,020
Exactly.

636
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,826
It won't happen again,
I assure you.

637
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:14,449
- I trust you, Captain.
Let’s forget it!

638
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:15,703
Wait!

639
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:22,588
Look! I bought the cognac
for an office party.

640
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:24,582
Drink to your health.

641
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:26,878
- Thank You.

642
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,323
- What are you doing?

643
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:51,456
It said it was in your car.

644
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:55,830
I've brought you what you wanted
for Christmas.

645
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:04,382
- I did something stupid, Peter.

646
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:07,928
I have a mistress.

647
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:11,022
My son knows and Natasha does too.

648
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:16,400
- It's not very serious. It happens.
There's ups and downs.

649
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,779
- My son hates me now.

650
00:58:20,952 --> 00:58:23,953
It is very important to him
I'm taking risks here.

651
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,835
- Why didn't you tell him
the truth?

652
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:31,704
- He never listen to me.
More so now than ever!

653
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,343
- You have nothing for me?

654
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,611
The X list?
- Patience.

655
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:54,320
That will be very soon.

656
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:17,261
- In the library...

657
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,226
...there is nothing interesting.

658
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:24,185
In the room
my wife left at the side of her bed...

659
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:28,728
...the plans for the French Alliance
next month.

660
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:31,781
Show it to your leaders.

661
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:34,578
It will make a good impression.

662
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:37,030
Agree?

663
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:28,260
- Be careful, it's fragile.

664
01:00:28,518 --> 01:00:30,594
- We have to be careful our whole life...

665
01:00:30,854 --> 01:00:31,553
Careful

666
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:40,323
- The street is blocked
we can't say why

667
01:00:40,574 --> 01:00:44,703
<i>Ten years of memories

668

671

672
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:06,680
<i>It's a street name
Where will ever I'm on</i>

673
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,432
<i>So very sad</i>

674
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:11,104

689
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:26,858
- What's up?

690
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:41,830
- I saw you in the park today
with a man.

691
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,421
You are pathetic.
Totally nuts.

692
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:53,509
You have been lying to me...

693
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:56,098
...right from the beginning.
And I can't take it.

694
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:00,643
I'm leaving.

695
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:03,029
I lost confidence.

696
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,198
And I must protect
our children from everything

697
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:13,118
No, leave me.

698
01:03:33,317 --> 01:03:36,570
- Four times I have delivered
documents to the West.

699
01:03:38,366 --> 01:03:40,358
I photographed them.

700
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,320
And I took the film to Paris,
like any tourist.

701
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,372
I never had a problem.

702
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,380
The photos are being studied
at the Elysée.

703
01:03:50,631 --> 01:03:52,872
Then the White House.

704
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:57,713
For the first time, it is possible
things can really change.

705
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:02,634
But I told Jacques
it was over, that I was finished.

706
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:08,192
It makes me sick
that I have had to hide everything and lie to you.

707
01:04:08,442 --> 01:04:10,933
I have an ulcer since summer.

708
01:04:15,827 --> 01:04:20,371
I know, I should have explained it
but I couldn't do it without risk.

709
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,748
But I was a coward
I preferred to lie to you.

710
01:04:35,892 --> 01:04:38,383
I completely screwed up.

711
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:41,263
I will love you always.

712
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:44,934
Let me be with you.

713
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:50,907
I will ask Jacques for a post
New York, that will be open in two months.

714
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,485
And I will get it, believe me!

715
01:04:54,622 --> 01:04:58,571
I'll never have worry about
keeping anything hidden from you.

716
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:01,409
I promise you, never again!

717
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,135
- You don't even ask me
what I think of New York.

718
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:10,886
- You're the one who wanted to go
New York, from the start!

719
01:05:18,733 --> 01:05:20,277
Look at me.

720
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:21,690
Look at me.

721
01:05:28,662 --> 01:05:29,942
Viens.

722
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,911
- What are you doing?

723
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,028
Nothing

724
01:06:42,122 --> 01:06:43,665
Anatoly was...

725
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,203
...who I made my report to...

726
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,957
...on French Arms.

727
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:49,962
You know...

728
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,330
...what he did with it?

729
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:54,345
- He released it to the meeting.
Weren't you there?

730
01:06:55,722 --> 01:06:57,550
- Go to the meeting...

731
01:06:57,808 --> 01:06:59,634
...it’s getting late in the morning.

732
01:07:03,522 --> 01:07:06,975
- We haven't seen one another,
nor talked for a very long time, Serge. I...

733
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:10,985
- I have had a lot of work
now.

734
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:14,368
But let us do it Wednesday night.

735
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:16,157
We need to talk.

736
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:23,161
- What is wrong with you?

737
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:25,831
What is wrong with you?

738
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:32,596
- His father, during the war...

739
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,257
...commanded a division of the SS

740
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:41,181
Mine was a simple cook,
at the back.

741
01:07:41,735 --> 01:07:43,727
But I'm better than him.

742
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,106
Right?

743
01:07:53,372 --> 01:07:55,080
The other day

744
01:07:55,334 --> 01:07:56,876
...they were all excited in my office...

745
01:07:57,127 --> 01:08:00,628
...And he asked me, "Alina,
What is the meaning of "farewell"? "

746
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:03,584
I explained it
and he said:

747
01:08:03,843 --> 01:08:08,222
..."I learned French
so I could have a cushy job...

748
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:11,012
..."And they got mixed up
with the English! "

749
01:08:23,116 --> 01:08:26,782
- I will tell him the joke,
Anatoly was brave.

750
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:29,069
- What are you gonna do?

751
01:08:40,554 --> 01:08:42,345
- On Wednesday?
- On Wednesday.

752
01:08:56,906 --> 01:08:58,649
Ophélie! Ophélie!

753
01:09:09,588 --> 01:09:10,962
- It's over, Peter.

754
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:12,757
The X list is...

755
01:09:13,008 --> 01:09:15,630
...In your pocket.
We won.

756
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:21,801
When you return from Paris
we'll drink champagne.

757
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:53,137
- I never  listen to music much.

758
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,596
- watch out for the paranoid

759
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,008
They listen to
everyone, especially in Paris.

760
01:09:59,145 --> 01:10:02,431
- Jacques, my wife
is a nervous wreck in Moscow.

761
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:04,684
She is cracking up because of all this.

762
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:06,188
We gotta go.

763
01:10:06,446 --> 01:10:09,401
The position of New York will be open.
It will be New York.

764
01:10:09,658 --> 01:10:12,031
- I am not deciding alone.

765
01:10:14,622 --> 01:10:16,081
- We will listen.

766
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:25,920
The X list.

767
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,216
- Complete?

768
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:30,097
- Yes, complete.

769
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,481
I'll convince Grigoriev he
has to spend with his family in the West.

770
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,357
I just need to know
how it will happen.

771
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,572
- You are crazy!

772
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,733
New York, you see,
but to have it happen...

773
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:50,030
...it's a source in the West that Moscow
happens to like.

774
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,913
- Yes, exactly!

775
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,785
From the beginning, we
only to play by our skin.

776
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:58,038
So that's enough!

777
01:10:59,716 --> 01:11:02,884
You must assure me of
my safety and that of Grigoriev.

778
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:09,969
Yes?

779
01:11:30,377 --> 01:11:31,326
<i>- Paname</i>

780
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,876
<i>Me me it is your eyes and your lips</i>

781
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:39,375
<i>That I want to kiss right</i>

782
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:42,095
- Where you find
French songs?

783
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,342
- Leave me some secrets...

784
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:46,512
- Paname!

785
01:12:15,137 --> 01:12:15,920
I'm going...

786
01:12:16,181 --> 01:12:18,754
...to Leningrad
in two weeks.

787
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,350
They are looking for
an French interpreter.

788
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:27,771
You will never leave your wife
or your family.

789
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:30,816
I understood I was going home.

790
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:38,414
You're a little loose...

791
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,623
...Like all married men...

792
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,159
...Sergei...

793
01:12:50,013 --> 01:12:51,886
Hold me in your arms...

794
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,179
...And then take me back to my house.

795
01:13:08,075 --> 01:13:09,356
<i>- Good...</i>

796
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:13,911
<i>Now, between the two eyes.</i>

797
01:13:20,048 --> 01:13:20,830
- Not bad...

798
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:21,837
...Eh?

799
01:13:25,054 --> 01:13:27,510
- It makes you want to see the whole movie.

800
01:13:28,474 --> 01:13:32,389
- I haven't had time
to arrange a screening...

801
01:13:33,063 --> 01:13:35,816
...But I wanted to show you
this change...

802
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:38,060
...point of view.
It's a masterpiece.

803
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,733
Feeney came to see me this morning.

804
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:51,039
One of their moles in the KGB
identified Farewell..

805
01:13:51,751 --> 01:13:52,498
- What?

806
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:54,076
- Don't worry.

807
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,586
They are only the only two
who know what the CIA has.

808
01:13:58,051 --> 01:13:59,877
- Are the French aware?

809
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:02,805
- Well...

810
01:14:03,599 --> 01:14:06,932
Feeney doesn't think we should tell them,
and I agree.

811
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,065
We know enough
to act without them.

812
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:15,983
- What will you and Feeney do?

813
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:19,571
- Wipe out their X List
then play poker!

814
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:22,779
It's more fun to bluff...

815
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:26,205
...When we know that the adversary has
a pathetic hand!

816
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:29,747
- You are completely right,
Mr. President.

817
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:34,082
It's a new game.
We'll have to strike hard.

818
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:22,127
- Ten, nine, eight...

819
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:25,969
...seven, six, five...

820
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:27,221
...four...

821
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,973
*- Mes chers compatriotes...

822
01:16:33,233 --> 01:16:35,985
*... merci de partager ce moment
avec moi, ce soir.

823
01:16:36,653 --> 01:16:40,189
*J'aimerais vous parler
de sécurité et de paix...

824
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:43,201
*... sujets aussi fondamentaux
que cruciaux.

825
01:16:43,452 --> 01:16:44,533
* Avec nos alliés...

826
01:16:44,788 --> 01:16:48,786
*... nous avons su contenir
une guerre nucléaire pendant 30 ans.

827
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:52,835
*Cette approche stable,
au moyen d'une menace offensive...

828
01:16:53,089 --> 01:16:54,168
*... a bien fonctionné.

829
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,380
* After consultation
my advisors...

830
01:16:57,636 --> 01:16:59,546
*... I think there is another way of

831
01:17:01,724 --> 01:17:06,683
* countering the threat
Soviet nuclear missiles...

832
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:10,773
*... by defensive measures
placed in Earth orbit

833
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:14,028
*There are risks and the
results will take time.

834
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,950
*But I think
we can do it

835
01:17:17,201 --> 01:17:19,193
* When this step...

836
01:17:19,453 --> 01:17:22,953
*... I ask for your prayers
and to support me.

837
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,659
* Thank you, good night,
and God bless you!

838
01:17:26,921 --> 01:17:27,916
Amen!

839
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:39,928
What do you know?, the KGB?,
these "defensive measures?...

840
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,642
"placed in Earth orbit?

841
01:17:42,897 --> 01:17:45,602
- there have been leaks
in the American press.

842
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,484
They nicknamed this project...

843
01:17:47,736 --> 01:17:49,563
..."Star Wars".
- Tell me.

844
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:53,490
- Unfortunately
we know nothing more.

845
01:17:53,744 --> 01:17:56,994
We have lost almost
all our sources of information.

846
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,533
But it is only temporary!

847
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:03,294
I ordered an extensive investigation...

848
01:18:03,881 --> 01:18:05,920
...Which is moving very quickly.

849
01:18:06,383 --> 01:18:09,836
- To establish
our own "Star Wars"...

850
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:12,512
...How long will it take?

851
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:17,018
- 10 years. Minimum!

852
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,519
- Thank you,

853
01:18:20,775 --> 01:18:21,724
...Comrades.

854
01:18:31,914 --> 01:18:34,322
- Andropov asked to
go to Geneva.

855
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:37,912
He is not ready. I
will see Reagan.

856
01:18:38,546 --> 01:18:41,298
I will try to convince
to renounce...

857
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,293
...this project, but...

858
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,927
he will go after...

859
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:49,635
...especially today.
Because it has been well known...

860
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:53,428
...we have no way
we can monitor them.

861
01:18:54,273 --> 01:18:56,728
The country is
in a critical situation...

862
01:18:56,984 --> 01:18:59,309
...particularly dangerous,
Comrade General

863
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:03,731
The country must
take a deep breath...

864
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:07,321
...find new energy,
otherwise it will sink...

865
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,333
...Into chaos.
For the country, more than ever...

866
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:13,289
...needs reforms.
Urgent reforms!

867
01:19:54,718 --> 01:19:57,044
The door is closing.

868
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:01,851
*- What are you doing?

869
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:04,851
*- How?
*- Get out of here!

870
01:20:15,619 --> 01:20:16,780
* You want a coffee?

871
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,032
*- Not after noon.

872
01:20:19,288 --> 01:20:21,246
*- It has been dark for a while.

873
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:36,213
*- You told Natasha
I am in Moscow?

874
01:20:39,854 --> 01:20:41,054
* How is she?

875
01:20:43,066 --> 01:20:44,693
* In the last letter...

876
01:20:44,944 --> 01:20:47,649
*... she wrote
it's very hard for her.

877
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:01,914
I am so stupid! You know all that!

878
01:21:06,093 --> 01:21:07,125
You've been reading?

879
01:21:09,806 --> 01:21:10,970
I think...

880
01:21:11,851 --> 01:21:13,429
...we will find...

881
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:16,388
...she and I...

882
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:20,767
- they are clever, these Americans!

883
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:24,273
Take on an identity as lovers...

884
01:21:24,532 --> 01:21:26,240
...of French culture.

885
01:21:27,077 --> 01:21:28,108
Tell me...

886
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:31,040
...who was your contact
in the American Embassy...

887
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,913
...and what did you give him
Specifically...

888
01:21:34,168 --> 01:21:35,628
...you can save yourself.

889
01:21:40,592 --> 01:21:41,589
Tell me.

890
01:21:46,683 --> 01:21:49,305
- "But the children of the wolf...

891
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:51,020
..."played in silence...

892
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:53,430
"... Not knowing that on two...

893
01:21:53,692 --> 01:21:56,728
..."only half asleep...
The door opens.

894
01:21:56,987 --> 01:21:59,525
"Behind the walls...

895
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:01,360
"their enemy. "

896
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:05,820
"But the children of the wolf
played in silence... "

897
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:07,325
- Coming back to the point.

898
01:22:09,501 --> 01:22:12,871
You're here because your friends
betrayed you, Grigoriev.

899
01:22:13,673 --> 01:22:14,954
You're all alone!

900
01:22:15,926 --> 01:22:18,252
Think abou my suggestion...

901
01:22:18,512 --> 01:22:22,926
- "He looks at us again
Then he lies down again...

902
01:22:23,184 --> 01:22:28,939
..."While licking the blood
spread on his lips. "

903
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:30,308
- Goodbye!

904
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:32,883
- What did you do?

905
01:23:33,558 --> 01:23:34,424
- Nothing.

906
01:23:35,352 --> 01:23:37,808
They think I am someone who is...

907
01:23:38,523 --> 01:23:41,014
*... working for the Americans...

908
01:23:41,986 --> 01:23:43,978
* They will find out they are wrong.

909
01:23:45,531 --> 01:23:46,693
Do not worry.

910
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:54,369
Igor didn't come?

911
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:56,741
- He is in school.

912
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:00,872
He'll spend the morning

913
01:24:02,593 --> 01:24:03,624
- Don't cry...

914
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:05,626
...my dear.

915
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:09,928
And straighten up!

916
01:24:12,646 --> 01:24:15,683
- If you tell them everything,
they will let you go home.

917
01:24:17,902 --> 01:24:20,108
- Is that what he said?

918
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:24,442
- Forgive me, please.

919
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,498
Please, forgive me.

920
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:32,491
- You too

921
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:43,302
You really want
I come home?

922
01:24:44,934 --> 01:24:45,634
Yes!

923
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:11,586
- Madame...
- Hey!

924
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:13,252
- I beg you.

925
01:25:14,052 --> 01:25:16,922
I am a friend of your husband.
I'm French.

926
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,556
Where is he? He is suffering?

927
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,383
- My husband has nothing to do with you.

928
01:25:21,727 --> 01:25:24,895
The dismal KGB traps!
Shame

929
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,936
- This is not a trap.
I can help you.

930
01:25:28,276 --> 01:25:28,976
- Let us be!

931
01:25:29,235 --> 01:25:32,106
- I am a French residence.
- Leave us be!

932
01:25:32,365 --> 01:25:33,195
- Madame!

933
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:58,515
- Have you searched the parents room?
- Not yet, I'm going.

934
01:26:00,605 --> 01:26:01,981
- You looked everywhere?

935
01:26:02,232 --> 01:26:04,439
- Go check the sons room.

936
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:05,892
- Okay.

937
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,242
- Come here, please.

938
01:27:29,168 --> 01:27:30,413
- Putain!

939
01:27:31,338 --> 01:27:32,748
Is it an obsession with you?

940
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:34,331
- What?

941
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:35,963
- Never

942
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,507
- I must find out.

943
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:44,635
Tell me why my father...

944
01:27:44,894 --> 01:27:46,852
...Finds himself in prison because
of the KGB, why these guys...

945
01:27:47,106 --> 01:27:48,849
...dig into our affairs.

946
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:50,567
What the hell is going on?

947
01:27:51,403 --> 01:27:53,194
- When was he arrested?

948
01:27:53,738 --> 01:27:55,695
Why? How is he?

949
01:27:58,411 --> 01:27:59,573
- Answer me.

950
01:28:00,871 --> 01:28:02,201
- Putain!

951
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:05,250
- Answer my question!

952
01:28:09,506 --> 01:28:10,421
- Igor...

953
01:28:13,512 --> 01:28:15,421
You know nothing about your father.

954
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,841
- I want to show you something.

955
01:30:01,806 --> 01:30:04,262
- The owner of the book
knows...

956
01:30:04,892 --> 01:30:07,134
...That you can not
give it back soon.

957
01:30:12,276 --> 01:30:13,900
Mlle Jessica Zimmermann.

958
01:30:14,153 --> 01:30:17,819
An uneventful file.
Today Ms. Wheat was married...

959
01:30:18,074 --> 01:30:18,739
...to Pierre Froment...

960
01:30:18,992 --> 01:30:22,112
...two children, move into
the French Residence

961
01:30:28,252 --> 01:30:29,248
- What...

962
01:30:29,505 --> 01:30:31,164
...This story in poetry...

963
01:30:31,674 --> 01:30:33,547
...in your handwriting...

964
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,462
In Russian and French?

965
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,675
What's this?
- I took this book these people had...

966
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:42,384
...during a literary evening
put on by the French Institute.

967
01:30:43,395 --> 01:30:46,481
I liked this poem: "The death of the wolf".

968
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:51,398
I had an idea that, with these verses,
I could create...

969
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,229
...a code.

970
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:58,369
A brilliant new code.

971
01:30:58,622 --> 01:31:00,116
- Are you kidding us!

972
01:31:02,501 --> 01:31:04,744
- Want to save time, right?

973
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:07,922
I have lots of time.
You'll tell me everything!

974
01:31:11,637 --> 01:31:13,215
- "The Covenant Cities...

975
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:16,427
...is the name I gave
to my syntax.

976
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:24,109
"Never enter into a
pact in the cities...

977
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,278
..."as man did...

978
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,987
..."in bonding with domestic animals. "

979
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:41,918
- At 8:15 this morning
he left on foot, alone.

980
01:31:42,256 --> 01:31:45,461
His wife needed the car,
so he took the subway...

981
01:31:45,718 --> 01:31:47,546
...and promised to return by 19h.

982
01:31:47,888 --> 01:31:49,050
- You followed?

983
01:31:49,306 --> 01:31:53,600
- All reports are formal,
there is nothing in the French.

984
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:55,308
- - And his wife?

985
01:31:56,857 --> 01:31:59,727
- Around 9 am, she left
with children in the car.

986
01:31:59,986 --> 01:32:02,941
She was buying clothes
for the children.

987
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:05,774
- Did you notice anyone following you?
- No.

988
01:32:06,326 --> 01:32:09,660
We got rid of the Lada
because of no staff.

989
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:13,365
- Then voila!

990
01:32:15,254 --> 01:32:18,255
The airport is your last chance.

991
01:32:18,923 --> 01:32:21,546
You will see
if the French are leaving!

992
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:25,635
- They had called. The device
is in place. They won't fly it.

993
01:32:25,974 --> 01:32:27,600
- He has promised
back at 19h.

994
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:29,097
- I am the skin...

995
01:32:30,021 --> 01:32:30,886
...If they spin.

996
01:32:35,277 --> 01:32:36,736
- "I'm skin... "

997
01:33:15,365 --> 01:33:18,367
- Everything will be alright.
Don't worry. Where you going?

998
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:19,782
Come back!

999
01:33:23,124 --> 01:33:25,283
Stay the in same lines.
don't move!

1000
01:33:57,123 --> 01:33:59,448
Never anything at the airport.

1001
01:34:01,294 --> 01:34:03,536
They are stashed somewhere.

1002
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:06,124
They are playing hide and seek.

1003
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,058
- By the road!
- What?

1004
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,054
- They are heading
to the Finnish border!

1005
01:34:20,317 --> 01:34:22,143
- 800 km to the north?

1006
01:34:22,402 --> 01:34:25,986
Would you leave in mid-winter
with two children in the back?

1007
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,569
- I don't have any children.

1008
01:34:33,415 --> 01:34:34,494
- Your papers.

1009
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:36,450
- Good evening.

1010
01:35:04,744 --> 01:35:06,488
- Where are you going
and why?

1011
01:35:06,745 --> 01:35:07,659
- Alexe. i.!

1012
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:09,999
- Don't move!

1013
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,578
- Alexe. i.!

1014
01:36:13,615 --> 01:36:15,360
- Your license is not signed.

1015
01:36:15,618 --> 01:36:17,575
- It's true! I will do it.

1016
01:36:18,288 --> 01:36:19,487
What happened?

1017
01:36:19,747 --> 01:36:21,788
- Someone has been trying to
cross the border.

1018
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:25,081
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, goodbye.

1019
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:45,649
- Stop!

1020
01:36:48,491 --> 01:36:50,780
- Stop!

1021
01:36:52,036 --> 01:36:52,902
Thank you

1022
01:36:53,412 --> 01:36:54,077
- Go ahead.

1023
01:37:38,549 --> 01:37:40,008
The door opens.

1024
01:37:48,477 --> 01:37:51,230
The cubs have fled. Saved.

1025
01:37:55,319 --> 01:37:58,605
- Igor and Natasha knew nothing.

1026
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,900
Absolutely nothing!

1027
01:38:01,659 --> 01:38:02,940
Anyway...

1028
01:38:03,286 --> 01:38:07,416
...Natasha had never accepted it.

1029
01:38:08,835 --> 01:38:10,293
She hates lying.

1030
01:38:10,753 --> 01:38:12,413
You know very well.

1031
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:14,131
- Let's stick to facts.

1032
01:38:16,385 --> 01:38:18,877
- I do not want to die
like the others...

1033
01:38:20,097 --> 01:38:21,889
...shot in the neck.

1034
01:38:22,976 --> 01:38:24,767
- It is not for you to decide.

1035
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:27,104
- Of course it does.

1036
01:38:29,025 --> 01:38:30,056
Nothing...

1037
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,735
...As never before,
for a long night comes.

1038
01:38:34,072 --> 01:38:37,277
Without sacrifice
change is not possible.

1039
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:41,781
The country needs change
to survive.

1040
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,579
- The country will change
thanks to you, Serge.

1041
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:48,711
Apart from your statue at the Kremlin
do you want anything else?

1042
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:10,816
- Thank you for coming, Igor.

1043
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:17,077
I think...

1044
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:20,582
...All these times
when I wanted to chat with you...

1045
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,786
...But you,
you locked yourself in your room.

1046
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,500
- And now...
- Stop Daddy

1047
01:39:29,387 --> 01:39:31,713
What will happen,
now?

1048
01:39:31,974 --> 01:39:35,177
- Everything will change.
The world will change.

1049
01:39:35,644 --> 01:39:37,223
It will not be easy...

1050
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,648
...but you are young, intelligent.

1051
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,985
You'll find your place.

1052
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:51,200
- Dad... for you.
What will happen to you?

1053
01:39:52,706 --> 01:39:55,625
We will make arrangements with Gorbachev...

1054
01:39:56,794 --> 01:39:57,957
...and others.

1055
01:39:59,673 --> 01:40:00,621
We found...

1056
01:40:00,883 --> 01:40:02,461
...a common ground.

1057
01:40:02,718 --> 01:40:03,548
- Are you sure?

1058
01:40:16,901 --> 01:40:18,016
- Yes.

1059
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:30,912
- Separate them!

1060
01:40:33,379 --> 01:40:35,538
- Get him out of here soon!

1061
01:40:39,886 --> 01:40:40,551
- Papa!

1062
01:40:40,804 --> 01:40:41,670
- My son!

1063
01:41:23,938 --> 01:41:25,480
Please.

1064
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:37,609
- The free world owes you a lot,
Mr. Froment.

1065
01:41:38,788 --> 01:41:41,031
He doesn't know,
and he must...

1066
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:43,166
...especially not learn that I...

1067
01:41:44,588 --> 01:41:47,957
For then, he would discover
that almost all...

1068
01:41:48,217 --> 01:41:50,887
Western strategic places...

1069
01:41:51,136 --> 01:41:54,387
Were known to the Russians,
for a long time.

1070
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:57,392
People lose confidence
in their institutions.

1071
01:41:57,645 --> 01:42:01,346
No democracy can exist
without the confidence of its people

1072
01:42:02,733 --> 01:42:03,648
None.

1073
01:42:06,571 --> 01:42:08,694
- Trade Grigoriev and his family.

1074
01:42:09,574 --> 01:42:11,533
That's all I ask.

1075
01:42:12,662 --> 01:42:15,616
He won't say a word,
I know him well.

1076
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,281
And he must...

1077
01:42:17,543 --> 01:42:19,251
...Much, no?

1078
01:42:19,628 --> 01:42:24,208
- Such an operation has no
chance of seeing the light of day.

1079
01:42:29,849 --> 01:42:31,557
- You're making fun of people.

1080
01:42:32,393 --> 01:42:35,229
You railed against
the Western democracies...

1081
01:42:36,565 --> 01:42:40,101
...But you let a man die
because it suits you.

1082
01:42:41,153 --> 01:42:42,233
I understand.

1083
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:45,405
If Grigoriev speaks on this side of the wall

1084
01:42:45,658 --> 01:42:46,739
...You will be thrown out.

1085
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:50,905
Grigoriev didn't try
to save himself.

1086
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,210
He has a little more class.

1087
01:43:01,386 --> 01:43:02,417
- Come here.

1088
01:43:04,682 --> 01:43:05,464
Come.

1089
01:43:11,606 --> 01:43:13,646
This man called Shukhov.

1090
01:43:14,235 --> 01:43:16,642
Head of the KGB.

1091
01:43:18,072 --> 01:43:22,533
We then transferred the entries taken from
this NATO database.

1092
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,360
He has been working for us since '78.

1093
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:31,289
We approached him
when he was stationed in Ottawa.

1094
01:43:31,546 --> 01:43:36,090
He was disappointed with the Soviet system,
Brezhnev and his cronies.

1095
01:43:36,343 --> 01:43:39,013
The perfect profile.

1096
01:43:39,472 --> 01:43:40,587
Like Grigoriev...

1097
01:43:41,015 --> 01:43:43,222
...But with a Swiss bank account.

1098
01:43:43,477 --> 01:43:47,392
He taught us nothing
that was very interesting...

1099
01:43:47,648 --> 01:43:50,104
...But last Christmas,
everything changed.

1100
01:43:50,568 --> 01:43:54,483
On December 24,
He tried to resume his affair...

1101
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,898
...With the wife of Grigoriev
at his place of work.

1102
01:43:57,159 --> 01:43:58,702
It failed. He was dejected...

1103
01:43:58,954 --> 01:44:03,200
...he left the military museum
and saw Grigoriev in the park.

1104
01:44:05,044 --> 01:44:06,704
with you, M. Froment.

1105
01:44:06,963 --> 01:44:09,418
From that moment on, we knew...

1106
01:44:09,966 --> 01:44:11,342
...What Farewell was.

1107
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,548
how he operated,
disregarding...

1108
01:44:14,805 --> 01:44:18,637
...elementary rules of espionage.
It was so reckless...

1109
01:44:19,144 --> 01:44:20,721
...it was above suspicion.

1110
01:44:22,731 --> 01:44:27,025
We asked Shukhov to arrange for the  Russians 
to find out who, Farewell was.

1111
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,279
The KGB had started...

1112
01:44:30,532 --> 01:44:33,818
...An internal investigation that seriously
threatened all our sources...

1113
01:44:34,078 --> 01:44:36,153
...of information.
So, yes...

1114
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:42,159
we gave them Grigoriev. It was
like throwing a dog a bone.

1115
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:43,452
Adieu Farewell.

1116
01:44:43,714 --> 01:44:46,336
In that way, we could save...

1117
01:44:46,593 --> 01:44:47,588
...The entire network.

1118
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:51,014
And we didn't forget you,
Mr. Froment.

1119
01:44:51,973 --> 01:44:55,806
The DST had no one the spot.
asked us to get you out.

1120
01:44:57,064 --> 01:44:59,519
On March 4, your cleaning lady...

1121
01:45:00,526 --> 01:45:04,856
...you gave a signal,
at the request of Lt. Colonel Shukhov.

1122
01:45:06,449 --> 01:45:08,738
...you managed to escape...

1123
01:45:10,036 --> 01:45:12,077
...having serious problems.

1124
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,746
Try to forget this story.

1125
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:24,257
It's better for you,
your marriage and your ulcer.

1126
01:45:25,054 --> 01:45:25,414
New York...

1127
01:45:26,556 --> 01:45:28,466
...is waiting for you with open arms.

1128
01:45:29,017 --> 01:45:30,560
East 72nd Street...

1129
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:35,100
...A few steps from Central Park
and French school. You'll see...

1130
01:45:35,609 --> 01:45:37,435
...the earth, life is sweet...

1131
01:45:38,778 --> 01:45:42,028
...For young affluent couples,
without problems.
