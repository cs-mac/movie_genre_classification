2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,830
Hm?

3
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,030
Makoto, throw the ball already!

4
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,020
Say, did you hear something just now?

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Did you hear?

6
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,730
Hear what?

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
Huh?

Executive Producer

Kadokawa Tsuguhiko

Here goes!

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,600
There!

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,490
Got it!

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,310
Yesterday...

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,100
My pudding...

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,710
I didn't get to eat it.

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,800
What's that about pudding?

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,260
Your sister probably ate it again.

Based on the novel by

Yasutaka Tsutsui

And I especially saved it for later!

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,510
She shouldn't have eaten it... Stupid sister!

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,250
Uh-oh, there we go.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,230
I did it again...

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,490
Big sis?

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,450
Big sis!

29
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,860
Huh?

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,540
Makoto! Makoto!

31
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,990
Up! Look up!

32
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,860
Up?

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,090
Ouch!

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,900
Get up already.

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,540
You did it yourself. I'm off!

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,940
Take care!

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,760
Today, July 13th, is known as NICE day.

40

Oh, no!

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,930
You're finally up, Makoto?

47
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,130
Morning, Dad.

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,270
Mornin'.

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,220
I'm off.

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,310
Makoto, wait, wait, wait.

51
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,020
What?

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,190
Take these to Auntie Witch on the way back. Tell her they're from Grandma.

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,070
I don't want to carry this stuff to school!

54
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,180
And also...

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,500
Ask her when she's finally going to get married.

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,410
Good.

57
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,920

Oh, Makoto.

73
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,550
You should give yourself some more time to get to school.

74
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,590
Like you're one to talk!

75
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,130
Slept in again, I bet.

76
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,960
Shut up!

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,710

You'd probably feel a lot better if you just came in late.

84
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,560
You're early, Kousuke. Did you forget to jerk off this morning?

85
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,550
Shut up! You guys are just too late.

86
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,570
I wasn't "barely on time". Look.

87
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,750
We're in luck today.

88

I'm in luck today.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,380
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,850
"When you're out of luck, nothing goes right". I thought that didn't apply to me.

91
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,960
Since I'm more lucky than not.

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,460
Okay, guess why the teacher was late.

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,920
A quiz?!

94
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,820

Still, I'm more lucky than not.

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,270
I have good luck and intuition.

98
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,310
Thanks to that, my marks aren't too shabby.

99
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,990
I'm not exactly smart, but you couldn't call me stupid.

100
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,920
Five minutes left!

101
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,400
Couldn't call me stupid...

102
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,590
Five minutes left.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,530

I'm not great with my hands, but I'm not clumsy enough to be laughed at.

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,030
I also don't make too many blunders that need to be erased from my memory.

107
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,220
What are you doing, stupid! The extinguisher!

108
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,570
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

109
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,570
Y-Yes!

110
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,720
That was also an exception.

111
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,280
Are you okay?

112
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,770
Singed my bangs a bit.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,570
I'm usually pretty careful, so I've never been seriously injured.

114
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,880
The same goes for complex human relations...

115
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,100
H-Hey!

116
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,290
Aw geez!

117
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,200
What the heck is this!

118
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,840
Why you!

119
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,030
I don't think blood-type fortune telling matters here.

120
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,180
But it says extremely bad luck. Isn't that risky?

121
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,530
She's the one who gets to decide if it's risky or not.

What?

125
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,000
Did you decide between sciences or humanities?

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,450
Not yet. You?

127
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,300
Nope.

128
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,790
That's good.

129
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,030
Can't make up your mind right away, yeah?

130
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,070

Hey, Makoto!

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,710
How long are you gonna be?

134
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,520
Why don't you help then?

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,970
Yeah, right.

136
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,860
Hurry up!

137
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,320
What will Chiaki-kun go with?

138
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,580
Probably sciences. He can't read kanji.

139
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,520
He's amazing at math.

140
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,540
And only math.

141
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,540
And why are we talking about him?

142
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,680
Hey, the questionnaires are still here! Who's on duty today?

143
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,670
Who is it?

144
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,900
You, of course!

145
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,110

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,940

A locked room mystery...

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,360
What's that...

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,630
You're such a moron. My stomach hurts!

153
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,340
You're laughing way too hard.

154

Yeah, you are.

155

156
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,650
It's not.

157

I'm fine.

159
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,710
Be careful. Something might happen again.

160
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,890
It won't. I won't have it.

161
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,630
But stuff doesn't usually fall on its own, yeah?

162
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,270
It didn't fall on its own! Someone was there!

You?...

168
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,190
So I'm the culprit now?

169
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,030
Then who?

170
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,590
Man, it's hot.

171
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,810
It's almost summer break. Hang in there.

172
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,990
That's right! Summer break! The three of us should go somewhere!

173
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,450
Like where?

174
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,730
Let's go to a night game.

175
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,730
We just went last month. You only have baseball in your head.

176
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,760
Where then?

177
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,930
Like the beach.

178
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,070
It's too hot.

179
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,310
Then fireworks. In yukatas!

180
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,580
I don't have one.

181
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,580
Kousuke, where do you want to go?

182
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,950
The library.

183
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,890
To study hard.

184
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,490
If you keep studying in this heat, you'll go crazy.

185
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,330
You guys slack too much.

186
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,420
We're not trying to get into med school or anything.

187
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,910
So what are you going to do?

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,420
A hotel tycoon.

189
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,710
Or maybe an oil magnate.

190
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,500
Be serious about it!

191
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,880
Say.

192
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,530
What are you going to do, Chiaki?

193
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,230
Me?

194
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,990
I'll...

195
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,600
You two should do some serious thinking.

196
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,750
Going home?

197
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,750
Gotta run some errands for Mom.

198
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,040
Don't be like that. You're leaving me alone with this guy?

199
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,500
Bye. See you.

200
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey. Hey!

201
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,580
Come on.

202
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,040
The dwarves are about to pop up!

203
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,690
Sheesh.

204
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,500
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

205
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm sorry!

206
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,970
If today...

207
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,020
If today were a normal day, there wouldn't have been any problems.

208
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,990
But...

209
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,480
I'd forgotten that today was an extremely unlucky day.

210
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,160
It's crazy... but I'm going to die.

211
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,940
This is it.

212
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,860
If I had known, I would have gotten up earlier.

213
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,050
I wouldn't have slept in. Wouldn't have been late.

214
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,030
Done a better job on my tempura.

215
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,090
Avoid being knocked over by stupid boys.

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,140
And today was supposed to be NICE day...

217
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,420
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

218
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,190
Apologize! Apologize this very instant!

219
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm sorry!

220
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,130
Do you know why you've got eyes on the front of your head? To see where're you going! Got it?!

221
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,240
Yes! I'm very sorry.

222
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,140
Honestly, sheesh...

223
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,720
Mama, look!

224
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh, it's already that late.

225
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,930
How...?

226
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,890
How?!

227
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,220
Yes.

228
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,460
Yoshiyama-san.

229
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,810
Don't be so anxious, she'll be here soon.

230
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,950
Makoto!

231
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,980
Auntie!

232
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,220
Auntie Witch!

233
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,590
Am I alive? I'm alive, right?

234
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,080
I don't look strange anywhere, right?!

235
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,410
Your bangs look strange.

236
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,230
That was a time leap.

237
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
Time leap?!

238
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,510
You were about to be hit by a train?

239
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,150
You were thrown off your bike?

240
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,880
But before you knew it, you'd gone back to a slightly earlier time.

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,610
Yes!

242
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,100
That's a time leap.

243
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,710
Time is irreversible, you know.

244
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,050
Irreversible?

245
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,330
You can't reverse the flow of time.

246
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,940
Which means that you were the one who went back in time.

247
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,990
You traveled through time and returned to the past.

248
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,960
Really?

249
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,270
It's not that rare. Many girls do it at your age.

250
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,120
No, no, no way. Never.

251
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
It happened to me, too.

252
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,710
For real?!

253
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,710
For example, on Sunday I would sleep in late.

254
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,960
And then I'd think, "I don't feel like doing anything today," you know?

255
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,130
And before I knew it, it was already night. That gave me a start!

256
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,100
Where did my precious Sunday go?

257
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,940
Listen seriously. I'm being serious here.

258
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,760
Aren't you glad you're alive?

259
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,160
Try to look a little happier?

260
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,630
Hey.

261
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,210
Help me here.

262
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,620
Yes.

263
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,090
Show me how you did it.

264
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,700
As if I could!

265
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,370
If you learn the trick, you can do it again.

266
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,220
I can't, I tell you!

267
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,000
But you actually leaped, didn't you?

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,290
Like this?

269
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,580
Yes. Hold it there.

270
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,660
What? Earthquake?

271
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,290
Big sis, no! Don't!

272
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

273
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,360
Why are you doing this? Because I ate your pudding?

274
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,110
Wh-Why what?

275
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,180
Big sis, don't die!

276
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,670
I won't.

277
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,540
Where are you going?

278
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,370
To the convenience store!

279
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,150
If you want pudding, I'll go buy it for you,

280
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,620
No need. Don't worry.

281
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,530
Are you mad?

282
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,290
I'm not.

283
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,520
You really aren't?

284
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,950
Yes, really.

285
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,520
Damn!

286
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,980
Awesome!

287
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,580
It's impossible to travel through time.

288
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,740
You can't just leap. No way.

289
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,450
I could never do something like that.

290
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,360
Here I...

291
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,410
...go!

292
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,910
Ouch, ouch!

293
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,690
Where am I?

294
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,170
Oh, back home.

295
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,800
Pudding...

296
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,090
My pudding's here. Which means...

297
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,430
Tuesday, July 12th.

298
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,060
Today, Japanese Standard Time...

299
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,330
Wasn't there some pudding?

300
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,350
Can I have it?

301
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,490
Isn't it your sister's?

302
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,290
She'll probably have something to eat with Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

303
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,750
I can? Yay!

304
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,210
No, you can't! It's mine!

305
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
Makoto?

306
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,030
You're home?

307
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,930
Ouch...

308
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,070
The pudding! Where is it?

309
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,670
Gone...

310
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,310
You saw?

311
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,340
Yeah, I saw!

312
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,800
Eh, what is it?

313
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,220
That girl just did an awesome jump.

314
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,280
She sure did.

315
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,870
And she disappeared for a moment.

316
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,170
How could she do that?

317
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,860
He's starting to tell tales again.

318
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,770
I'm not lying! I saw it!

319
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,960
Did I... leap?

320
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,650
Great!

321
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,840
This...

322
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,390
This...

323
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,550
...is not a dream.

324
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,670
I can leap. I can!

325
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,210
I'm off!

326
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,010
Take care!

327
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,340
Take care.

328
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,400
What time is it?!

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,220
Why?

330
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,230
So, why is today, July 13th, known as NICE day?

331
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,840
Good morning!

332
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,630
Morning!

333
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,990
Good morning!

334
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,710
Mornin'.

335
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,290
Morning!

336
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,460
Huh?

337
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,310
Barely on time again?

338
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,050
You'd probably feel a lot better if you just came in late.

339
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,950
You're early, Kousuke. Did you forget to jerk off this morn-

340
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,680
Stop babbling. Make sure you wake up early.

341
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,050
What? Why are you early today?

342
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,690
I'm done!

343
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,490
Takase-kun.

344
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,510
Let's switch groups.

345
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,210
Sure, but why?

346
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,570
Don't panic! Turn off the gas!

347
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,970
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

348
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,900
Y-Yes!

349
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,000
Takase, you jerk! I'll remember that!

350
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,900
Sorry...

351
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,780
Say, about Chiaki-kun...

352
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,670
I don't have time for that right now.

353
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,140
What?

354
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,630
Y-You okay?

355
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,500
Makoto, did you decide between sciences or humanities?

356
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,510
Maybe I should try going overseas.

357
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,150
What's that?

358
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,470
Like a student exchange or something?

359
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,910
What are you saying? You failed the English level 3!

360
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,160
Aw, come on. Time waits for no one!

361
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,190
Hey, Makoto!

362
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,600
Yo!

363
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,780
A melon soda and two colas.

364
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,210
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

365
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,600
We can do that after karaoke.

366
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,900
I refuse to follow a tight schedule.

367
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,020
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

368
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,500
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

369
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,880
Yes.

370
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,460
Your time is up in five minutes.

371
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,640
We'll be leaving then.

372
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,410
Time's up?

373
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,390
A melon soda and two colas.

374
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,330
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

375
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,130
What're you doing, Makoto?

376
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,120
Nothing.

377
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,260
Actually, I tripped.

378
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,690
Tripped how? And weren't you sitting here a second ago?!

379
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,800
Who cares. Sing on!

380
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:33,420
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

381
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,450
Yes.

382
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,120
Your time is up in five minutes.

383
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,830
We'll...

384
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,510
Yes, we'll be leaving then...

385
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,040
Not!

386
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,720
What're you doing, Makoto?

387
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,010
I tripped.

388
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,360
Tripped how? And weren't you sitting here a second ago?!

389
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,830
I'm not done yet! I'm gonna sing a hundred songs!

390
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,500
Ah, excuse me. A melon soda, a cola and a ginger ale.

391
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,550
I'm back...

392
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,700
What happened to your voice?

393
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,830
Karaoke.

394
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,150
How much did you sing to do that to your voice?

395
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,860
About ten hours.

396
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,490
Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,380
I'm beat... What's for dinner?

398
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,460
Chicken stew.

399
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,430
Let's do teppanyaki or something!

400
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,970
We had it the day before yesterday.

401
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,940
Come on, teppanyaki!

402
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,600
Stop moaning. How about coming home earlier and helping?

403
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,810
W-What happened?

404
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,390
Nothing.

405
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,370
This is it! Let's dig in!

406
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,720
How do you catch my batted balls?! Damn!

407
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,840
Yeah, how do you catch them with that form?

408
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,050
Again?!

409
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,850
How can you read my pitches?!

410
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,180
There's nothing I can't read!

411
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,260
I can see it all!

412
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,650
One person will win every time!

413
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,220
À Tes Souhaits? That's quite a treat.

414
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,570
Don't worry. It's to show my appreciation for all the advice you've given.

415
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,800
Even if I use up my allowance...

416
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,460
...I can just return to the day I get my allowance!

417
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,480
This way, I haven't spent a penny!

418
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,330
Really, I can come and go as I please.

419
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,410
I can sleep all I want in the morning, I don't have to go back when I forget something...

420
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,970
...and I don't need to finish a buffet in 90 minutes!

421
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,510
Oh, if you ever miss a TV show, let me know. I'll tape it for you.

422
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm glad.

423
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,510
Why?

424
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,950
Looks like you're not using it for anything important.

425
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,590
No way!

426
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,830
Time leaping is the best! I just can't quit.

427
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,810
Every day is so much fun! I can't stop laughing!

428
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,510
When you're enjoying yourself, doesn't that mean somebody else is suffering as a result?

429
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,760
Does it?

430
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,050
Who knows.

431
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,070
This is good.

432
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,800
It doesn't! It's fine. Whatever happens, I can just go back!

433
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,280
I can reset as many times as I want.

434
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,230
What's this? You've got extremely good luck today! You won't get another chance like this until next year!

435
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,120
You decided to do it today, right?

436
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,540
Break a leg!

437
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,260
What if she really does?

438
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,660
Senpai!

439
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,540
Me?

440
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,260
No.

441
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,310
Um, it's...

442
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,790
Kaho!

443
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,730
We're going!

444
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,580
Yeah!

445
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,690
What do they want?

446
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,290
Just go.

447
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,000
Stop throwing like a girl!

448
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,020
Throw with your shoulder. Your shoulder!

449
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,790
Hey.

450
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,370
You're late!

451
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,790
Sorry.

452
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,320
Um...

453
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,010
Those girls? Underclassmen from the volunteer club.

454
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,250
What'd they want?

455
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,610
Well...

456
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,890
They asked if we're dating.

457
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,390
We're not, right?

458
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,600
That's what I said.

459
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,480
And? What then?

460
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm not really sure...

461
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,850
...but I guess I was asked out.

462
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,380
Way to go!

463
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,410
For real?!

464
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,260
So what'd you say?

465
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,560
"I can't".

466
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,480
How mean!

467
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,780
Hey now!

468
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,330
After she confessed?!

469
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,560
Why'd you turn her down?! I'd definitely date her!

470
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,850
Listen here...

471
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,300
Doesn't she look like the girl you liked in junior high?

472
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,910
She doesn't!

473
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,070
It'll be too late if you change your mind later!

474
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,190
Stop talking about it already.

475
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,440
Bye.

476
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,380
Yeah.

477
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,970
Hm? Where's your bike?

478
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,020
A little something...

479
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,830
Hop on the back.

480
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,060
You're giving me a ride? Lucky!

481
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,020
I wonder if he's really not interested.

482
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,010
When he says no, he means it.

483
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,860
I'm a bit relieved.

484
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,870
Why?

485
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,240
If he got a girlfriend, he would take good care about her.

486
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,640
That's how he is.

487
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,790
Then he couldn't play baseball.

488
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,450
You can't call catch playing baseball...

489
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,390
Somehow I thought the three of us would be together forever...

490
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,840
Kousuke would scold me for being late, and you would make fun of me for not catching the ball...

491
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,100
Makoto.

492
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,300
Want to...

493
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,580
...go out with me?

494
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,750
Stop.

495
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,220
Stop for a sec.

496
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,620
What's that?

497
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,780
What did you just say?

498
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,850
Let's go out.

499
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,730
Where did this come from?

500
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,580
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

501
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,740
I'm... not that ugly, right?

502
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,590
You serious?

503
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,660
Serious.

504
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,460
W-W-Wait a minute!

505
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,980
What is it now?

506
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,540
Makoto?

507
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,400
What the hell are you doing?

508
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,070
Nothing.

509
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,830
It'll be too late if you change your mind later!

510
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,680
Stop talking about it already.

511
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,120
Bye.

512
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,140
Yeah.

513
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,830
Hm? Where's your bike?

514
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,560
Hop on the back.

515
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,650
That Kousuke beat me to it!

516
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,590
It's not like he actually got a girlfriend.

517
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,950
That's what you say now, but once he gets a girl, he'll put her first.

518
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,470
You can't be sure.

519
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,280
Damn, with him gone, we can only play catch.

520
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,430
Like I said, why don't hold off on the speculating until he actually gets a girlfriend?

521
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,000
Maybe it would be for the best.

522
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,030
In that case... want to go out?

523
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,110
Where did this-

524
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,700
That's what you say now, but once he gets a girl, he'll put her first.

525
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,580
B-By the way, my sister is such an idiot!

526
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm talking about Kousuke!

527
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,550
Let's talk about my sister!

528
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
If Kousuke got a girlfriend...

529
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,470
My sister was-

530
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,300
Want to date me?!

531
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,900
It'll be too late if you change your mind later.

532
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,510
Stop talking about it already.

533
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,270
Huh? Makoto, get on.

534
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:54,940
I'm fine.

535
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,440
Hey, what's with you all of a sudden?

536
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,380
What's with her?

537
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,890
Must be your fault!

538
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,870
Why?!

539
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,640
I thought that you liked Chiaki-kun.

540
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,020
You think that you have to take care of him since he's a joker, right?

541
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,030
Well, I did say that before, but...

542
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,050
Why did you undo it? You could just go out with him.

543
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,380
No, no, no, no.

544
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
Why?

545
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,350
I totally can't imagine being anything but friends with Chiaki.

546
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,130
If it didn't work out, you could just go back to before you started going out.

547
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,940
You can do that, right?

548
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,710
There's no need for that.

549
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,650
It's also possible to fall in love after you've been confessed to.

550
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,530
That'll NEVER happen!

551
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,640
Yes... Because you undid it.

552
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,030
Poor Chiaki... He worked so hard to tell you how he felt.

553
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,590
But he has no idea, huh?

554
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,490
Chiaki-kun transferred to our school this spring, right?

555
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,770
He went through a bunch of schools, right?

556
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,730
Sounds like it.

557
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,230
Is it true that he returned from abroad?

558
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,370
Nope.

559
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,990
He's too dumb.

560
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,770
So it's not...

561
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,520
Totally.

562
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,010
I wonder if something happened at his previous school.

563
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,580
Why don't you ask him?

564
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,170
I don't know his e-mail.

565
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,830
You're in the same class!

566
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,170
You're such good friends with him.

567
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,030
I'm not gonna ask that.

568
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,030
And we're not that close.

569
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,860
Liar.

570
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,520
Nuh-uh, I tell you.

571
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,040
Stop it!

572
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,460
They're getting him back for the extinguisher.

573
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,300
Stop that!

574
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,930
Who is it?

575
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,430
It's Mamiya!

576
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,790
Not done yet?

577
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,470
See you, Takase!

578
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,450
Bye!

579
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,350
Man, you're dripping wet.

580
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,950
Takase-kun, are you all right?

581
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,610
Yesterday they splashed cola on me, so I returned the favor with some coffee milk.

582
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,670
If you do that, they'll keep bullying you, right?

583
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,130
Hey, Makoto!

584
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,670
Did you see yesterday's nighter? Saito puts on some mad pressure!

585
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,930
You looked away just now.

586
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,240
I didn't.

587
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,140
What are you up to?

588
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,160
Nothing.

589
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,930
Just spit it out. What are you up to?

590
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,560
I said nothing!

591
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,060
What's wrong?

592
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,240
Konno, you...

593
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,670
Why did you ask me to fry tempura that time?!

594
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,360
Ah, no... I couldn't have known that...

595
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,080
It's your fault, stupid!

596
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,790
Who's stupid? Keep complaining and I'll throw this!

597
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,670
Hey!

598
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,040
Yeah, throw it!

599
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,950
Sorry, it sorta slipped.

600
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,310
Stupid!

601
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,680
What a rude guy. Calling others stupid?

602
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,180
You call me stupid all the time.

603
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,890
In my case, it's a term of endearment.

604
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,360
Come on, where's the comeback? Don't leave me hangin'.

605
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,650
Isn't she out of sorts today? Don't you think, Hayakawa-san?

606
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,880
You are absolutely right.

607
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,860
Why so formal?

608
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,660
Ah, well, we haven't really talked much...

609
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,760
Makoto!

610
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,070
She's not here.

611
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,920
Why isn't she?

612
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,820
Did something happen?

613
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,420
No, nothing.

614
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,720
You probably pissed her off over something stupid.

615
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,920
Don't say she has huge feet or whatever. She's sensitive about it.

616
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,370
I said nothing happened!

617
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,150
Nothing!

618
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,810
Nothing, right?

619
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,880
Throw it already!

620
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,240
I can't throw while I'm thinking!

621
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,680
No good.

622
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,080
I don't get it!

623
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,910
Oh, it's from Yuri.

624
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,610
[ Today something really great happened! What should I do? ]

625
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,690
"Something really great happened."

626
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,260
Something great?

627
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,900
[ What, what happened? Tell me! ]

628
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,280
Yes.

629
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,540
Wait a second.

630
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,400
What was that...

631
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,570
Hurry up, or they'll be sold out.

632
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,590
Today I don't really feel too well...

633
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,210
No way. Wanna go to the nurse's office?

634
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,690
No, I'm fine.

635
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,070
Hey, hurry up! That's quite a sight!

636
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,240
Stop it, Takase!

637
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,780
You're the ones who didn't stop when I told you to!

638
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,340
We're sorry!

639
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,910
If you're sorry, then you shouldn't have done this in the first place!

640
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,150
This is dangerous.

641
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,760
Did anyone go tell the teachers?

642
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,340
Hey, look there!

643
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,840
Takase-kun, stop it! Takase-kun!

644
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,090
Konno!

645
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,470
You just gave me an order, didn't you?!

646
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,470
I-I didn't!

647
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,300
You did!

648
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,870
What?

649
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,220
Why? Damn, dammit!

650
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,790
Damn it all!

651
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,330
Stop it!

652
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,070
Takase!

653
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,620
S-S-Sto-

654
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,450
Takase!

655
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,510
Chiaki!

656
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,260
Chiaki!

657
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,730
Whoa, that was a really bad sound.

658
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,710
What year are you in?

659
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,900
Quickly, get a teacher!

660
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,640
Where's a teacher?

661
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,730
I'm not my fault! I... I...!

662
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,040
Yuri! Yuri?

663
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,210
Are you all right?!

664
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,930
Don't cry. It's not that serious.

665
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,480
What if it leaves a scar?

666
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,770
Then I'll do something about it.

667
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,770
Something?

668
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,360
I'll do something.

669
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,800
No boys.

670
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,890
Does it hurt?

671
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,940
Let me see.

672
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,030
No.

673
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,870
Just do it.

674
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,720
Thanks.

675
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,830
I'm sorry, really!

676
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,800
Why?

677
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,600
I mean, I'm sorry, really.

678
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,690
For real, who goes to a nighter on the first date!

679
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,280
Weren't the three of us supposed to go together? I was looking forward to it!

680
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,560
That's why I said I'm sorry!

681
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,110
Hayakawa-san was okay with a nighter.

682
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,870
So you're going out?

683
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,810
Of course.

684
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,360
You okay, Makoto?

685
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,270
For real?

686
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,480
I can't?

687
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,850
But yeah, Yuri-chan understands my hobbies.

688
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,900
Lucky you!

689
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,070
Hey, stupid! Look where you threw it!

690
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,400
I'm home.

691
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,910
Hm, where's dinner?

692
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,130
I'm making it right now.

693
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:22,920
Why?

694
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,440
Big sis ate everything.

695
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,340
Geez!

696
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,000
What is this? After he said he liked me!

697
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,140
I was about to die...

698
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,250
What is this?

699
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,360
Ninety?

700
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,370
Makoto!

701
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,590
Let me go!

702
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,340
We've been had.

703
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,510
Totally duped.

704
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,200
The world is full of lies.

705
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,180
Wait! Wait for me!

706
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,850
Hurry up!

707
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,240
We can only play catch like this.

708
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,460
I'm gonna drag Chiaki here tomorrow.

709
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,020
That would be unfair to Yuri.

710
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,120
If I tell him you're feeling lonely, he'll definitely come.

711
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,690
I'm not especially lonely.

712
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,160
He didn't go with Hayakawa because you turned him down?

713
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,380
I didn't turn him down!

714
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,280
Oh?

715
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,070
What's that "oh" for?!

716
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,470
Good grief.

717
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,990
Why don't you get a girlfriend?

718
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,390
If I get a girlfriend, you'll be all alone.

719
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,890
I thought you liked Kousuke-kun.

720
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,760
He's the one who always helps you when you're in trouble, right?

721
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,450
He's like that with everyone.

722
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,660
Go out with him.

723
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,230
How did you come to that solution?

724
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,420
You know... If it doesn't work out, you can just go back to before.

725
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,450
I'll never do that.

726
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,460
Why?

727
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,320
Playing with the feelings of others...

728
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,300
Is too cruel for you?

729
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:42,840
Isn't that what you've been doing because you wanted to try going back in time.

730
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,550
That's how you saw it?

731
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,430
I guess.

732
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,550
You're a witch.

733
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,170
You really are Auntie Witch.

734
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,970
This painting...

735
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,260
You noticed?

736
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,520
Yes, the one you've been restoring since forever.

737
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,920
It's a mysterious painting. If you look at it for a long time, you feel completely at peace.

738
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,070
We don't know its artist, or whether it even has any artistic value.

739
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:27,430
But... we learned one thing during the restoration.

740
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,170
This painting was drawn hundreds years ago in a time of war and famine.

741
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,080
Why did someone draw this painting when the world was on the verge of destruction?

742
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:26,680
What will you do, Konno? You're the only one who hasn't turned in a course plan yet.

743
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,050
Konno.

744
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,510
Konno.

745
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,840
Konno!

746
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,570
Yes!

747
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,120
Don't get carried away just because you did well on the test.

748
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,310
Yes!

749
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,870
Strange...

750
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,420
It was ninety the other day.

751
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,320
Yes, go ask her.

752
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,440
Um, but...

753
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,220
What?

754
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,050
W-W-Wait!

755
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,890
Whatwhatwhatwhat?

756
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,410
Konno-senpai, we're from the volunteer club.

757
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,690
We have a serious question to ask you.

758
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,380
I-It's nothing!

759
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,240
Lately, you and Kousuke-senpai...

760
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,040
...are together all the time, right?

761
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,760
Well...

762
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,450
Stop!

763
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,110
Are you going out, after all?

764
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,370
Are you?

765
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,800
Are you?!

766
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,910
It was back when I was still in junior high.

767
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:36,650
The volunteer club from Kuranose high school came to the retirement home where my grandma was.

768
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:44,150
Grandma really liked one of the members, and told me about him many times.

769
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:51,050
"He's a very kind and wonderful person," she would repeat again and again.

770
00:50:52,350 --> 00:51:00,350
After hearing that so many times, I came to like him even though I'd never met him.

771
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,060
What a beautiful story.

772
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:08,110
After I entered high school, I learned that his name was Tsuda Kousuke.

773
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,080
So stuff like that really happens...

774
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,200
But, as you see, she's very shy.

775
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,410
So we were urging her to act.

776
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,280
The other day we finally got her to confess.

777
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,410
Oh, the other day.

778
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,420
Kousuke-senpai said...

779
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,370
"I already have someone I like."

780
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,900
"So I'm sorry but I can't go out with you."

781
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,280
Oh, um, well...

782
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,480
It wasn't anything like that.

783
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,520
"Someone who's usually stupid got better grades than me."

784
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,440
"I can't afford to slack off, so..."

785
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,960
"I'm very sorry, but..."

786
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,190
That "someone stupid" can't be... me?!

787
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,080
And then Kousuke-senpai said...

788
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,860
...that he's not going out with you!

789
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,040
But what is it with you two lately?

790
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,170
It's like the total opposite?!

791
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,780
Please explain yourself!

792
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,560
W-W-Wait a minute!

793
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,750
I got it. I got it!

794
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,560
I'll do something about it.

795
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,850
Something?

796
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,600
Something...?

797
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,180
Something!

798
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,410
Ouch!

799
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,980
What's with her?

800
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,590
Um, it's...

801
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,160
Kaho!

802
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,090
Um...

803
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,280
Kousuke!

804
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,460
Huh? Didn't you go to the field?

805
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:57,670
More importantly, her grandma said that she's really grateful for your help in retirement house.

806
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,410
Way to go, Kousuke! And then...

807
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,150
W-W-Why do you know my grandma?

808
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:07,040
How? I, ah, met her in the bowling alley...

809
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,040
She's confined to bed!

810
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,620
Ah, not there-

811
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,380
Call me when you're done talking.

812
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,760
W-Wait, Kousuke!

813
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,800
One more try!

814
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,940
Ouch!

815
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,790
Um, it's...

816
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,980
Kousuke!

817
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,690
Huh? Didn't you go-

818
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,690
Wait!

819
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,020
First of all, you're a coward! Don't be jealous of my good grades!

820
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,850
And that's got nothing to do with this, okay?

821
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,830
Why are you popping out of nowhere to brag? And it's got nothing to do with what?!

822
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:55,530
Like I said, my grades have nothing to do with Kaho-chan liking you!

823
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,030
Y-You're wrong.

824
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,990
You're wrong!

825
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,790
W-Wait, Kaho-chan!

826
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,440
You're wrong, she says.

827
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,100
Kousuke, wait!

828
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,430
What?!

829
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,180
I have to start with something more basic...

830
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,160
Big sis, why are you messing around so early?

831
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,180
Went back too far! And I'm late, to boot!

832
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,660
Makoto, the peaches!

833
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,870
Peaches!

834
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,130
Good grief.

835
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,340
Oh-oh, it's a headlock!

836
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,810
No good!

837
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,260
What was that?

838
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,610
Awesome.

839
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,200
Don't look. Carry on!

840
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,020
You all, get away.

841
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,810
Kaho!

842
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,200
I don't really get it, but she said to come to the courtyard.

843
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,370
Who did?

844
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,810
Where are we going? What do you want from me?

845
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,080
You'll know once we get there.

846
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,150
Makoto...

847
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,160
Later.

848
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,200
I give up, give up!

849
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,290
"Come to the courtyard"... for this?

850
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,430
No idea...

851
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,170
Fly!

852
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:24,500
There!

853
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,630
Ouch...

854
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,590
What the hell are you doing?

855
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,750
It hurts.

856
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh, crap!

857
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,840
Can you stand?

858
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,790
Did you sprain it?

859
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,360
I'm fine.

860
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,360
No, you're not.

861
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,810
Kousuke-senpai!

862
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,220
Lean on me.

863
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,210
T-Thank you.

864
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,660
This is quite a development.

865
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,380
Could it be...?

866
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,900
It most certainly could be...

867
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,910
All right!

868
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,660
I feel like I did a good thing!

869
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,110
What is this feeling of happiness?

870
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
It changed again!

871
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,580
Ten?

872
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,510
Ten means...

873
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,870
One?

874
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,840
No one's here. Am I too early?

875
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,340
Here we go...

876
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,710
Excuse me! Can I ask something?

877
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,870
Yuri?

878
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,990
I thought someone was here...

879
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,410
Why?

880
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:06,150
I brought the questionnaires for you. Did you forget that you're on duty today?

881
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,960
Oh, right.

882
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,790
I knew it. Really, you should appreciate our friendship!

883
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:14,260
So, what was your question?

884
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,160
Ah, it's nothing.

885
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,830
I see.

886
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,940
Yuri...

887
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,950
You didn't see anyone on your way here?

888
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,350
Anyone?

889
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,520
No, never mind.

890
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,180
I see.

891
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:42,010
[ Looks like I got confessed to. Aren't you jealous? ]

892
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,430
Kousuke?

893
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,000
"Looks like I got confessed to."

894
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,950
[ I'm borrowing your bike. Tsuda Kousuke. ]

895
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,000
Sheesh, who do you think you need to thank for that?

896
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,000
[ I'm borrowing your bike. Tsuda Kousuke. ]

897
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,960
[ your bike ]

898
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,620
No way...

899
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,280
Ma...

900
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,950
ko...

901
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,970
to... there.

902
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,520
Where's your house?

903
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,710
Past the station in the south district.

904
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,430
We better drop by a clinic.

905
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,180
Our home one is nearby.

906
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,850
By the way, Makoto...

907
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,060
...on the way here I met...

908
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,460
...Chiaki-kun.

909
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,480
Kousuke!

910
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,160
He went home.

911
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,040
Yeah, holding that first-year's hand.

912
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,040
Gone!

913
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,380
Kousuke?

914
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,910
It's me.

915
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,360
Look, Dad, can you treat a sprain?

916
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,080
No, it's not me.

917
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,440
Yeah, now.

918
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,350
Thank you.

919
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,890
Leave your message after-

920
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,440
Damn!

921
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,680
What should I do? Go back in time?

922
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,820
But it's not like anything happened yet...

923
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,590
E-Excuse me...

924
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,350
There wasn't a bike accident here?

925
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,680
No... I don't think so.

926
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,110
Thank you.

927
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,190
Accidents are scary.

928
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,530
Kousuke? Where are you? Kousuke?

929
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,670
Chiaki.

930
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,720
Kousuke went home.

931
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,270
Man, neither of you came to the field.

932
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,960
Sorry.

933
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,970
I'm waiting!

934
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,780
Say...

935
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:46,930
I've wanted to ask you something for a long time.

936
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,730
Is playing baseball with me fun?

937
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:51,900
What's that?

938
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,830
I like playing baseball with you.

939
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,370
You sure suck for someone who likes playing.

940
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,770
All you're good at is brute force.

941
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:00,910
Better than being good at nothing at all.

942
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,220
What are you laughing about?!

943
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,950
It just feels like we haven't really talked in a while.

944
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,360
What are you talking about? We've been talking since morning.

945
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,400
Oh, right.

946
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:14,980
You're right.

947
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,400
Do you miss me that much?

948
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,980
W-What? Stupid!

949
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,280
It's a joke! Man...

950
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,780
Look...

951
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,800
I also want to ask you something.

952
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,760
What?

953
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,780
It's a really stupid question though.

954
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,970
What is it?

955
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,750
Well...

956
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,720
Just say it, come on.

957
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,010
Are you time leaping?

958
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,450
You are, aren't you?

959
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,400
Hey, Makoto!

960
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,140
Makoto!

961
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,250
Look...

962
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,180
I also want to ask you something.

963
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,560
It's a really stupid question though.

964
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,530
Well...

965
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:08,960
W-W-Wait a minute.

966
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,910
Let's talk about my sister.

967
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,010
Why?

968
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,260
You know, she's so stupid...

969
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,760
Hey there! I'm trying to...

970
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Never mind.

971
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,640
I'll be waiting.

972
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,860
How did he...?

973
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,760
Zero? So it really was the number of times I could time leap...

974
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,090
I wasted the last one on something stupid...

975
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:42,130
Oh, well. I know that Kousuke is fine now.

976
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,710
Yo, Makoto!

977
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,010
Let me borrow your bike a little longer.

978
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,620
Wait, Kousuke!

979
01:03:59,620 --> 01:03:59,930
Ko-

980
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,180
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

981
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,260
Apologize! Hey!

982
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,740
Stop, Kousuke!

983
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,240
Kousuke!

984
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,830
Kousuke!

985
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,330
Stop!

986
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,420
Kousuke, Kousuke!

987
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,010
Kousuke, Kousuke!

988
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,800
Is she all right?

989
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,420
Hey, she's seriously hurt!

990
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,700
Call an ambulance!

991
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,040
How did she...

992
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,040
Stop, stop, stop!

993
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,770
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

994
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:25,730
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

995
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,290
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

996
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,310
Stop...

997
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,320
Stop!

998
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,220
D-Did it stop?

999
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,990
So it really was you.

1000
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,390
Chiaki?

1001
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,120
What are you doing here?

1002
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,270
Where's Kousuke?

1003
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,150
Still home, I guess.

1004
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,670
But he just...

1005
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,560
Did... you do this?

1006
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,230
You can leap?

1007
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,630
You too?

1008
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,510
If I told you that I came from the future...

1009
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,590
...would you laugh?

1010
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,750
In my era...

1011
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:42,110
...they've developed a device which lets you go freely back and forth in time.

1012
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,770
This thing here.

1013
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,720
You use it to charge your body.

1014
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,030
I used this thing to travel to this time.

1015
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,460
But then, I managed to lose it somewhere.

1016
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,220
I was frantic.

1017
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,800
I looked all around and finally found it.

1018
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,920
In the science room.

1019
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,570
But it was all used up.

1020
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,280
But I'm glad.

1021
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,400
That an idiot got its charge.

1022
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:21,480
I was up every night worrying about someone using it for bad things.

1023
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,740
W-Why?

1024
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,410
Because.

1025
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,380
Because?

1026
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,570
Because there was a painting I had to see.

1027
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:43,210
No matter how far away it was... No matter where it was...

1028
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,760
No matter how dangerous it would be...

1029
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,220
[ A Picture of White Plum, Two Camellia and Chrysanthemum.
Currently in restoration. ]

1030
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,870
I wanted to see it.

1031
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,840
In my era, it was already destroyed in a fire.

1032
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,260
Its whereabouts before this era are unknown.

1033
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,640
The only confirmed record of its existence...

1034
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,860
...was in this time, this place and this season.

1035
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,990
You just want... to see it?

1036
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,520
That's all I wanted.

1037
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,250
I wanted to remember it for all my life.

1038
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,290
But...

1039
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,750
There's no point anymore.

1040
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,600
None at all.

1041
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,810
You can't go back anymore? Hey, what do you mean?

1042
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:46,670
Like I said, I can't go back to my era.

1043
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,030
But why?

1044
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:53,110
To go back and snatch your bike that Kousuke was going to ride...

1045
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,020
I used up my remaining charge.

1046
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,160
W-What will you do?

1047
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,790
There's nothing I can do.

1048
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:02,250
Why did you use it?!

1049
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,300
Shouldn't it have been saved for the right time?!

1050
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,370
It was the right time.

1051
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:13,810
You don't remember, but Kousuke and that girl died once at that crossing.

1052
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:19,760
A certain someone was crying with guilt, so I had no choice.

1053
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,040
I had to go back, but before I noticed, it was summer.

1054
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,820
Being with you two...

1055
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,820
...was too much fun.

1056
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,800
It was the first time I ever saw a running river on the surface.

1057
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:02,560
It was the first time I ever rode a bike.

1058
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:07,330
It was the first time I ever knew how vast the sky was.

1059
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:09,990
And above all...

1060
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,630
...it was the first time I'd ever seen so many people in one place.

1061
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,000
Say... Chiaki.

1062
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,000
Could it be that...

1063
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,270
...there was a connection between the painting...

1064
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,070
...and the future you lived in?

1065
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,730
Hey, tell me.

1066
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,680
I like this era.

1067
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,560
You have baseball.

1068
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,940
There's no more baseball?!

1069
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,510
Where are you looking, stupid?

1070
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,070
Stop goofing around.

1071
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,100
About that painting...

1072
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,170
About that painting!

1073
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,290
If you wait a bit longer, you can see it.

1074
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,000
It's being restored right now...

1075
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,050
Let's go together! The three of us including Kousuke.

1076
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,430
I mean, summer break is about to start!

1077
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,970
Hey, Chiaki. Chiaki!

1078
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,250
Sorry, I can't.

1079
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,490
I'm going to disappear tomorrow.

1080
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:20,650
W-Why?

1081
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,870
People in the past must not learn about time leaping.

1082
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:28,170
I've violated that rule.

1083
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,380
So...

1084
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,100
I won't be seeing you again.

1085
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,280
I'll keep quiet! I couldn't ever tell anyone.

1086
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,290
Chiaki? Where are you?

1087
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,980
Hey, Chiaki...

1088
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,180
Chiaki...

1089
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,790
Chiaki...

1090
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:50,660
You said that we'd go to a nighter together!

1091
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,590
Sorry.

1092
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:54,010
And you said that we'd go to a fireworks display!

1093
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,680
Really sorry.

1094
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,810
Don't you want to see me in a yukata?

1095
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,430
Sorry, I kinda wanna see that.

1096
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,480
Idiot!

1097
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,150
Chiaki!

1098
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,400
Chiaki!

1099
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:25,180
Chiaki, wait up! Chiaki!

1100
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:54,760
Why did Chiaki-kun leave school?

1101
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,490
I heard he got into debt, and the yakuza are after him!

1102
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,860
Really? Wasn't it because his parents got divorced?

1103
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,170
They say he's marrying an older girl.

1104
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,220
I heard she got pregnant.

1105
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,690
What, for real?!

1106
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,370
Hey, what happened, Makoto?

1107
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,190
He's not like that!

1108
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,370
Sounds like he stabbed the guy with a box cutter.

1109
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,720
I heard he beat him up with a bat.

1110
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,280
Or slashed him up with a knife.

1111
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,760
I said he's not like that!

1112
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,780
Hey, Kousuke!

1113
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,940
Hey! Kousuke!

1114
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:34,510
What's going on...

1115
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,520
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1116
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,960
Even though he liked you...

1117
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,630
Did he say that?

1118
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,290
It was plain to see.

1119
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,450
You didn't notice?

1120
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,450
Well, you've never been good with that stuff.

1121
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,640
Maybe that's why he didn't tell you.

1122
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:09,270
Kousuke.

1123
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,120
I'm an awful person.

1124
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,010
Someone told something important...

1125
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,350
...but I undid it.

1126
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,140
Why didn't I listen properly?

1127
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,690
Makoto?

1128
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,810
What are you talking about?

1129
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,040
H-Hey!

1130
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:12,920
Calmed down?

1131
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,410
Actually...

1132
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:23,510
I thought that you would stay friends with both Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

1133
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,500
Graduate without dating either of them...

1134
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,310
...and then end up dating someone totally different.

1135
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,710
That's what I thought until yesterday.

1136
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,170
But it's not like that, is it?

1137
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:50,450
I first fell in love in high school.

1138
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,770
We became really close as soon as we met.

1139
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,370
It was like we'd known each other since childhood.

1140
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,590
But it was over before we became adults.

1141
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:04,930
Why?

1142
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,970
The timing was probably bad.

1143
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:13,010
What is he doing now?

1144
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,840
I wonder.

1145
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,460
He said he would definitely return one day.

1146
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,010
Though I didn't plan on waiting for him.

1147
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,070
And so much time has passed.

1148
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,800
It didn't last long.

1149
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,570
A blink of an eye.

1150
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,590
But, Makoto...

1151
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,430
...you're not like me, right?

1152
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,750
If someone were late for an appointment...

1153
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,490
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1154
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:02,000
Makoto, watermelon!

1155
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,900
Father!

1156
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,600
What's with her? No food... Not even watermelon?

1157
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,070
It's a broken heart.

1158
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,780
No way!

1159
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,860
Miyuki, that was uncalled for.

1160
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:24,020
If someone were late for an appointment...

1161
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,750
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1162
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,480
Why?!

1163
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,240
It should have been zero...

1164
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,090
Could it be...

1165
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,070
Makoto!

1166
01:18:59,070 --> 01:18:59,880
Big sis!

1167
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,960
Don't do anything foolish, Makoto!

1168
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,210
Makoto!

1169
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:11,380
It's because Chiaki went back in time!

1170
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,930
kaerimichi fuzakete aruita

1171
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,930
Walking home and fooling around

1172
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:15,010
Then it should also apply to him!

1173
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:20,290
wake mo naku kimi wo okoraseta

1174
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:20,290
I was teasing you for no reason

1175
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,050
Oh, Mako-chan.

1176
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,190
Chiaki can also...!

1177
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:28,760
ironna kimi no kao wo mitakattanda

1178
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:28,760
I wanted to see different faces of you

1179
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,700
Here I...

1180
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,850
...go!

1181
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:36,890
ooki na hitomi ga nakisou na koe ga

1182
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:36,890
With big eyes and voice about to cry

1183
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:44,690
ima mo boku no mune wo shimetsukeru

1184
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:44,690
Even now it squeezes my heart

1185
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:57,400
surechigau hito no naka de kimi wo oikaketa

1186
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:57,400
I was chasing you in a crowd of strangers

1187
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,060
All right, no talking.

1188
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,990
kawaranai mono sagashiteita

1189
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,990
I was looking for unchanging things

1190
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,600
Who're you?

1191
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,930
No talking!

1192
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:05,720
I'm Tsuda, this is Konno.

1193
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,720
This is a transfer student, Mamiya Chiaki-kun.

1194
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,760
A girl?

1195
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:12,090
ano hi no kimi wo wasure wa shinai

1196
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:12,090
I won't forget you of that day

1197
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,230
Not a product of well-breeding, but let's get along.

1198
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,360
Makoto, come here!

1199
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,830
See ya, Makoto.

1200
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:18,170
toki wo koeteku omoi ga aru

1201
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:18,170
Some thoughts can cross the time

1202
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,410
Did you hear that? He used your first name.

1203
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:26,580
boku wa imasugu kimi ni aitai

1204
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:26,580
I want to see you right now

1205
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,530
Makoto.

1206
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,620
Let's go out.

1207
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:35,120
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

1208
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,200
I'm... not that ugly, right?

1209
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,310
Makoto?

1210
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,240
Are you okay?

1211
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,390
I wonder what Chiaki-kun does on his days off.

1212
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,780
He can't play baseball all day long.

1213
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:43,830
Yuri.

1214
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:46,600
You know, I...

1215
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,970
...have something I couldn't tell you.

1216
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,220
What is it?

1217
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,030
I...

1218
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:55,800
...like Chiaki.

1219
01:21:58,850 --> 01:21:59,760
Sorry.

1220
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:05,560
I see.

1221
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,330
That's what I thought.

1222
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,380
I passed him on my way here.

1223
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,820
Go.

1224
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,910
Makoto.

1225
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:24,110
Time waits for no one.

1226
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,730
Makoto!

1227
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:29,730
Kousuke?

1228
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,360
Where's Chiaki?

1229
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,000
Got tired of waiting and went to the field.

1230
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,620
He's quite annoyed. We better go quick.

1231
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,570
You're leaving your girlfriend alone? After all my effort...

1232
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,030
Girlfriend? Whose?

1233
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:45,140
Oh, right! I went all the way back...

1234
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,830
What are you talking about?

1235
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,600
Um, that's...

1236
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,760
Say, why don't you invite those girls to play with us?

1237
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,160
Go and invite them!

1238
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,140
What for?

1239
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,420
Because it's more fun with more people.

1240
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:08,320
Do you know them?

1241
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,250
Sort of.

1242
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,660
Also...

1243
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,410
If you want to use my bike, it'll be 5000 yen.

1244
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,370
Got it? Five thousand!

1245
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,550
Hey, what do you mean?!

1246
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:23,290
Say "Let's play baseball together", you hear me?

1247
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:25,890
And also...

1248
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,010
Thanks for waiting for me!

1249
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:32,020
Makoto!

1250
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,380
Look in front of you when you're running!

1251
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:36,860
Sure!

1252
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,860
You're late. Where's Kousuke?

1253
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,300
He's not coming.

1254
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,690
What's with him?

1255
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,980
Where did you find it?

1256
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,980
No... Do you know what is it?

1257
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,660
I do.

1258
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:21,630
Who told you?

1259
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,060
You did.

1260
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,480
I didn't!

1261
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,800
I couldn't have!

1262
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,840
You told me everything.

1263
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:31,300
About the era you live in.

1264
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,460
About this device.

1265
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,780
Everything.

1266
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,700
H-Hey.

1267
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:38,900
Like I thought.

1268
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,810
I'm glad.

1269
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,020
Where are you from?

1270
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,040
From the future.

1271
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,340
You can leap?

1272
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,480
Not anymore.

1273
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,670
So I told you that?

1274
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,120
And you believed me?

1275
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,340
What a fool.

1276
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,290
Maybe so.

1277
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,380
Did you come just to say that?

1278
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,750
Why did I talk... idiot.

1279
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:00,320
The painting... you can see it back in the future.

1280
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,760
It won't disappear or burn up.

1281
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:09,840
It will still be there in your era.

1282
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,270
I'll make sure of it.

1283
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,450
I'm counting on you.

1284
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,940
I had to go back, but before I noticed, it was summer.

1285
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,620
Being with you two was too much fun.

1286
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:34,140
That's not how you said it before.

1287
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,540
Then what'd I say?

1288
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,510
I'm not telling.

1289
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,860
Why?

1290
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:53,640
Come on, what did I say?

1291
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,390
Not telling.

1292
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:59,030
Tell me! I wanna know, yeah? Hey!

1293
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:01,840
It's a couple!

1294
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,530
A couple!

1295
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,380
A couple!

1296
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,540
Getting it on!

1297
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,660
Couple, couple!

1298
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,630
Shut up, idiots!

1299
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,640
Run away quick!

1300
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,090
Give my regards to Kousuke.

1301
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,980
And say I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.

1302
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,030
And also...

1303
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:35,950
Makoto.

1304
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,660
What is it?

1305
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:46,490
There's something I've wanted to say for a long time.

1306
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,580
You...

1307
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,240
Make sure you don't get hurt when you're racing around.

1308
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:05,540
You know, you've got a short attention span.

1309
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,100
Think some more before acting, okay?

1310
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,810
What the heck.

1311
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,400
That's all you have to say in the end?!

1312
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:16,140
Idiot, I'm worried, you know.

1313
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:23,840
Fine! Thank you so much for worrying about me!

1314
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,890
So hurry up and go!

1315
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,510
What are you mad about?

1316
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:28,920
Go, I said!

1317
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,580
See ya.

1318
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,420
See ya!

1319
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:10,540
Why is that?

1320
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,760
I'll be waiting in the future.

1321
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,940
I'll be right there. I'll run there.

1322
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,360
Makoto.

1323
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,070
Makoto!

1324
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:39,120
Hey, Makoto!

1325
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,740
Really, what's going on?

1326
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:55,660
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1327
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,590
And he's leaving school to study abroad all of a sudden?

1328
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,280
Don't make me laugh!

1329
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,260
I'm sorry!

1330
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:10,290
Kaho, it's okay.

1331
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,220
He probably decided on what he wanted to do.

1332
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,220
Did you hear something?

1333
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:17,620
Not really.

1334
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,860
Nothing.

1335
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:21,140
There!

1336
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,170
Sorry!

1337
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:26,430
Kaho, you have no strength at all.

1338
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:27,290
Good grief.

1339
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,210
I also decided on what I'm going to do from now.

1340
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:32,960
What?

1341
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:34,890
Secret.

1342
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,650
What's that?

1343
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:40,150
Maybe later.
