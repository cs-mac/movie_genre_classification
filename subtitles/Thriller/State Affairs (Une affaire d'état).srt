1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,404
Previously on<i> State of Affairs...</i>

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,405
There's a leak. It's out.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:06,473
You already know.

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,574
Marshall, you don't understand.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,376
Because I'm not read into the web of lies.

6
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:11,512
Because you are not the president.

7
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:13,280
This is money? I don't want it.

8
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:15,282
I'm undercover at TKG.

9
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:16,850
They were protecting Fatah.

10
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:18,152
I have eyes on the target.

11
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:21,021
Fatah is the real leader of Ar Rissalah.

12
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,223
The president is
ordering in the air-strike.

13
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,559
My signal will paint the targets.

14
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:30,464
Fatah has been playing
us this whole time.

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,439
Charlie.

16
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,975
It's okay.

17
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,043
It's okay.

18
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,782
When one can act...

19
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,751
One should act as a liberator.

20
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:03,197
It's over, sir.

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,998
Bellerophon.

22
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:11,405
Nick is gone.

23
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:16,043
There was no Sheikh Hakam.

24
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,815
Fatah invented him.

25
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,984
He built a bogeyman and...

26
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,652
fooled us all.

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,424
Kurt... Kurt Tannen?

28
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,726
Still inside TKG.

29
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,529
Putting him in there worked, sir.

30
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:39,266
They were protecting Fatah.

31
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,970
I think they tipped him off to our attack.

32
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,905
Is Fatah dead?

33
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,974
Dawkins is on the ground now

34
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,809
searching for proof of death.

35
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:52,479
They'll find Fatah's DNA,
but they won't find a body.

36
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:56,717
Because there's no
body to be found, is there?

37
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,586
This was his plan all along.

38
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,488
Does POTUS know?

39
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:04,258
She's awaiting confirmation

40
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:07,494
so she can tell the world
that Ar Rissalah is dead.

41
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,296
You have to tell her, Charleston.

42
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,164
She's a soldier and the commander-in-chief.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,566
She has to know.

44
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,537
I have to resign, sir.

45
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,506
To you. Now.

46
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,711
Because of what I need to do next

47
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:27,080
and what I don't want
coming back on the CIA.

48
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,987
No one ever died for a flag, Charlie.

49
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:39,927
They died fighting for
the people they loved.

50
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,196
Let your training track him down

51
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,998
and let your blood do the rest.

52
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,070
I need to speak to her now, alone.

53
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,472
She's in a press conference.

54
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,107
Good morning.

55
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:57,477
I am proud to report to the American people

56
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,912
and to the world

57
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:02,349
that the United States
has conducted an operation

58
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,117
that has resulted in the death

59
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,652
of Sheikh Ali Hakam,

60
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:08,455
the leader of Ar Rissalah,

61
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,657
and Omar Abdul Fatah,

62
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,026
his second in command.

63
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,996
They were brought down
by brave men and women,

64
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,732
some of whom lost their
lives in this mission.

65
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:22,336
Sheikh
Hakam was a ghost story.

66
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:27,841
Fatah saw how powerful the
specter of Osama Bin Laden was,

67
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,376
the fear he instilled,

68
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,711
the infamy he achieved.

69
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:34,448
So he created a bigger, better version...

70
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,283
One he could hide behind.

71
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,452
He manipulated us.

72
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,787
He let Hakam draw fire

73
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:43,957
so he could run and hide
and strike at us again.

74
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:49,229
Charlie,

75
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:52,165
I just lied to 320 million Americans.

76
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:53,734
And the world.

77
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,037
What do we do now?

78
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,975
We don't make a liar out of you.

79
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,644
And I keep my promise.

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,248
I've resigned from the CIA.

81
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:11,485
This thing with Fatah...
I need to finish it myself.

82
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,355
It's dangerous.

83
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,124
Yes.

84
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,760
But every time we try
to overwhelm with force,

85
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:22,662
he slips through the cracks.

86
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:23,964
I can find him,

87
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,665
and I can kill him.

88
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,315
There are only three people in the world

89
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,017
that have this number:

90
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,285
my husband,

91
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,987
the head of NSA,

92
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,455
and you.

93
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,593
You call me when it's done.

94
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:55,829
Yes, Ma'am.

95
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,534
Let's end this.

96
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:10,937

www.addic7ed.com

97
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,405
End of this merger, right?

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,874
$170 million worth of business.

99
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,743
I slam my fist down,

100
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,177
I remind everybody

101
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,613
we should be slicing this other company,

102
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,882
a-hole to appetite.

103
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,884
- Wow.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,187
Another merlot?

105
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,523
Yeah. Why not?

106
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey, that's, uh...

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,426
That's the horse head.

108
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,994
Isn't that, like, the terrorist thing?

109
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,995
Ar Rissalah?

110
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,298
It's actually a Pegasus.

111
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,933
You could say it's my spirit animal.

112
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,035
How about that drink?

113
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,170
Yeah, let's do this.

114
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,839
He's out there,

115
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,342
and I have to finish it.

116
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:54,278
You're listening to the worst
of your instincts, Charlie,

117
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,480
the ones that'll get you killed.

118
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:59,717
You don't have any idea
if Fatah is alive or dead.

119
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,286
You're playing hunches.

120
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,587
You're not Agency anymore.

121
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:06,457
You get rolled up on, you're gonna die.

122
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,059
Don't be so grim, Syd.

123
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:20,037
I gave you a dish and a keyboard.

124
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:21,872
The weapons are unregistered and cold.

125
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:23,207
Thank you.

126
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:29,513
Charlie...

127
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:33,984
Watch your six.

128
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,556
I want Burke jailed.

129
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,990
You want to jail a U.S. senator?

130
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,792
The man you put in charge of the commission

131
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,127
to investigate the CIA?

132
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:46,063
The same man who leaked an
illegally photographed image

133
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,332
from a top secret government black site.

134
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,500
I want Burke jailed,

135
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,535
and I want that un-redacted Senate report

136
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:52,937
on the Kabul attack seized.

137
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:55,539
Madam President, you are making
irreparable political decisions

138
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,607
based on personal grudges.

139
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:57,975
Do not grind this ax.

140
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,844
You cannot come back from this.

141
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,046
You will become everything
that they out there

142
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:04,081
are accusing you of becoming.

143
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,416
David,

144
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,251
I know this seems aggressive.

145
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,753
And it is.

146
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,888
But if we don't empty the
ranks of people gunning for us,

147
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,124
they will keep coming in hordes,

148
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,258
wave after wave after wave.

149
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:15,359
Ma'am, you push this,

150
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,261
and I guarantee you those
impeachment placards

151
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,397
will become billboards overnight.

152
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,632
Don't back away from the battle

153
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,934
because you think we won this fight,

154
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,935
because we haven't.

155
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,271
Yet.

156
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:30,174
I just don't understand
why she resigned, though.

157
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,642
No.

158
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:36,013
No, why wouldn't she tell us in
advance that she was resigning?

159
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,149
Did she call you, Maureen?

160
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:40,351
No. I called her.

161
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:41,619
And nothing? What?

162
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:42,853
Look, Charlie's gone.

163
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,955
I mean, POTUS cancelled today's briefing.

164
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,524
We're being shut out.

165
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,858
- Yep.
- Again.

166
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,460
It doesn't matter anyway.

167
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,262
The vests are still very much alive,

168
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,963
and we need to find and defuse them

169
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,832
before Ar Rissalah hits us again.

170
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:58,102
TKG shadowed the Bellerophon op.

171
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,905
I mean, ran with the Agency in real time.

172
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,907
This woman who contracts for TKG,

173
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,108
she's got a quiver of legends...

174
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:05,776
Melissa Anchez, "Emily"...

175
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:09,046
I don't know who or what she is, but...

176
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,382
she's trouble.

177
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,017
Anyways, a couple weeks back,

178
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,352
she came in as a walk-in at
the safe house in Baltimore

179
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,688
and gave us satellite
access into Ar Rissalah.

180
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,956
And she kept a backdoor open.

181
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,424
Yeah. One we couldn't detect.

182
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,525
She's good.

183
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,661
So the Krieg Group clones the Fatah op

184
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,029
to what... to poach him?

185
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,264
To protect him.

186
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,200
That's what TKG's doing.

187
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,935
Protecting Fatah.

188
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,036
There's no New World Order

189
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,072
without factory-fresh
threats against the U.S.

190
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:37,074
The Taliban are back to
their sandbox skirmishes.

191
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,909
AQ is fractured and leaderless.

192
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:40,911
Where is our next great threat?

193
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,780
Where's our Godzilla?

194
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,014
Ar Rissalah.

195
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,349
Ar Rissalah.

196
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,651
They created the problem;
they're the solution.

197
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,356
You stay in.

198
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,658
Mine everything on the TKG-Fatah connection,

199
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,827
and you get it to me...
Directly to me, nobody else...

200
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:58,295
In real time.

201
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,997
Real time?

202
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:03,834
Sir, is this operational intelligence?

203
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,469
I know Hakam is a lie.

204
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:09,106
And you know the only place
I would have heard that.

205
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,741
Charlie's wading into deep water.

206
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,710
I'll be damned if we're
going to let her drown.

207
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,144
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:19,116
I want to thank you for meeting with me.

209
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,619
It would appear that
congratulations are in order.

210
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:23,320
You got your guy.

211
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,055
Indeed we did.

212
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:28,425
But you're not here to
congratulate me, Mr. Gantry.

213
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:30,461
You went through some serious back channels

214
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:31,829
to get in here to meet with me,

215
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,765
so let's cut to what I
hope will be a short chase.

216
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,302
Our intelligence apparatus picked this up

217
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,603
three hours ago.

218
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,511
When was this recorded?

219
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,179
Impossible to tell.

220
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,481
Far from it.

221
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,316
You'll turn this over
to the CIA for analysis

222
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,617
and we'll determine a timeline.

223
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:57,154
I'm afraid I can't do that, Ma'am.

224
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,390
I wasn't asking, Mr. Gantry.

225
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,791
This is private property

226
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,027
held by a privately owned company,

227
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,662
and as you're on a bit of a tear

228
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:07,765
in the "trampling of
personal rights" department,

229
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,402
the last thing I'd be getting is legal.

230
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,771
What you're doing is treasonous.

231
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:16,974
What I'm doing is free enterprise.

232
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,342
With your permission, Ma'am,

233
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:21,979
I would now like to have a very
pointed conversation with you.

234
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,170
You just went on television

235
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:49,273
and lied to the entire world.

236
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,875
Sheikh Hakam was a straw man,

237
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,777
and from what my sources have told me,

238
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:55,579
there's a very real possibility

239
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,215
that Omar Fatah is still alive.

240
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,884
These aren't just black eyes
for your administration, Ma'am.

241
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,621
They are sucking chest wounds.

242
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,590
Mr. Gantry,

243
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:08,859
you wouldn't be foolish
enough to try to extort

244
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:11,228
the sitting president of the
United States, would you?

245
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,896
Never.

246
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,400
But I would make that president a partner

247
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:19,370
and a fellow keeper of secrets.

248
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,505
With the CIA under such scrutiny,

249
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,141
a third party such as ours

250
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,743
can render an effectiveness

251
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:30,047
unburdened by the gridlock of bureaucracy.

252
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:36,587
Are you asking me for a contract?

253
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:39,256
No, Ma'am, I am asking you

254
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,525
for a hunting license.

255
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,030
Excuse me, sir.

256
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:49,366
Buddy. Buddy.

257
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:50,668
I need you to wake up.

258
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:51,702
I need you to move along.

259
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:52,836
Can't have you here.

260
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,405
You can't sleep here. This is a mall.

261
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,973
Oh, my God.

262
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,142
I need a bomb tech dispatched immediately.

263
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,411
Sir, I need you to sit... I need
you to stay right where you are.

264
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,679
- Do not move.
- What is this?

265
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,447
- Get this off me!
- Please, please, stay there.

266
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,748
- Do not move.
- Get this off of me.

267
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:05,749
Please, sit down. Don't move.

268
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,051
Get this off of me!

269
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,942
Jared Bloom... excuse me, Blum.

270
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:18,944
36, twice divorced.

271
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,946
Worked as a marketing
analyst for Goldman Sachs.

272
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,547
AKA scum of the earth.

273
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,083
The woman has been
identified as Christiane Lender...

274
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,618
Sporadic employment history,

275
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:27,886
was a henna tattoo artist,

276
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,122
yoga instructor, and my personal favorite,

277
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:31,990
an amateur dream researcher.

278
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,192
I can see how Ar Rissalah
got their hooks into her.

279
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:37,362
The FBI task force is moving
on her last known address.

280
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,105
So Stacy Dover detonates in D.C.,

281
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,807
but she's an outright Ar Rissalah recruit.

282
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,342
- We would agree on that, right?
- Yeah.

283
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,878
Well, then James Wilcox
infiltrates the White House

284
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,713
to put an Ar Rissalah
tag in the Oval Office.

285
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:56,615
Yeah, but we don't know
what else he had planned.

286
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,518
Well, we know he wasn't carrying explosives,

287
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:01,119
and we know he killed
himself while incarcerated.

288
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,787
Like Ahmadi,
who also commits suicide,

289
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,122
and we have proof

290
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,291
that he either had a hand
in building these vests

291
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,425
or helped distribute them.

292
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,628
Okay, so then we got this Blum guy.

293
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,664
What, he meets this hot yoga
instructor, date at the bar,

294
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,999
she gets him drunk,

295
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,233
drugs him, and then, what,

296
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,269
moves him to another part
of the Minneapolis Mall?

297
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,737
She fits him for the vest,

298
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:20,639
bails, he wakes up confused,

299
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,974
messes with the vest,

300
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,809
and that's that.

301
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,478
Okay, come on. Look at this girl.

302
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,613
She's got to be, what, 90, 100 pounds?

303
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,015
Maybe 110?

304
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,883
You're telling me that
she's dragging this guy

305
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,285
through the mall, nobody notices?

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,519
I mean, it had to be a statement.

307
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,421
Guys, I have Charlie.

308
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:37,889
Secure line three.

309
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,758
Charlie, one of the
Ar Rissalah vests went off

310
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,092
at a mall in Minneapolis.

311
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,328
Some investment banker was
drugged and booby-trapped.

312
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:46,131
They don't have a casualty count yet.

313
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,899
Mo,

314
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,901
Sheikh Hakam

315
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,570
wasn't real.

316
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,071
He was a spook story

317
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:58,009
concocted by Fatah as cover fire
for what he was really doing.

318
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,879
Fatah is Ar Rissalah.

319
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:04,082
That's why you resigned?

320
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,117
Oh, my God, you're going
after Fatah yourself.

321
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,620
You guys have ears on all
the Ar Rissalah chatter.

322
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,422
Ping it back to every NSA listening station

323
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:11,523
in Afghanistan.

324
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:13,725
That data can be used to track him.

325
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,094
Why would he
return to Afghanistan?

326
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,964
It's his seat of power,

327
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,334
his safe haven, and it's
where all of this began.

328
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,902
He'll try to take credit for the bombing

329
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:27,105
to further trump Sheikh Hakam's ability

330
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,540
to strike from beyond the grave.

331
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:33,178
He wants to keep building
the legend of Ar Rissalah.

332
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,013
Which means detonating more vests

333
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,114
and killing more people.

334
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,582
Have Dash go into my office

335
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,251
and raid all my old files on Fatah...

336
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:40,685
Especially the Afghanistan ones...

337
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,786
And put together a hit sheet.

338
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:43,021
Got it.

339
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,323
And Mo, if you really want
to find the other vests,

340
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,792
there's only one person
you need to be talking to.

341
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,364
San Antonio.

342
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,933
I was going to meet a man named Mark.

343
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,534
You were gonna take the vest there?

344
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,769
Vests.

345
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,371
There were two of them.

346
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,339
The other one was going to Houston.

347
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,208
Mark was delivering it to a couple there.

348
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,676
And what were their names?

349
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,213
Al and Enid?

350
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,549
Al and Enid?

351
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,785
Feels Flimsy. Mark, Al, and Enid?

352
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,954
Feels fake.

353
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:17,922
Those were the names I was given.

354
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,664
What's in the Bay Area?

355
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,400
Our home.

356
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,401
This is our home.

357
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,203
These are temporary quarters.

358
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,506
I'm done with all this.

359
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,309
Done with all what, Marshall?

360
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:38,476
Our marriage?

361
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:39,477
No.

362
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,446
Your presidency

363
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,749
and what it requires of you to keep from me.

364
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,185
It's all so easy for you, isn't it?

365
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,689
The arm-chair critic.

366
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,991
Do you know what this
office truly asks of me?

367
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:57,228
The sacrifices that go beyond Aaron?

368
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,931
It's too much for me, CeCe.

369
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,666
I didn't know what I signed on for.

370
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,368
It's clear I don't have the stomach

371
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,870
for all of this right now.

372
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:07,839
You're right.

373
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:11,676
This is not the time for the faint of heart.

374
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,611
And if you can't stand by my side

375
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,680
when I need you most,

376
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:16,748
then maybe you should go.

377
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,616
I'm gonna go back to the Bay for a bit.

378
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:19,684
To the ranch.

379
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,619
I just need some time away from this.

380
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,322
CeCe, I'm sorry.

381
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,058
You'll always have my heart.

382
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:30,562
But there's a warrior
that has emerged in you

383
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:33,164
since you took this office.

384
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,502
And I don't know if she's
going away anytime soon.

385
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,088
Mo.

386
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:58,456
Charlie, we're looking at an overview

387
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,158
of the target cities now, and it's not much.

388
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,593
Despite Travers' capture,

389
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,161
we're assuming the vests still wound up

390
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,329
in San Antonio and Houston.

391
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:06,531
Assume it's personal too.

392
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,933
Assume everything Ar Rissalah has done

393
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,802
or is doing is personal

394
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,303
and run it through that filter first.

395
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,373
Because whatever the plan,
it's been well thought out.

396
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,079
Minneapolis is a
thousand miles from D.C.

397
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,214
Minneapolis and San Antonio are separated

398
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,216
by another thousand plus miles.

399
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,520
San Antonio and Houston
are only 200 miles apart.

400
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,789
Yeah, why two cities in Texas?

401
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:32,390
Why two cities so close together?

402
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,459
All right, Earl.

403
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:37,595
I'm booted up. You got me?

404
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:39,063
You're uplinked, Charlie.

405
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,132
You're seeing what we're
seeing, and I've got indexes

406
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,601
on both Bellerophon and Pegasus.

407
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,336
The targets don't seem random.

408
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:46,438
We're missing something.

409
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,039
- What else did Travers say?
- Nothing.

410
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:51,376
Names... the people he was
meant to deliver the vests to...

411
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,178
Other Ar Rissalah members.

412
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,280
- What were they?
- Al, Mark, and Enid.

413
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:58,283
There are more than 17,000
people in the San Antonio area

414
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,084
fitting those names.

415
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,587
And that's assuming
those are their real names.

416
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,522
Charlie, we don't
have the time or manpower

417
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:05,957
to canvass numbers like that.

418
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,559
- Oh, my God.
- It's just too many people.

419
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:09,694
No.

420
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,263
No, no, no.

421
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,866
It's not people.

422
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,401
Al...

423
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:17,402
Algenib,

424
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,270
the flank.

425
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,039
Mark... Markab,

426
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,240
the saddle.

427
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,708
Enid... Enif,

428
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:24,709
the nose.

429
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,611
Ar Rissalah's symbol.

430
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,446
The horse's head.

431
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,747
It's Pegasus.

432
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:31,749
Fatah's using it as a map.

433
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:38,056
It's the Pegasus constellation.

434
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:41,192
And its points will tell us
exactly where the bombs will be.

435
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,302
Lucas, where are we with the bombs?

436
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:09,804
We're in contact with law enforcement

437
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,838
from every city on the map.

438
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:12,373
Don't worry about the smaller cities.

439
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,407
They're not gonna bother.

440
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,109
Focus on major population centers.

441
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:16,544
Fatah needs this to be big.

442
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:17,678
Is Charlie uplinked?

443
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,046
She's online.

444
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,881
Charlie, I'm burst transmitting a hit sheet

445
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,183
of your Fatah research.

446
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:23,250
I had to rush through it,

447
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,885
but I think it's pretty tight regardless.

448
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,721
Guys, I've powered down.

449
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:28,122
I feel too many eyes on me.

450
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,223
Stay on those vests.

451
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,491
I'm getting out of here.

452
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,305
Madam President,

453
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,540
why did you hold a press conference

454
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,075
announcing the death of Sheikh Hakam?

455
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,376
Why didn't we just say that we got

456
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,645
Hannibal Lecter or the Joker.

457
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,247
Who told you?

458
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:54,615
That's your response?

459
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,150
As if I shouldn't have had the information?

460
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:57,118
Nobody needs to tell me.

461
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,085
I'm the Chief of Staff.

462
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,386
Just like nobody needs to tell me

463
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:02,990
that you had a meeting with Victor Gantry.

464
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:06,393
What the hell are we doing?

465
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,730
Victor Gantry's trying to leverage me.

466
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,633
He knows Sheikh Hakam wasn't real.

467
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,401
So what does he want?

468
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,103
He wants TKG to be contracted

469
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:19,106
to hunt down established terrorist threats,

470
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,141
starting with Fatah.

471
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,446
Ma'am, you've already come under scrutiny

472
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,281
for using the CIA as your own personal army,

473
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:31,652
and now you would hire
an actual private army

474
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:36,724
with dubious ties to the darker
sectors of the spy trade.

475
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,193
It's patently insane.

476
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:40,795
You can't trust them.

477
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:50,237
Where are you, Omar?

478
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,806
Where are you?

479
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:53,641
It's the desert nomads.

480
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,143
The Hindu Kush.

481
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,311
It's like they absorb him.

482
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,579
Anytime he wants to vanish,

483
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,748
anytime he wants to fall off the radar,

484
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:01,782
that's where he goes.

485
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:02,850
Those Bedouin caravans.

486
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,919
Why would he want to vanish?

487
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,191
Look...

488
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:12,793
Fatah gives us table scraps.

489
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,495
There's never any meat on the bone,

490
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,030
and when there is,

491
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,832
it feels like we're taking out his enemies,

492
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,200
not ours.

493
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,668
Yeah, I know.

494
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:21,669
I mean, I'm not saying anything

495
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:22,837
you haven't already thought of, am I?

496
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,004
No.

497
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,841
You're right.

498
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:30,010
Well, you say that like
I've ever been wrong.

499
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:42,256
I'm just looking out for you.
You know that, right?

500
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,357
Why?

501
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,529
Because I love you.

502
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:49,530
Chuck.

503
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,969
And no matter what,

504
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:56,770
at your worst moment

505
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,239
and your darkest hour,

506
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:01,175
I've got you.

507
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,044
And I'll see you before you
ever even know I'm there.

508
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,850
911, what's your emergency?

509
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:13,053
I can't kill kids.

510
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:14,221
Ar Rissalah.

511
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:18,525
I want to believe, but I can't kill kids.

512
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:21,128
There are two bombs in a
dumpster off of Durango.

513
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,633
Boom! We got two.

514
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:27,668
San Antonio PD picked up two vests

515
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,870
after a 911 call from the
alleged bomber himself.

516
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:32,973
Second vest was on its way to Houston.

517
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,775
Two down. I like that.

518
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,245
Now we need to go
a perfect five for five.

519
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:40,781
You could chalk
up my reaction to this

520
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:44,351
as pure partisan politics...

521
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,288
Paint everything with that brush.

522
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,290
But you'd be mistaken.

523
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,025
I'm not a supporter of Madam President,

524
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,927
but I wouldn't, as some would,

525
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:55,829
destabilize this country in
order to engineer her defeat.

526
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:57,698
Bob,

527
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:01,135
you leaked the Fatah photo.

528
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,603
A woman I was very close to,

529
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:05,773
the late Kyle Green,

530
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:07,708
was compromised by the Krieg Group.

531
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:08,909
Yeah, I know them.

532
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:10,244
What I found was,

533
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,480
this woman that I trusted implicitly

534
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,316
had in fact fallen from that faith.

535
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,051
Now, I was disappointed,

536
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:19,019
and I was heartbroken.

537
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:23,590
But you see, no one is
above betrayal, David.

538
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:26,560
The president would never
lay me out on purpose,

539
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:28,329
not like you're laying out Kyle Green

540
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,497
for leaking that photo,

541
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:33,400
which is what I assume you're doing.

542
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,604
You know, David, all this
contempt leaves me wondering

543
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,306
why you even bothered
to come here to warn me

544
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,175
about your boss's intentions.

545
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,879
Well, let me be clear.

546
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,449
I don't want this to blow up in her face,

547
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:50,117
and you seem like a shrewd enough operator

548
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,419
to keep your mouth shut.

549
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,755
She doesn't need any more
enemies in the Senate.

550
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,157
She sure as hell doesn't.

551
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:58,659
At the same time,

552
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:01,128
in politics, one should consider the future.

553
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,966
Eyes forward, David.

554
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:11,038
Ask yourself

555
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:12,906
where you want to be standing

556
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:16,477
this time next year

557
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:19,079
and who you want to be standing with.

558
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,984
Who do I want to be standing with, Bob?

559
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:37,698
This is Nick. You know what to do.

560
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,841
This is Nick. You know what to do.

561
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,985
This is Nick. You know what to do.

562
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:04,425
No.

563
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,160
I don't.

564
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,208
Hello.

565
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:16,443
You got a line on Victor?

566
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:17,444
He's at a lunch.

567
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,845
Any idea when he's back?

568
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,549
Oh, I don't know, I'm
guessing whenever he wants.

569
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,583
Okay.

570
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,926
You were right about
our listening stations.

571
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,127
We have a triangulation.

572
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:35,429
A lot of chatter back and forth

573
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:38,165
between Jalalabad, Lokhay,
and Rudat, Afghanistan.

574
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,166
Okay.

575
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,233
Fatah speaks fluent Pashto,

576
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,368
so it would make sense

577
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,503
that he would straddle the
Afghan-Pakistani border.

578
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,073
Charlie, it's likely he's
hiding out in the Hindu Kush,

579
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:47,307
which means Pashtunwali.

580
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:51,311
It means protection from all of his enemies.

581
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:53,080
Mo, can you get me sat images of that area?

582
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,515
Look for caravans, encampments.

583
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:56,850
Got it. Sending right away.

584
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:57,851
Thanks.

585
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:09,129
Welcome, Mr. Gantry.

586
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,170
Did my Kevlar arrive?

587
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,238
- Tomorrow.
- Oh.

588
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:19,339
Is Victor around?

589
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,407
He's at lunch.

590
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:21,808
Mr. Tannen was just looking for him.

591
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:22,909
He may be in his office.

592
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,482
They're not letting any dust settle on them,

593
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:29,716
that's for sure.

594
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,384
Hey, Dash, can
you upload this to Charlie

595
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,953
with terrain specs and GPS coordinates?

596
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:34,788
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

597
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:35,789
How we doing over here?

598
00:27:14,496 --> 00:27:17,497
Hey, Kurt.

599
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:19,232
You knocking off early?

600
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:20,600
You know, I'm a lenient boss,

601
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,235
but, uh, seriously?

602
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:24,337
Yeah, I'm just going to
meet an old agency contact.

603
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:26,640
Maybe pick up some back chatter, post-Hakam.

604
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:28,241
Kurt.

605
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:31,011
Whatever you're wrapping your
hand around won't be necessary.

606
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:33,480
I haven't killed anybody since 1992.

607
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:36,483
Not publicly, anyway.

608
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:39,186
What'd you take from me, Kurt?

609
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:41,655
Our mainframe has a tamper detection system.

610
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,089
It sends me a text.

611
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,491
So what did you take from me?

612
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:45,892
Let's not spoil the surprise, Vic.

613
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:48,662
Do you really think I didn't
know you were still CIA?

614
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:50,530
Pal, I'm positive you didn't know.

615
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:54,100
Kurt, we didn't target
you because you were good.

616
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:57,270
We made you a mark because you were easy.

617
00:27:57,306 --> 00:28:00,674
And this girl, with those eyes

618
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,642
and that ass...

619
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:04,211
A man gets lost.

620
00:28:04,246 --> 00:28:05,245
Do me a favor.

621
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,147
Plug right into the CIA mainframe

622
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:10,550
when you download that
data rip you stole from me.

623
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:12,419
Oh, I want to play poker with you.

624
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:14,221
Oh, buddy.

625
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:16,256
The game you've already entered into with me

626
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,959
is gonna be so much more exciting.

627
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:21,728
I don't think you have the reach.

628
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,663
Well, then like you said,

629
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:26,700
let's not spoil the surprise.

630
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:00,400
Charleston?

631
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,535
I'm close, Ma'am.

632
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:03,536
We're nearly there.

633
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:06,373
What can I do?

634
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:08,241
What do you need?

635
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,010
Nothing.

636
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,578
It's just odd.

637
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:14,414
What's odd?

638
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,619
You know how I told you,

639
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,355
when you asked me what I
wished for on his birthday,

640
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:27,160
that I never wanted to
lose that sense of Aaron?

641
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,529
That feeling that he was close by.

642
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:31,364
I remember.

643
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,767
Yes.

644
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:36,303
Well, I feel it now,

645
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:39,239
as strong as ever.

646
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:43,009
Then he is right there with you, darling.

647
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:45,312
And he will help you finish this.

648
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,317
You'll hear from me again, Constance.

649
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,252
I know I will, Charlie.

650
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:53,353
Good-bye.

651
00:29:58,493 --> 00:29:59,959
We're moving on the vests.

652
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:02,295
Task forces are launching in
all cities simultaneously.

653
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,965
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

654
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:17,844
We are your sisters.

655
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:20,313
We are your disciples and we are everywhere.

656
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:21,981
We've been waiting for a moment such as this

657
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:23,450
and now we have arisen.

658
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:33,026
Ah!

659
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:37,330
- Go, go, go.
- Fan out. Find the vest.

660
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:44,637
Ar Rissalah.

661
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:45,805
We are your brothers,

662
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:47,440
your sisters...

663
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:48,775
FBI!

664
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:54,214
They got the vests.

665
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:58,017
All of them. We shut it down!

666
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:00,220
We're not done yet.

667
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:02,088
Charlie's still out there.

668
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:10,096
David.

669
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,465
I assume you've been told
they rounded up all the vests.

670
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:15,935
This is an un-redacted version

671
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,804
of the senate subcommittee's report

672
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,540
on the convoy attack in Kabul.

673
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:23,209
It is the sole copy.

674
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:25,145
And it is now yours.

675
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,713
It's a final gift.

676
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:36,656
What's this?

677
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:38,792
That is my letter of resignation.

678
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:44,264
David...

679
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,299
When we started this crusade,

680
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:48,435
your campaign, we wanted to give the people

681
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,804
a president who had served this country,

682
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,007
someone who knew the honor and the sacrifice

683
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,976
of being a soldier.

684
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:58,411
And we did that.

685
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:03,483
And we weathered a hell of a storm.

686
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:06,920
And it's been my distinct pleasure

687
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,988
serving this administration
during that time,

688
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:13,026
but I think you should have
someone as Chief of Staff

689
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:15,695
who's like-minded.

690
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,030
And after a lot of soul searching,

691
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,364
I don't think that's me.

692
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,154
Look who it is.

693
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:44,321
- Kurt.
- Good to see you, Dash.

694
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:45,790
- Welcome back.
- Nice suit.

695
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,525
You look clean, brother.

696
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,859
I hate this thing.

697
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:50,394
TKG's treating
you well, huh, buddy?

698
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,595
I don't know how you guys wear these ties.

699
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:52,830
It's the worst.

700
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,270
You guys know, right?

701
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,372
Yeah, we're just sharing this
awkward moment with you.

702
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:02,506
Okay.

703
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,641
- We got read in.
- We know.

704
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:05,142
Yeah, that's affirmative.

705
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:06,310
What do you got there?

706
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:07,845
Logs, data dumps

707
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,480
of TKG shadowing the Bellerophon op.

708
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:10,481
Shadowing?

709
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:11,549
Yeah, you remember that girl

710
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:12,783
who came into the safe house?

711
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,151
That was their uplink
they sold us, wasn't it?

712
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:16,053
Yeah, they were hacked
into our monitoring systems.

713
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,888
Well, why would an American
company want to do that?

714
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:18,856
Money.

715
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:19,857
Greed.

716
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:20,958
To build a network.

717
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:22,493
A data bank of Jihadists worldwide.

718
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:26,263
Then they sell TKG's target/kill
capabilities on the open market,

719
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,232
capabilities which may now exceed our own.

720
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,600
Not today.

721
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,603
Today's all about us.

722
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:33,804
- Charlie?
- Yep.

723
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,972
- Mm-hmm.
- Solo?

724
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,974
There was no other way she
was going to finish this.

725
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:37,942
Well, can we help her?

726
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,243
We have.

727
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,744
As much as she would let us.

728
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,150
Well, I'm glad to be back.

729
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,651
Good to have you back.

730
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,003
__

731
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:10,794
__

732
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:12,849
_

733
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:13,672
__

734
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:14,795
_

735
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:35,326
Drop your weapon and get on the ground.

736
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:40,698
Get on the ground, Omar.

737
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,104
Are you gonna shoot me now?

738
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,605
Go ahead.

739
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm not gonna lay down.

740
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,042
I've fulfilled my responsibilities.

741
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:53,577
I gave you Sheikh Hakam.

742
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,447
You gave me a handful of sand.

743
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:57,715
You gave me shadows.

744
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,351
Charlie, we utilized
each other for a victory,

745
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:01,385
a common victory.

746
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,253
You used us

747
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:04,922
to rid yourself of your enemies.

748
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:07,191
Radical influences upending Islam,

749
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:08,959
threatening America.

750
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:19,169
Who was the man you identified as Hakam?

751
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,343
Huh?

752
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,911
Your president went on television

753
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:31,015
and told the world Hakam is dead.

754
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,349
What does it matter?

755
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:34,785
You got what you wanted,

756
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,986
and so did I.

757
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:39,223
Because he's not dead.

758
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:42,426
Because he's you, Omar.

759
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:46,196
He always was.

760
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:49,466
There was never a Dr. Jekyll.

761
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:51,769
Just Mr. Hyde.

762
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:57,708
Have you thought about my offer?

763
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:01,879
You and TKG
protected a known terrorist.

764
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:04,114
And the blood of every man, woman, and child

765
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,084
who died in Minneapolis is on your hands.

766
00:37:10,756 --> 00:37:13,657
You stood in front of the American people

767
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,493
and lied about Sheikh Hakam,

768
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:20,964
so our hands, Madam, are equally unclean.

769
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,101
I am offering you free, unfettered reign

770
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:27,438
to hunt and kill terrorists abroad

771
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,440
so that what happened in Minneapolis

772
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:32,309
never happens again.

773
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:35,646
My shadowing of Omar
Fatah built that ability.

774
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,514
And fueled Ar Rissalah...

775
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,116
Unintentionally or otherwise.

776
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:43,187
So we both share the stalemate
of mutually assured destruction

777
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,657
while our enemy, Omar Fatah,

778
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:48,659
still roams free.

779
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:51,562
I have options there.

780
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,163
Very limited options,

781
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,432
if you're referring to Charleston Tucker.

782
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,869
What are you getting at, Gantry?

783
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,475
An end game, Madam.

784
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,310
For you, for me,

785
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:09,113
for this entire country.

786
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:12,516
What if I could provide
Fatah's exact location

787
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,652
this very second.

788
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:17,921
The air force has two F-22 Raptors

789
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:20,424
on the ground in Nangarhar.

790
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,959
Do they not?

791
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,733
You hit our convoy in Kabul.

792
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,635
I killed my own men to save your life.

793
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,405
Because I was your link to CIA.

794
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,540
If you were killed,

795
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,708
I'd be cut off.

796
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:38,909
Pegasus would be no more.

797
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,844
This would all crumble.

798
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,814
Which Pegasus?

799
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:46,950
The op we were running?

800
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:50,854
Or the serial bombing of American cities?

801
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:57,461
America's never gonna allow for
moderation in the Muslim world.

802
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,863
It's never gonna open its mind to Islam.

803
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,865
You see only killers.

804
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,066
So killers we've become.

805
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:07,571
I saw the best part of you, Omar...

806
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,073
Not the Muslim...

807
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:11,975
The man.

808
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,912
I believed what you wanted
was good for Islam.

809
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:17,814
Enough with your lies.

810
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,816
You want to tear down Islam.

811
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:21,552
And not just the Jihadists, no.

812
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:22,619
All of us.

813
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:23,887
All of them!

814
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:25,422
Look at them.

815
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:27,658
Women and children running
because of your gun.

816
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,326
For how many years?

817
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:30,861
In Iraq, in Afghanistan,

818
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,829
all over our countries.

819
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:35,799
You're here to liberate us?

820
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,235
We don't need you.

821
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,536
We're done.

822
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:41,305
It's easier for you, isn't it?

823
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,307
If you believe that?

824
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,510
Then your betrayal becomes my problem.

825
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:47,844
Omar,

826
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,414
I trusted you.

827
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,716
I gave you all of my trust,

828
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:55,385
and you gave me nothing in return.

829
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:56,620
Nothing!

830
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,523
Now people I loved that trusted me

831
00:39:59,558 --> 00:40:00,624
are dead

832
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,326
because of you.

833
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,495
You have killed hundreds of innocents.

834
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:06,964
You will keep killing.

835
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:10,367
So now... so now...

836
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:11,868
when one can act...

837
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:13,637
Ahh!

838
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:14,738
Ah!

839
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,085
One should act as a liberator.
