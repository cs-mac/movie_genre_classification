I MOSTLY DO SKIN PEELS.

HIS CHEST
IS FILLING UP WITH AIR.

HE WILL GO INTO CARDIAC ARREST

69
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,429

70
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:23,869
- PATIENT HAD
A TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.

71
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,509
I DID A NEEDLE DECOMPRESSION
AT THE SCENE.

72
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:31,069
GET HIM UP TO TRAUMA BAY.
HE NEEDS AN X-RAY.

73
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,429
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

74
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,709
WHO ORDERED ALL THIS?

75

76
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,669

77
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,429
YOU'RE A NURSE, OKAY?

78
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:39,589
A NURSE?

79
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:41,149
I'LL HANDLE IT.

80
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,349
- YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR?

81
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:45,789
AFTER ALL THAT,
YOU'RE JUST SOME STUPID NURSE.

82
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,069
IF HE DIES, IF HE HAS
SO MUCH AS A SCAR,

83
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,669
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL SUE YOU,

I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
ON THE BROCHURES.

IMMEDIATELY TURNED OVER

PATIENT'S GOT A BENDY STRAW

THAT'S KEEPING HIM ALIVE,

96
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,699
AND ALL THAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT
IS HIS STUPID EGO.

97

- SCROTUM HEAD.

101
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,339
I CALLED HIM A SCROTUM HEAD.

102
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:44,019
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HE WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE.

- I WAS IN A WAR, TOO, YOU KNOW?

104

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
TALKING TO SOMEBODY ABOUT IT?

105
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,699
- I DON'T NEED TO TALK
TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT.

106
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,379
YOU KNOW WHY?

107
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,099
BECAUSE I'M ON DELICIOUS PAXIL.

00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,202
- COME ON, HAVE A GIN RICKEY.

479
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,802
- I DON'T WANT
A GIN RICKEY.

480
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,242
- WHEN DID YOU TURN
INTO SUCH A PILL?

481
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:33,962
- MOM!
- THAT IS SO WEIRD,

482
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,362
SAYING NO TO A GIN RICKEY.

483
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,402
- STOP SAYING GIN RICKEY.

484
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,602
- GIN RICKEY.
- GIN RICKEY.

485
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:39,642
both: GIN RICKEY.

486
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:42,802
- COME ON, RONNIE.

487
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,842
VERONICA.

488
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,442
YOU WANT TO TAKE A RIDE?

489
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:51,202
- NO.
- GIN RICKEY!

490
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:52,682
- COME ON, HURRY UP.

491
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,082
- MIKE, I CAN'T SEE.

492
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:56,002
- [laughs]
THAT'S THE POINT, BABE.

493
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,802
- I WANT TO TAKE
THIS THING OFF.

494
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,322
- WHY? I MADE
A NICE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

495
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:00,762
- BECAUSE IT'S STUPID,
THAT'S WHY.

496
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:02,962
- CAN YOU JUST PLAY ALONG?
- WHERE WE GOING, A STRIP CLUB?

497
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,922
DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH EVERYTHING?

498
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:06,682
- DO NOT MAKE IT LIKE I
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH EVERYTHING.

499
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:07,922
THE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS,

500
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:13,162
WE ENDED UP
WITH AN ABOVE-GROUND POOL.

501
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:17,322
- MIKE?

502
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:20,882
WHAT DID YOU DO?

503
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,402
OUR HOUSE.

504
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:24,882
- I BOUGHT THE LITTLE LOT
NEXT DOOR.

505
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:28,002
YOU REMEMBER
THAT NICE OLD LADY, MAE?

506
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,842
DEAD!

507
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,162
I WAS GONNA FIX IT UP
TO SELL IT,

508
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,442
BUT THEN I THOUGHT...

509
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,842
ADD A COUPLE MORE ROOMS,
MAYBE WE MIGHT NEED 'EM.

510
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,602
- ARE YOU DEAF?

511
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,762
THERE IS NO "US."

512
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:43,442
- OKAY, I GIVE UP!

513
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,242
FORGET IT.

514
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:48,602
- WHAT WAS THAT?

515
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,042
- YOUR ENGAGEMENT RING.
NICE REFLEXES.

516
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,722
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

517
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:53,922
WE'RE STILL PAYING
THAT THING OFF.

518
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:58,882
MIKE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT TOUCHED.

519
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,362
- I KNOW THE ARMY PAID
FOR YOUR EDUCATION,

520
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:02,922
AND YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANY CHOICE,

521
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:04,682
BUT I TOOK IT PERSONALLY
WHEN YOU LEFT,

522
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,442
LIKE YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

523
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,722
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

524
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:12,082
- I WAS STUPID AND INSECURE,
BUT I LOVE YOU.

525
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:14,842
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

526
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:17,202
-  LONG WAYS DOWN

527
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:18,482
- I THINK YOU LOVE ME.

528
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:20,762
NOBODY KNOWS YOU
LIKE I KNOW YOU.

529
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,042
I'M THE GUY, OKAY?

530
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,882
- MIKE, I AM ALL MESSED UP
RIGHT NOW.

531
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:31,322
- NO MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.

532
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:33,522
MAYBE THIS
IS WHAT MARRIAGE IS.

533
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,442
- TWO PEOPLE TORTURING
EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY DIE?

534
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,242
- YEAH, AND KIDS AND FRIENDS

535
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:40,922
AND GOING OUT TO DINNER
AND GREAT SEX.

536
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,402
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THIS?

537
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:49,042
-  OH, THAT'S HOW IT FEELS

538
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:53,962
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
YOUR HEART

539
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,842
IF I COULD FEEL IT

540
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:59,962
- LET ME ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

541
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:05,002
-  I WOULD UNDERSTAND
YOUR HEART

542
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:06,882
IF I COULD FEEL IT

543
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:10,602
- WILL YOU COME
BACK TO ME, RONNIE?

544
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:13,842
-  I WOULD UNDERSTAND
YOUR HEART

545
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:15,642
- YEAH.

546
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:18,513
YES, OKAY.

547
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,203
- THIS ONE.
- NO, THE BLUE ONE FOR SURE.

548
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,443
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

549
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:31,523
- OH, I LIKE THE RED ONE.

550
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:33,003
- IS THAT HELLO KITTY
ON YOUR SMOCK?

551
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,163
- YEAH. WHAT?

552
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:38,043
- I THINK THE BLUE.
- MM-HMM.

553
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:42,763
- WHAT IS THAT?

554
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,763
- MIKE AND I HAVE DECIDED
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

555
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,123
IT'S GOOD.

556
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,923
IT'S GOOD.

557
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:53,283
MY PARENTS ARE THROWING US
A PARTY AT DELANEY'S.

558
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:59,323
YOU SHOULD ALL COME.

559
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,643
- OH, VERONICA. GOOD.
THIS IS DR. SANDS.

560
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:02,643
- HELLO.

561
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:03,923
- HE'S JUST JOINED OUR STAFF.

562
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,203
WE'RE VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

563
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,203
HE WAS ON HIS WAY
TO SEE MS. BORGHOUSE.

564
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:10,323
MAYBE YOU COULD TAG ALONG?

565
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,523
- SURE.

566
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,043
- OKAY.

567
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,563
- HELLO. DR. SANDS.

568
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,763
I HEAR WE'RE PERFORMING
SOME SURGERY.

569
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:23,003
- MOM, DON'T YOU WANT
TO MEET THE DOCTOR?

570
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:24,243
- HAVEN'T I MET THEM ALL?

571
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:26,123
- WELL, NOW IS
THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS,

572
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:30,283
IF YOU HAVE ANY.

573
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,523
NO? OKAY, WELL...

574
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,283
- SOMETIMES PATIENTS
FIND IT HELPFUL

575
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:35,963
TO KNOW THE GOAL
OF A SURGERY LIKE THIS.

576
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:38,243
SINCE THE CANCER HAS SPREAD
TO HER OTHER ORGANS,

577
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:40,483
WHAT ARE WE HOPING
TO GAIN?

578
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,483
- HOPE.
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF HOPE?

579
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:46,363
- OH, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
UH...

580
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,243
WE ARE TRYING
TO BUY HER SOME MORE TIME.

581
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,563
- HOW MUCH TIME?

582
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:51,243
AND WHAT ABOUT RECOVERY?

583
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:55,043
AND WILL THERE BE
MORE CHEMO?

584
00:23:55,043 --> 00:24:05,483
- YES. YOU MAY BE LOOKING
AT MORE CHEMO.

585
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:08,403
- FINE.

586
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,683
WE'LL TRY EVERYTHING.

587
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,763
- OKAY.

588
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:17,643
WE'LL SCHEDULE THE SURGERY
FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

589
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,723
YOU DON'T THINK THAT
SHE SHOULD HAVE THE SURGERY?

590
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:21,163
- HEY, I'M JUST THE NURSE.

591
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,323
- SHE WANTS TO TRY
ALL AVAILABLE TREATMENT.

592
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,803
- THAT'S HER KIDS TALKING.

593
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,443
- WELL, I HAVE TO TAKE HER
AT FACE VALUE.

594
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:27,803
SHE WANTS TO FIGHT,
I FIGHT.

595
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:29,123
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I TREAT THE DISEASE.

596
00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:30,803
- YEAH?
WELL, I TREAT THE PATIENT.

597
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,243
MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDS
PERMISSION TO GIVE UP.

598
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:34,403
- HEY.

599
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:37,363
[rock music]

600
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:43,483
I'M ON A MISSION,
A FOOLISH KIND

601
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,323
IT TOOK ME OVER

602
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:48,363
AND HAS NOT LET UP

603
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,363
I TRIED TO TELL YOU

604
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,323
I LIKE YOUR STYLE

605
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:53,523
- HI.

606
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,323
-  BUT I GOT NERVOUS 
- HI.

607
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:57,043
-  AND COULD NOT SPEAK

608
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:59,043
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- [laughs]

609
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,803
- IT'S GOING REALLY GOOD,
I THINK.

610
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:04,323
- WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

611
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:06,683
- LOOKING FOR YOU.

612
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:08,683
I JUST GOT OUT.

613
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:10,883
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED FIRST, BUT I THOUGHT

614
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:12,483
IT WOULD BE MORE ROMANTIC
IF I JUST SWOOPED IN,

615
00:25:12,483 --> 00:25:14,283
TOLD YOU I LOVED YOU,
WE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

616
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:16,883
- IF YOU HAD CALLED, I WOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY.

617
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,483
- BESIDES, I WAS WORRIED
IF I CALLED,

618
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,763
YOU'D TELL ME TO STAY AWAY.

619
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:20,803
WHY?

620
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:23,323
- IT'S JUST, I'M...MARRIED.

621
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,483
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.

622
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,083
- WE WERE, BUT THEN I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE SHOULD...

623
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,123
TRY AGAIN.

624
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:33,123
ARE YOU CRAZY?

625
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:35,123
WE BARELY
EVEN KNEW EACH OTHER.

626
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,963
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

627
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:39,523
- IT IS TRUE,
AND THIS--THIS IS RUDE,

628
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,003
YOU JUST BARGING IN HERE
LIKE THIS,

629
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,483
TELLING A PERSON
THAT YOU LOVE THEM...

630
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:43,643
ON A TUESDAY,

631
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,163
WHEN THAT PERSON HAS
JUST RECOMMITTED

632
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,403
TO THEIR HORRIBLE MARRIAGE.

633
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:48,203
- YOUR HORRIBLE MARRIAGE?
WHOA, SOUNDS GOOD.

634
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:49,963
- IT IS. IT'S GREAT.
IT'S AMAZING.

635
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:51,163
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

636
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,843
- UH-HUH.
- WHAT?

637
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,363

HOW MUCH YOU RELY ON SARCASM.

638
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:57,163
- OOH, THAT HURTS.

00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:03,883
- WAIT, WAIT. WHOA.
HEY, WAIT.

643
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,043
- SO YOU SLEPT WITH THIS GUY

644
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:11,883
WHILE YOU WERE IN IRAQ?

645
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,803
BUT I MEAN, LIKE, WHERE?

646
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:15,203

648
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:20,283
SO DID YOU JUST DO IT
OUTSIDE IN THE SAND?

649
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:23,203
- OKAY, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
FOCUSING ON THE WRONG THING.

650
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:25,363
- WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO VISUALIZE.

651
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:27,843
- WHY DO YOU NEED TO VISUALIZE?

652
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:30,363
IT WAS A HOSPITAL, OKAY?

653
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:33,083
WE STAYED IN A HOSPITAL.

654

- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

I MEAN, WE HAD
THIS REALLY INTENSE CONNECTION,

662
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:53,843
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM.

HE'S A GOOD GUY, YOU KNOW?

796
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:56,309
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

797
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,389
- AND I REALLY THINK THIS IS
GONNA MAKE MY LIFE MORE STABLE.

798
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,629
- YEAH, UM, WELL,
ACTUALLY MIKE'S DOWN THERE

799
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:02,389
ABOUT TO GET HIS ASS KICKED.

800
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:03,429
- WHAT?

801
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:04,589
-  DO DO-DO-DO
DO-DO-DO

802
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:05,629
DO DO-DO DO-DO

803
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,989
DO DO-DO DO-DO DO 
- GET OFF!

804
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,029
GET OFF OF HIM!

805
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,309
-  DO DO-DO DO

806
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,829
DO-DO DO DO-DO DO-DO DO 
- COME ON!

807
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:14,229
DO DO-DO DO DO-DO DO

808
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:18,509
DO-DO

809
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:21,349
- YOU ARE TOO OLD TO BE
GETTING INTO FIGHTS, DUMMY.

810
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:24,229
- IT WAS HIS FAULT.

811
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,629
- DECIDED YOU DIDN'T NEED
A DOCTOR?

812
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,229
- WELL, I DIDN'T LIKE
ANYBODY ON DUTY.

813
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:29,709
MIKE, THIS IS DR. SANDS.

814
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:33,029
DR. SANDS,
THIS IS MY HUSBAND MIKE.

815
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:35,309
I WANT HIM
TO HAVE A CAT SCAN.

816
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:37,029
- BARELY EVEN HURTS.

817
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,349
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE DRUNK.

818
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,749
YOU HIT THE CEMENT
WITH YOUR HEAD.

819
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:40,669
YOU'RE GETTING A CAT SCAN.

820
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,429
- TELL HER
I DON'T NEED NO SCAN.

821
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,189
- WELL, LADY
SAYS YOU NEED A SCAN,

822
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,149
YOU NEED A SCAN.

823
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,829
COME ON,
WE'LL TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS.

824
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:51,229
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

825
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,709
- I KNOW.

826
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:55,309
I KNOW. [groans]

827
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,709
SHE'S A BALL-BUSTER,
BUT I LOVE HER.

828
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,429
HEY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HER IN HIGH SCHOOL

829
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,869
WHEN SHE WAS
IN HER GWEN STEFANI PHASE.

830
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:06,349
- YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

831
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,789
- OOH, OOH, OOH.
- WHAT?

832
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:09,669
NEXT WEEK.

833
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:15,389
RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.
BUDDY SYSTEM, BOYS.

834
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,429
[bell rings]

835
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,189
- LAST CALL!

836
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:24,469
- HEY, MAN,
GIVE ME A SECOND.

837
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:25,675
HEY, YOU.

838
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,755
MY BUDDY, RYAN, INVITED
ME TO THIS PARTY,

839
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:29,035
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
I MISSED THE WHOLE THING.

840
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:30,635
- YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE?
- YES.

841
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,715
-  UH-HUH, THERE'S NO PAPA
THAT CAN TREAT MY LIKE A LOVER

842
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:36,275
WHO MAKES ME FEEL
SO RIGHT

843
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,715
HIS LOVE IS SO TENDER,
IT MAKES ME SURRENDER

844
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:40,395
WHEN HE SQUEEZE
AND HOLD ME TIGHT

845
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,270
- YOU WANT A DRINK
OR SOMETHING?

846
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,390
- STOP TALKING.

847
00:34:43,390 --> 00:35:05,750
-  THE WAY HE LOOKS
IN MY EYES

848
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,790
- HEY.

849
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,030
- HI.

850
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,310
- I, UH,
GOT YOUR HUSBAND'S SCANS HERE.

851
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,390
WANT TO COME TAKE A LOOK?

852
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:21,390
- YEAH.

853
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,750
- WELL, IT'S FINE.
THERE'S NO SWELLING.

854
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,390
- YEAH, WELL,
HE'S GOT A HARD HEAD.

855
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,150
- [laughs]

856
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,670
HEY, HOW YOU SLEEPING?

857
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,830
- BAD.

858
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,550
- YEAH. ME, TOO.

859
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,270
SO WEIRD BEING BACK.

860
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,630
- YEAH.

861
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,350
YEAH.

862
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,990
IT'S LIKE THERE'S THIS WALL
BETWEEN ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE,

863
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,630
AND THERE'S...
THERE'S ALL OF THIS STUFF

864
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,830
THAT I CAN'T GET
OUT OF MY HEAD.

865
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,910
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'M A GOOD NURSE ANYMORE,

866
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:10,190
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
BLOW UP ALL THE TIME.

867
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,630
AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

868
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,150
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVE
GONE COMPLETELY CRAZY

869
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:24,350
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU.

870
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,670
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE...

871
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,390
SORT OF BEEN CARRYING YOU
AROUND WITH ME.

872
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,710
BUT I JUST--I...

873
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,430
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO
THE RESPONSIBLE THING.

874
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,390
- YEAH.

875
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,670
I GUESS IT WAS,
UH, PRETTY STUPID OF ME

876
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,910
TO COME RUNNING OUT HERE
FOR YOU.

877
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,110
IT'S JUST THAT

878
00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:01,510
YOU WERE THE ONE THING
THAT MADE SENSE.

879
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,230
- WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

880
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,430
- THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.

881
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,790
I SIGNED
A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT.

882
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,630
I'M STAYING.

883
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,357
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HUSBAND HOME
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

884
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:29,796
- I GUESS
WE'RE NOT HAVING BREAKFAST.

885
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,316
- OH, UM...

886
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,796
GOTTA GO TO WORK.

887
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:43,316
BUT I'LL CALL YOU.

888
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:45,716
- [knocks]

889
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:47,476
TIME FOR YOUR MEDS.

890
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,836
WHY IS YOUR HAIR
ON THE GROUND?

891
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:54,236
- MY HEAD'S HOT. LEAVE IT.

892
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:56,636
WHAT'S WITH YOU
AND THE SEXY SURGEON,

893
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,516
THE ONE WHO SQUEEZED
YOUR ARM LAST NIGHT?

894
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:00,796
- YOU LOOKED
LIKE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

895
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:02,596
- UNBELIEVABLE.

896
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:04,156
MY DAUGHTER'S ONLINE DATING,

897
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,876
AND YOU WITH TWO MEN
AFTER YOU.

898
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:07,396
- YEAH, WE WERE
IN THE WAR TOGETHER.

899
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,236
TAKE YOUR PILLS.

900
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:12,396
- WAR? HOW SWEEPING
AND ROMANTIC.

901
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:13,836
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK

902
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,636
A MAN'S GONNA FIX
WHATEVER'S WRONG WITH YOU.

903
00:38:15,636 --> 00:38:20,916
- JUST SWALLOW THE DRUGS,
LADY.

904
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:32,156
- YOU THINK I SHOULD
HAVE THIS SURGERY?

905
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:38,156
- YOU KNOW...

906
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:39,516
IF YOU WERE MY MOTHER...

907
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:43,236
- YOU'D HAVE A BETTER HAIRCUT.

908
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:47,596
- UM, IF YOU WERE MY MOTHER,

909
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:51,276
I WOULD SAY NO.

910
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:53,716
IT'S TOO RISKY,
AND IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK.

911
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:58,116
- I'M DYING.

912
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:01,476
- YEAH.

913
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:06,676
YEAH, YOU ARE.

914
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:08,436
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT SCARE ME

915
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:11,196
ABOUT THIS SURGERY.

916
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:13,476
YOU COULD DIE
ON THE OPERATING TABLE.

917
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,996
AT LEAST
THAT WOULD BE PAINLESS.

918
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:19,836
OR YOU COULD DIE
IN RECOVERY,

919
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:25,996
IN PAIN AND ON A VENTILATOR,
AND THAT SCARES ME.

920
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,436
I THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO DECIDE

921
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:34,236
ON THE QUALITY OF TIME
YOU HAVE LEFT.

922
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:37,396
AND I'M--I'M SCARING
THE HELL OUT OF YOU RIGHT NOW,

923
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:39,796
WHICH IS WHY IT'S BECOMING
VERY CLEAR TO ME

924
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,796
I AM IN THE WRONG LINE
OF WORK.

925
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,316
- NO.

926
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,756
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S BEEN HONEST WITH ME.

927
00:39:47,756 --> 00:39:54,116
PEOPLE TREAT YOU LIKE
AN IMBECILE WHEN YOU'RE SICK.

928
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:59,116
- IF YOU WANT
TO STOP TREATMENT...

929
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:02,236
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SAY SO.

930
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:06,196
YOUR KIDS WILL UNDERSTAND.

931
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:20,316
- I THINK I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

932
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:23,396
VERONICA,
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL NURSE.

933
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:37,956
DON'T DOUBT IT
FOR A SECOND.

934
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:39,996
- SHE'S BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT.

935
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:43,036
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP
THE TRANSPLANT VULTURES AT BAY.

936
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,636
- DOES SHE HAVE ANY FAMILY
OR ANYTHING?

937
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,276
- I DON'T KNOW.

938
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,076
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE ELSE.

939
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:52,396
JUST HER.

940
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:55,396
<i>[The Kills'
Goodnight Bad Morning]</i>

941
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,156
-  SPEED'S WORKING,
I SEE IT

942
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:37,556
IN EVERYONE

943
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:47,636
LIKE A LOST IDEA
UNDER LIGHT BULB SUN

944
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:50,676
YOUR EYES,
READY FOR TAKEOFF

945
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:59,036
MELT IN YOUR HEAD

946
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:06,716
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STATE
WE'RE IN

947
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:10,116
- SHE, UH, CANCELLED
HER SURGERY.

948
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:16,996
I'M TAKING IT
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.

949
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:19,516
ARE WE GONNA BE OKAY?

950
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:21,116
- WELL, I WAS THINKING,

951
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:26,196
MAYBE YOU COULD
BE MY FRIEND.

952
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,516
OKAY, YEAH.

953
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:29,236
I'M LEAVING NOW.

954
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:30,836
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
- YEAH.

955
00:42:30,836 --> 00:42:33,156
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

956
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:34,156
I KNOW.

957
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:37,516
I KNOW.

958
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:41,156
I KNOW.

959
00:42:41,156 --> 00:42:42,716
- TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY

960
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,316
THAT I DIDN'T
WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

961
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:45,916
- THAT IS SO WEIRD,

962
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,236
BECAUSE TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL YOU.

963
00:42:48,236 --> 00:42:50,116
- TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
I WALK THROUGH NEWARK

964
00:42:50,116 --> 00:42:51,436
WITH MY PANTIES IN MY PURSE.

965
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,356
- BOY, IF I HAD A NICKEL...

966
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,236
[thud]
- WHAT? HEY!

967
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:59,436
[bottle shatters, shouting]

968
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,636
- GET HIM OUT!

969
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:03,156
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE?

970
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:05,236
- NO, WE'RE A HALF A BLOCK AWAY
FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

971
00:43:05,236 --> 00:43:06,836
- I'M NOT LEAVING THIS SEAT.

972
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:09,396
- OH, IT'S THE BARTENDER.
HIS ARM IS BLEEDING.

973
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:10,876
I'M GONNA GO SEE.
- THE UNICORN?

974
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,956
- HELL, NO,
SHE DOESN'T GET TO GO.

975
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,436
- HI.

976
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:17,396
- OH, YOU POOR THING.

977
00:43:17,396 --> 00:43:19,076
- OH, I DON'T REALLY THINK
IT'S THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

978
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:20,636
- YOUR ARM.

979
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:22,796
- CHLOE, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND HIM A CLEAN BAR RAG?

980
00:43:22,796 --> 00:43:24,116
- WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND HIM
A CLEAN BAR RAG?

981
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:26,076
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF,

982
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:27,076
JUST TO BE SAFE

983
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:29,316
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NURSES.

984
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:30,836
-  YOU ARE THE GIRL

985
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,796
THAT I'VE BEEN DREAMIN' OF
EVER SINCE

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
