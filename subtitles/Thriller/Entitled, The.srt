1
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,501
Why did I do it?

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,501
I didn't do it
out of greed or envy.

3
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:05,636
I did it because there was
nowhere left to go.

4
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:34,773
See, I'm nothing special.

5
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,742
I'm like everybody else..

6
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,506
getting by

7
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,274
day by day,

8
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:42,611
week by week,

9
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,982
dreaming about that one thing
that'll make everything all right.

10
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,047
That one thing.

11
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,991
JD Couriers. May I have
your account number, please?

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,401
- Another one?
- Yep.

13
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,962
Why are you bothering, kid?

14
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,566
You got a job for life here.

15
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,543
Yeah.

16
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,659
Well, it's all here. You've got
everything we're looking for.

17
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,220
Great. Thank you.

18
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:33,323
We should be able to let you know

19
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,231
sometime next week, so..

20
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,105
Can I ask you a question, sir?

21
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,078
I'm not gonna get this job, am I?

22
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,312
- I really need this job.
- I'm sorry.

23
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:57,915
A couple of years ago, you would
have walked straight in, but now..

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,654
I could start right away. I'd work for
free for a month if you needed me to.

25
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,093
I'm sorry, son.

26
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,463
Sorry?

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,400
Yeah, me too.

28
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,190
Are you done?

29
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,695
Yeah.

30
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,998
I'm done.

31
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:54,404
Yeah, I had dreams, but they're over..

32
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,317
because one day
you just gotta wake up.

33
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:05,389
- You just gotta wake up.

34
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,986
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi, Mom.

35
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,883
- How are ya?
- Pretty good.

36
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,286
How was your day?

37
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,265
Oh, you know..
same old, same old.

38
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,531
It'll come good.

39
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,233
I graduated two years ago.
I'm still living with my parents.

40
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,902
Well, do you hear us complaining?

41
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,638
Oh, I made you
some sandwiches.

42
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,149
You know, just to keep
that guilt thing going.

43
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,518
- Where's Dad?
- Working late.

44
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:12,457
You know,
you're pretty late yourself.

45
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,289
I guess if I keep on studying,

46
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,160
I can trick myself into believing
I'm getting somewhere.

47
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,748
- Why haven't you filled these?
- I'll get around to it.

48
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,773
Ma, you need to take
your medication.

49
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,717
They don't come free, Paul.

50
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,244
It's already wiped us out.

51
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:45,519
Don't worry.
I'll get better.

52
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,261
But in the end it wasn't about me.

53
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,733
It wasn't about me at all.

54
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,969
I'll get by.

55
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,184
It was about seeing pain and struggle

56
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:25,095
and knowing there was not one thing
you could do about it.

57
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:42,706
But not anymore.

58
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:48,221
Not anymore.

59
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,379
Hey, bro.

60
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:26,724
- Hey, how are you doing, man?

61
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,828
Have you ever done it
in a canoe before?

62
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,865
I thought a civilian snuck in.

63
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,943
You got a paddle?

64
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:57,248
Come on, take a risk for once.
Be more like your dad.

65
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,884
I'm good.

66
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,451
At least pretend you're cool.

67
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:13,404
What?
You didn't want it anyway.

68
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,146
- Fucking bitch.
- Aw, come on.

69
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,014
If you want a nice girl, there's plenty
to choose from out there.

70
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,794
I love this song.

71
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,649
What are you thinking about?

72
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,853
Paul: You.

73
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,018
I'm thinking about
how smart you are.

74
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,695
You get me.

75
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,725
Yeah.

76
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,260
I knew from the second
I saw you.

77
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,647
We're the same, aren't we?

78
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,741
Yeah.

79
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:33,376
We're the same.

80
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:38,615
It's so good to be with someone
who sees through all the bullshit,

81
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,491
- somebody with a vision.

82
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,193
I'm going to see
Dean again tomorrow.

83
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,327
Are you sure he can handle it?

84
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,895
- I mean, he can lose it big time.
- Yeah well,

85
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,806
we need him if we're gonna
go through with this.

86
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,833
When's that gonna be?

87
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,080
When I'm sure.

88
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,049
You wanna go out tonight?

89
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,214
No, tonight's not good.

90
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,156
Why don't we..
we'll do it some other time.

91
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,354
It's not good any night. You don't want
to be seen with me or something.

92
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:18,228
Is it so bad I want you all to myself?

93
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,528
No.

94
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,433
You know I love that.

95
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,801
I love you.

96
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,068
I gotta go.

97
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,909
And I love you too.

98
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,659
All right, on three.
One, two,

99
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,729
- three.
- Aw, fuck it.

100
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,309
Oh God, what is that,
like a double?

101
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,643
- Triple.
- Give me another.

102
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,046
No no no, finals week, remember?

103
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,517
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- Oh, who cares? Come on.

104
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,680
Oh yeah, screw that. Don't forget
we've got a boys' night on Friday.

105
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,713
A boys' night..
yeah, I can't wait for that.

106
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,884
Come on, buddy.
We gotta keep the old fellas happy.

107
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,518
No, enough enough.
We've gotta go.

108
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,426
Oh, what is this?
Middle-age practice?

109
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:25,454
You know, you two would have
made such a good couple.

110
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,466
- Really, it's just..
- You're right, actually.

111
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,730
- I've just got too much fucking to do.
- Okay.

112
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,760
Let's go.

113
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,704
Oh, my bag.. gimme.

114
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,436
Oh, Nick, don't forget..

115
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,706
everybody sucks but us.

116
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,056
- Hi, Ma.
- Hey.

117
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:36,934
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

118
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:40,166
I got you something.

119
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,506
Here.

120
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,842
Where did you get
the money for it? I mean..

121
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,247
- insurance won't pay for it.
- It obviously did.

122
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,115
I can't afford it.

123
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:56,053
The doctor said you gotta take
two of these pills a day.

124
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,557
Remember to do that, okay?

125
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,354
Ma?

126
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,062
No no, see, th-they can't.

127
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,936
They can't just do this.

128
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:14,963
Paul..

129
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,639
I'm so afraid.

130
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,806
Oh, Mom.

131
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,180
It's okay.

132
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,208
I'm so sorry.

133
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:34,115
I'll take care of this, okay?

134
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,545
A few days, the world's
gonna know who you are, Dean.

135
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,714
You ever think about that?

136
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,624
I have, yeah.

137
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,863
I can't do this on my own, Dean.

138
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:49,129
And we are all on our own.

139
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,072
Not anymore.

140
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:59,103
Tick-tock, tick-tock,

141
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,773
tick-tock, tick-tock,

142
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:03,679
tick..

143
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,488
Maybe she's right about you.

144
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:16,724
I thought she was just falling
for your blue eyes.

145
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,992
Listen, if you guys have
a thing going on,

146
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,829
- I don't want to get in the way.
- We're just friends. That's it.

147
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,562
You haven't called her
or anything, have you?

148
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,301
No, I haven't called her.

149
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,309
Why would I..

150
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,005
I lost my cell anyway.

151
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,808
Go figure.

152
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,145
Yeah.

153
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,651
Why don't you go
grab me a beer?

154
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,189
Yeah.

155
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,775
So tell me,

156
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,869
is that just a word?

157
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,662
I gotta do something
with my Friday nights, huh?

158
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,679
Okay, so that's
two tickets to Guadalajara

159
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,841
this Saturday the 27th.

160
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,147
That's it. You're all set.

161
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,743
Anything else
I can help you with, sir?

162
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,755
No, I've got everything I need.

163
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,087
Thank you.

164
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:13,111
Sorry.
I would have called, but..

165
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,876
No, I know..
no communication, no trace.

166
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,976
It's safer that way
until it goes down, right?

167
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,848
You mean..

168
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,449
Yeah.

169
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,119
When?

170
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,220
Tomorrow.

171
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,733
- I'll do anything you want.
- Yeah.

172
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,134
I know you will.

173
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,003
I know.

174
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,158
Now don't forget, Nick,
we're at Cliff's this year.

175
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:05,527
Dad, I won't forget, okay? Yeah,
I gotta go. See you tonight. Okay, bye.

176
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,303
What are you doing?

177
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,104
You won't be needing
those anymore.

178
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,304
I will if I don't pass.

179
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,745
Nick, we passed
the day we were born.

180
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,909
Accept it, man.
We don't live in the real world.

181
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,886
We don't have to.
It's for those dumbfucks over there.

182
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,014
You're such a people person,
you know that?

183
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,717
Hey, what's going on with Hailey?

184
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,886
This childhood sweethearts thing..
that's getting kinda old, man.

185
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,396
You're crazy about her, right?

186
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,626
God help me, yeah.
Yeah, I am.

187
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,032
Is she crazy about you?

188
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,468
Yeah. No.
Yeah yeah yeah, of course she is.

189
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,369
Then God help your AmEx.

190
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,931
You're actually gonna have to do
a day's work. That's funny.

191
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,306
That is really hilarious.

192
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,641
Well, when that happens,
I'll let you know what it feels like, pal.

193
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,647
Oh oh yeah!

194
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,013
Oh oh oh!

195
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,218
I hope you never get to hear this.

196
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,813
But if you do,
if this all goes wrong,

197
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,586
I want you to know that I did it
to make things right.

198
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,354
Just to make things right.

199
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,221
I love you.

200
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,613
Aren't we getting a little old
for these family vacations?

201
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,953
I mean, being out in the middle
of nowhere is fine when you're 12,

202
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,925
but the novelty's
kind of wearing off.

203
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,928
Well, you still have to have your little
poker night before the girls are even

204
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,430
- allowed in the door.
- Apart from our homecoming queen.

205
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,525
- Thank you.
- Hey, we're out of beer there, hotshot.

206
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,973
- This do instead?
- Yes.

207
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,272
- That does very well.
- Whoo-hoo!

208
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,437
Oh, there we go.

209
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:02,133
This is what you're gonna do.

210
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,970
This is what you're gonna do.

211
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,933
This is what you're gonna do.

212
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,878
This is what you're gonna do.

213
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,742
Man:
It's a shitty color.

214
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:56,118
- What?
- This brown is like dark blue

215
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,588
or gray.. it's ugly.

216
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,386
- It's charcoal.
- No no no, it's not.

217
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:00,949
- It's charcoal?
- It's charcoal.

218
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,018
- It's charcoal.
- Yeah.

219
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:07,396
But the best part is I can't see
your house from here.

220
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:12,734
- Well, Bob's late.
- He wouldn't be Bob if he was on time.

221
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,968
He's been that way since
fifth grade, you know that.

222
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:18,442
The kids are gonna get here
before him, you know?

223
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:22,042
At least we'll have
some time with them.

224
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,108
How's work going?

225
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:30,644
Safe, for now. You?

226
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,884
Well, you know.
It's work.

227
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,416
It's good.

228
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:38,487
Oooh, yikes. Look at that.

229
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,498
- What? It's a watch.
- Yeah.

230
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,765
Even in a shitstorm you come up
smelling like a rose.

231
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:47,635
What's your secret?

232
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,301
You bend the rules and I just
squeeze the shit out of them.

233
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,105
You win big, you lose big,

234
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,237
that's what I say.
What am I gonna tell you?

235
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,339
You know what? We're on vacation.
No more work talk.

236
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,850
- Good. Sure, don't bring it up again.
- All right.

237
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,353
I just heard a loon.

238
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:05,090
Bob's here?

239
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,540
What do you think you're doing?

240
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,508
Hey, are you deaf?

241
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,418
What are you doing?

242
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,756
I'm waiting for someone.

243
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,156
Waiting for somebody.
Okay, who are you waiting for?

244
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,559
You.

245
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,697
Where's your boat?
I didn't see the boat.

246
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,068
Hey, Avis, this is great.

247
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,630
I couldn't have done it
without Frank.

248
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,108
- Uh..
- Frank, look at you.

249
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,703
- You missed your calling.
- No, I'm very happy behind the wheel.

250
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:36,737
No, I can just see a nice floral apron.
It would suit you.

251
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:40,183
- Thanks.
- Avis, the kids are gonna love it.

252
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,187
Now get yourself home.

253
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:44,712
Oh, only if you're sure
that's all you need.

254
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm sure. Home.

255
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,293
Okay. Good night.

256
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,124
Frank, I'm gonna need you
to hang around.

257
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:54,599
Bob can put them away, so we might
need you to give him a ride home later.

258
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,328
- Yes sir. Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

259
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,165
Go relax in the den, okay?

260
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,171
Why won't you let..
why doesn't he just stay here?

261
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:03,174
- He could, but he's not gonna.
- Why?

262
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,972
- That new blonde?
- Oh oh oh!

263
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:09,174
She reminds me of my second wife,
except I didn't have to buy her tits.

264
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,409
Badum-bum!

265
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,918
- Party time, my friend.
- Party time.

266
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,883
Fuck.

267
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,757
All right, on three we try..
try to grab my hand.

268
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,818
No, this is.. pull pull!

269
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:26,422
- Hailey: I can't.
- Fuck! Aw, fuck.

270
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:27,796
Shhh.

271
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:42,535
Please.

272
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,378
Jeff:
What do you want?

273
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,475
- Oh God.
- Don't you touch her!

274
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,214
- Nick: Let us go.
- Hailey: Please!

275
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,745
Nick: Just let us go.
We can help you.

276
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,782
We can get you anything you want.
Just please don't.. don't hurt her.

277
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:56,293
Please don't hurt her.

278
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,798
Answer me!

279
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:04,332
Please just..

280
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,841
Where the hell is Bob?

281
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:19,646
He's probably checking the tax
on his grocery bill.

282
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:23,746
That's why he's worth 10 times
more than us put together, right?

283
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:25,654
Except when it comes to Jeff.

284
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,159
Oh, Jeff, yeah right.

285
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,728
Now what do you suppose
he got him for graduation?

286
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,755
Probably socks from Switzerland.

287
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,394
- And aftershave.
- From Paris!

288
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,001
That better not be him.

289
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:46,033
Hey, why don't you ditch the suit?
Freshen up.

290
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,171
Are you hitting on me?

291
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,306
Hello.

292
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,341
- Mr. Jones?
- Yes?

293
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,081
- Mr. Clifford Jones?
- Yeah.

294
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:59,113
- You have a daughter named Hailey?
- Yes.

295
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,853
- That's right.
- No, actually that's wrong.

296
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,554
I have her.

297
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:06,462
I've also got Bob and Slick's boys.

298
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:09,194
- You want to talk to them?
- What is it?

299
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,262
Fuck.

300
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,932
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Tell us what you fucking want!

301
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:17,032
Don't fucking touch her.
Don't touch her.

302
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,669
- Just talk to us. Leave her alone.
- Fuck. Tell us!

303
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,980
All right.

304
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,452
So this is what's gonna happen..

305
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,718
What the hell's going on? If you so much
as touch a hair on my daughter's..

306
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,157
Why don't you cut the "if you touch her,
I'm gonna kill you"

307
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:35,955
fucking shtick,
you jackass, okay?

308
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,622
I'm gonna tell you what to do, you're
gonna do it and that's gonna be it.

309
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:40,824
It's as simple as that, okay?

310
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,595
Do you understand?

311
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,933
Okay.

312
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,633
Great.

313
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:51,335
I want a million dollars
from each and every one of you.

314
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,606
That's $3 million.
I want you to call your lawyers

315
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:56,478
and begin the bank arrangements.
There's gonna be no drop offs,

316
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,415
no suitcases full of money,
this is it.

317
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,941
I will call you in half an hour
with the bank accounts.

318
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,784
Do you have any questions?

319
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:06,814
I said any questions?

320
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,329
- No.
- And if you decide

321
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,955
to call the police, go right ahead.

322
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:16,559
All they're gonna do is clutter up
your house and delay our business.

323
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,967
And in that case..

324
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:22,599
save your money.
I'll say goodbye to your kids for you.

325
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:41,516
Were they scared?

326
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,586
- Yeah.
- Fucking pussies.

327
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:47,962
I love it. The one who was driving
makes me want to puke.

328
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:50,695
It'll all be over
in a couple of hours.

329
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,761
Well, I mean, it won't all be over.

330
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,002
Will it?

331
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:01,672
No, it won't.

332
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,647
Fuck! Voicemail again.

333
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:06,173
The one time we need him.

334
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,278
- Let's call the police.
- Okay, we call the police,

335
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,256
does that increase the chance of
catching this psycho? Yeah, it does.

336
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,384
Does it also increase the chance
of something happening to our kids?

337
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,622
Yeah, it does
and I don't like those odds.

338
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,062
- This is not a business deal.
- That's exactly what this is!

339
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:23,067
This is a business deal
and I'm doing risk assessment.

340
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,366
I'm not risking Nick's life because you
want to do what you think is the right..

341
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:29,237
Okay, then let's get out there and do
something to try and find them.

342
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:32,266
Well, Cliff, where do we start?

343
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,746
We're gone
and the guy calls, then what?

344
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,109
All right.

345
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:43,883
- We've gotta wait for Bob.
- Bob's not here.

346
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:48,291
Look, we don't have time
to make a debate about this.

347
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:52,763
All right, we need to stick together.
We can't afford to antagonize this guy.

348
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:54,958
All right, let's just do what he says.

349
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:58,663
Here.

350
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:02,971
Call your guy.

351
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,813
I'm going back downstairs.

352
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,849
Dean, you've got to stay up here.

353
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:24,259
No more than two people down there.
You know the rules.

354
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,093
Somebody has to be up here
to keep watch.

355
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:28,292
Yeah, so she can do it.
She can stay then.

356
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,893
No, Dean,

357
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:34,167
I need you for the big stuff.

358
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,436
Okay?

359
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,069
- Got it?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:55,215
- Everybody happy?
- Fuck you!

361
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:02,690
Oh yeah?

362
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,929
Why don't I just fuck you?

363
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,673
- What the fuck?
- Hmm?

364
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,231
Transfer arrangements
have been made?

365
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:47,109
- Yes.
- Good.

366
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,511
It should take a couple of hours
to work its way through the system

367
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,981
and then they'll be freed.
I want you to take this number down.

368
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:56,852
There's something you should know.
Bob Vincent hasn't arrived yet.

369
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,191
- Where is he?
- He's late.

370
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:02,818
- He's late?!
- What's going on?

371
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,091
It doesn't mean anything.
He'll be here any minute.

372
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,826
No, that's bullshit.
They're not gonna fucking pay us!

373
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,697
- They will!
- They'll pay whatever you want.

374
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,362
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Just give me a second, all right?

375
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,668
- Which one's missing?
- Hey, you fucking cool it.

376
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:17,038
- Look at..
- Which.. which one is fucking missing?

377
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:19,635
The guy in the middle.
Hey, all right,

378
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:22,203
I'll give Mr. Vincent another
half an hour and that's it.

379
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,579
That's bullshit! Can't you see
they're fucking playing us?

380
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:27,176
Hey, just fucking cool it, okay?
Look at me. Cool it.

381
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:29,584
Okay?

382
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,613
All right? We're gonna
take what we can get.

383
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,488
Okay.

384
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,619
We'll take what we can get.

385
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:43,258
Okay, so I want you
to take this number down.

386
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,968
Fucking bitch.

387
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:52,404
If we're not gonna wait, we don't
really need this asshole, do we?

388
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:54,844
Jeff! Jeff!

389
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,870
- No!
- God.

390
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:03,353
What the fuck?

391
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:05,822
What is wrong with you?
We were gonna do it anyway.

392
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,848
Give me that.
Get the fuck out of here.

393
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:12,320
- No!
- Jeff!

394
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:15,333
You fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch!

395
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,164
You fucking bitch!

396
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,032
- Listen to me..
- Dad!

397
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,903
That shouldn't
have happened, okay?

398
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,068
But if you don't want anything
like that to happen again,

399
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,011
- you'd better fucking listen to me.
- What the hell have you done?

400
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,913
- You killed an innocent boy?
- Just listen to me!

401
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,379
Bank of Lucerne,

402
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,153
- account number 0370995..
- You've got to say that again.

403
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,819
- Please, Dad!
- Account 0370-

404
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:46,297
- 995731.
- Dad!

405
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,595
- No! Fuck!
- Again.

406
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,362
5731.

407
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:54,338
You know the deal.. false names,
money there for five seconds and then out.

408
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:57,307
It'll take two months to track it down
and by then I'll be gone.

409
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:59,333
You've got till 3:00 a.m.

410
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:02,540
3:00 a.m.

411
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,777
Nick, what are they doing?

412
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,556
- Jeff.
- Fuck.

413
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:48,996

414
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,424
I know the banks are closed.
What do you think, I'm a fucking moron?

415
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,366
Just.. use one
of the foreign accounts, Chuck!

416
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,893
I'll explain it to you another time.

417
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:03,635
I gave you the details,
now just fucking do it!

418
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,166
Are they giving you trouble?

419
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,806
I guess it's not every day that they're
asked to transfer a million bucks.

420
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:15,278
He called you Slick.

421
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:20,350
- What?
- The first time he phoned

422
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,916
he called you Slick.

423
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,160
Are you sure?

424
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,428
I haven't called you that
since college.

425
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,214
You're the only one who ever did.

426
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,582
What's going on, Rick?

427
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,252
If there's
anything else you need, I can..

428
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,820
Is something wrong?

429
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,559
Are you gonna stick
to the goddamn plan from now on?

430
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,762
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal is

431
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,828
you just fucking killed somebody.

432
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,397
- Is that an everyday occurrence for you?
- He deserved it, didn't he?

433
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:13,171
Anyway you're the one
who's been telling me for months

434
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,338
how we're gonna fuck them over.
Right?

435
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,110
Stick it to them, destroy their
perfect fucking little lives.

436
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:21,812
I thought you'd be.. I thought
that's what you fucking wanted.

437
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,579
It's not.

438
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:28,615
I'm sorry, okay?

439
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:31,994
I just want to make you happy.

440
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,466
That's all. I.. I love you.
I would do anything for you.

441
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:42,165
Well, then stick to the fucking plan.

442
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,960
You know,
why did she get to do that?

443
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:06,964
- Don't worry, you'll get your turn.
- Yeah, I'd better.

444
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,024
I didn't come out here
to just channel surf.

445
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:13,936
- I know.
- Good.

446
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,532
This place is covered in our prints.

447
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,908
Fibers and all that shit..
you know that too?

448
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,214
That's why we're gonna
burn it down after we're done.

449
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,045
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

450
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:34,123
Dean..

451
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:37,319
what's your problem?

452
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:39,853
I'm looking at it.

453
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,565
How's that?

454
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:47,036
- You just don't add up.
- Meaning?

455
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:50,598
Well, you say
you want to fuck them,

456
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:53,509
but really you want to be them.

457
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

458
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:57,771
- Is that it?
- No.

459
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:00,409
No, this is just your little shortcut
into the club, isn't it?

460
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,011
- Isn't it?!
- Oh yeah.

461
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:07,855
You're right, Dean,
except for one little thing.

462
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:11,726
There isn't going to be
a club left,

463
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:14,027
is there?

464
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,551
Oh God, Nick!

465
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:45,755
Shh shh shh! It's okay.

466
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,425
- We're going to be okay. Okay?

467
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,971
Please don't touch her.

468
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:05,480
- Please don't touch her.
- Shut the fuck up.

469
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:09,452
She's gonna want to look her best,
like the little doll she is.

470
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,555
Please don't.

471
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,060
We'll get you the money.
I promise we will.

472
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,962
- This isn't about money.
- Why are you doing this?

473
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:22,431
- What the fuck is this about?
- This is about you.

474
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,458
You think you rule
the fucking world, huh?

475
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:27,096
Well, not tonight you don't.

476
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:28,571
Sit still.

477
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,871
There's a new show
in town tonight,

478
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,139
one night only.

479
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:36,703
What are you talking about?

480
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:41,082
My boyfriend's
a really clever guy.

481
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,586
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,714
He planned the whole thing.
But he's a bit predictable.

483
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:49,488
So we thought: what's the best way
to end any show?

484
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,160
Hmm?

485
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:57,494
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

486
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,629
With a bang.

487
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,400
- What what?
- But don't worry,

488
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,032
it's not for you.

489
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,305
It's for the folks back at home.

490
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,942
See, 3:00 a.m.
they'll be sitting there,

491
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,677
thinking they've done their duty,
and I guess you can say

492
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,480
we'll blow the fucking roof off.

493
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:22,749
Hey, have you ever
opened up a modem before?

494
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,058
- What?
- There's nothing there.

495
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:28,190
Just a circuit board
and a lot of empty space.

496
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:31,201
You really can
put anything in there.

497
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,601
Anything.

498
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,129
And if it's attached to a laptop

499
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:38,734
and it's programmed to detonate
like your daddy's is,

500
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:42,007
well, 3:00 a.m.

501
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,173
No.

502
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:05,959
Oh Jesus.

503
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:08,631
Oh man.

504
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,231
How long is this gonna take?

505
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:14,301
- Cliff, just take it easy, okay?
- How the hell do you remain so calm?

506
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:17,314
Because us panicking
isn't going to help our kids.

507
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,248
All right?

508
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:21,444
We'll get them home.

509
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:22,975
We have to.

510
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:29,286
- That's Bob.
- Okay.

511
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,228
So what are we gonna tell him?

512
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:36,495
Anything but the truth.
He'll go to the cops.

513
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:38,968
Anything but the fucking truth.

514
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:43,264
Cheers.

515
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,172
Coming!

516
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:52,245
Okay.

517
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:56,151
- Oh, Bob.
- Howdy, campers!

518
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:57,518
- You're late.
- Hey.

519
00:42:57,555 --> 00:42:59,580
Guys, I don't blame you
for being pissed off.

520
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,320
Same old story, right?

521
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,954
Am I talking to myself here?

522
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:07,692
- No no.
- So I'm a couple of hours late.

523
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:10,360
What's the big fucking deal?
There's no harm done, is there?

524
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,301
Good seeing you.

525
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,328
I can guess who that is. Looks like
I'm not the only one who's late.

526
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,310
- Just get the phone.
- Yeah? You talk to him.

527
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,904
Yeah. Just get the phone.

528
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:31,577
Yeah?

529
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,422
Oh hi, sweetheart.

530
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,724
Hey yeah, no.
Everything's great.

531
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:42,255
Bob just got here.

532
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,033
No, she hasn't arrived yet either,
but you know how it is.

533
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,507
No, not tonight.
No, you'll see her tomorrow.

534
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,906
Yeah. Yeah yeah.

535
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:54,070
Yeah, good night, honey.

536
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:56,875
Jesus, you'd think they'd leave us alone
on our one night of freedom!

537
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:58,848
Hey, guys, listen,

538
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:01,545
I brought a great surprise for Jeff.

539
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,919
In fact I drove it here.
He's gonna love it!

540
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:09,154
- What?
- If I roll this, I think it..

541
00:44:09,193 --> 00:44:12,026
I think it's loose.

542
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,332
Nick, Nick, hurry.

543
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,695
Oh God.

544
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:27,099
Fuck.

545
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,637
Okay okay.

546
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:33,877
Okay, all right, okay.

547
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,923
Okay okay.

548
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:42,949
Wait a second, Hailey,
wait a second. Shh shh shh.

549
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:44,086
Shh-hhh.

550
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,153
It's okay. Be quiet.

551
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,789
Okay? Okay?

552
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,595
All right?

553
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,963
Hurry.

554
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,171
All right, all right.

555
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,074
Okay okay, you're okay.

556
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:10,210
Okay okay okay.

557
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:12,552
I don't believe this.

558
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,353
What?

559
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:18,418
We're at my dad's house.

560
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:38,507
Okay.

561
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:53,546
Well, you really did
think of everything.

562
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:56,389
Yeah, it's even better
than you promised.

563
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,369
To chaos.

564
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,803
To the American dream.

565
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:34,257
Something's wrong.

566
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:36,528
- Yeah, they should be here any minute.
- No, come on.

567
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,296
How long does it take to fix a flat?

568
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,304
You're not gonna get a signal
on that up here, Bob.

569
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:49,540
- Top you up?
- Yeah, thanks.

570
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,210
- Dick?
- Yeah.

571
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:57,220
It went right to voice-mail.

572
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:58,778
Hey, is Frank here?

573
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:01,086
- Yeah.
- So what are you waiting for?

574
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,355
Send him out to find them.

575
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:04,725
Th-there's no point.

576
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,656
- What's he gonna do?
- There's, um,

577
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,725
there's something
that we haven't told you.

578
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:14,905
- What is it?
- Dick.

579
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:17,430
No, it's all right, Cliff.

580
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,445
Jeff got pulled over for a DUl.

581
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,004
Oh, God damn it!

582
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:28,780
And made us promise
not to tell you, but I.. I'm sorry.

583
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:31,151
I knew there was something
going on between you two.

584
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,418
Shit!

585
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:35,425
I'd better get down there.
Where are they?

586
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,950
You'd just be wasting your time.
We called your lawyer.

587
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:39,792
He's gonna have them out
in a couple hours.

588
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,128
- I'm still going.
- No no, just..

589
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:45,158
you know what?
Let them sweat it out for once.

590
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:46,794
All right?
It'll teach them a lesson.

591
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,532
You know how they are.

592
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:53,033
Yeah.

593
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,637
You're right.

594
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:58,876
Champagne?
Cheers.

595
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,248
Jesus, I can't believe it.

596
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,586
Her father's place is
the only place within miles.

597
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,485
There's only two ways to get there..
they can take the road.

598
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:41,457
Nobody's gonna be around this time
of night so they're gonna take the forest.

599
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,518
Stay together, go due north. I've gotta
stay here and wait for the money.

600
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:46,529
They may just hole up
somewhere till daylight.

601
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,088
That's fine. As long as they're not there
to stop it, I don't give a fuck.

602
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,226
- They're not gonna wait till daylight.
- Why not?

603
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:54,032
- 'Cause I told them about our surprise.
- You what?!

604
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,200
- Why would you do that?
- You fucking dumb-ass!

605
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:00,176
- I don't know. Fuck.. fuck off.
- She fucked the whole thing up!

606
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,370
- Fuck you.
- Shut up, enough.

607
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:02,743
- I was afraid..
- I'm through taking orders.

608
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,543
You'll still find them.
Shut the fuck up.

609
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:06,014
I'm not going.
There's no point in going.

610
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,210
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

611
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,946
- What's the fucking point?!
- The point is

612
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:11,011
you have a chance
to change something, okay?

613
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:13,250
You have a chance to convince
the world you're not the same

614
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,657
fucking loser you've been every other
goddamn day of your fucked-up life.

615
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:18,685
Okay?
That's the point!

616
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:28,033
You know what?

617
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:31,269
I'm getting kinda tired
of this place anyway.

618
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:35,378
Dean, I want them back alive.

619
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:37,903
Hey.

620
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,911
Go.

621
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:51,221
Fuck.

622
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,109
Are you sure we're going
in the right direction?

623
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:13,480
Yeah, I'm sure.

624
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:21,046
Nick!

625
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,922
Nick!

626
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,365
Okay okay,
we'll stop just for a sec.

627
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:33,700
- We're never gonna make it.
- We still have three hours.

628
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:35,466
We'll make it.

629
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,305
I still can't believe we were
in your father's house.

630
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:48,613
- Yeah.
- I mean, this is seriously fucked up.

631
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:50,381
You know?

632
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:54,213
Yeah, I know.

633
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:56,123
All right, let's go.

634
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:03,898
- Hey, that's gotta be them now.
- I got it.

635
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:06,129
Hello?

636
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,865
Hey hi, Bill.

637
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:10,237
Oh really?

638
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:13,505
Hey, that's great news.

639
00:52:13,544 --> 00:52:17,105
Yeah. Good good.

640
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,240
Okay thanks, buddy.

641
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:21,251
- Bye.
- Who was that?

642
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:24,049
My broker.

643
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,250
You know..
some deal he was working out.

644
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,351
- At 1:00 in the morning?
- That's what I pay him for.

645
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,521
Eh, you gotta give me his number.

646
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,762
- Your money's gone through?
- Yeah.

647
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:42,704
Well, I haven't heard anything.
This is taking way too fucking long.

648
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,503
- Get on it.
- I.. I..

649
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:48,204
I gotta go make a call.

650
00:52:48,245 --> 00:52:50,941
- There's a phone right here.
- It's, uh, it's..

651
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,573
it's a personal call.

652
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:55,107
You mean a woman?
You got a little action going?

653
00:52:55,152 --> 00:52:57,620
- I'll be right back.
- Then you're gonna share, right?

654
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,019
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

655
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:24,170
Oh God.

656
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:40,096
I miss cassettes.
I could work cassettes.

657
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,792
- Oh yeah?
- Cliff?

658
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,393
- Come here for a minute?
- Yep.

659
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:47,426
I'm sorry, Bob.
This won't be long.

660
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:49,302
What the hell is up
with you two tonight?

661
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,433
- It's nothing. I'll explain it later.
- Okay.

662
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:57,277
- What's going on?
- I just talked to Chuck.

663
00:53:57,314 --> 00:54:00,010
- Yeah, what?
- I don't have enough to cover it.

664
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:03,917
- What?
- Everything's..

665
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,479
it's tied up.

666
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:08,582
You're kidding me.

667
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,616
What are you gonna do?

668
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:16,857
Fuck.

669
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,334
Fuck.

670
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:23,203
- How much?
- $750,000.

671
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,970
What?

672
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:28,307
Oh, come on.

673
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:40,185
- Don't hold out on me, Cliff.
- That's a hell of a lot of money.

674
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,919
- For Nick's life?
- No, of course not.

675
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,951
Not for Nick's life.
I haven't got it.

676
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:49,456
What?
You think I'm lying to you?

677
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,626
This is our kids' lives
we're talking about..

678
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,431
- Exactly.
- You think I'm lying to you?

679
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:58,839
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

680
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:03,035
Tell me.

681
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,224
The kids have been abducted.

682
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,488
Wh.. what are you talking about?

683
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,932
- They've been kidnapped.
- Kidnapped?

684
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,337
Is this for real?

685
00:55:29,773 --> 00:55:32,367
Yeah, it's for real.

686
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,207
Jesus Christ.

687
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:40,739
W-where are they?
Are they hurt?

688
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:46,218
- No.
- Is Jeff.. is Jeff okay?

689
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,082
Bob..

690
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,992
- I want you..
- Jeff's okay.

691
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:02,966
Fuck.

692
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:05,668
Are you okay?

693
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:09,008
- Are you okay?
- This is bullshit.

694
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:12,846
Why can't we just go to the road
and get some help?

695
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,976
There's no help, Hailey, okay?

696
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:17,316
It's the middle of the night
and we're in the middle of nowhere.

697
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:19,788
Now let's go.
Come on. Come on.

698
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:22,451
Stop!
Stop acting like you're in charge.

699
00:56:22,492 --> 00:56:25,893
- We're going to the road!
- Look, I'm telling you that..

700
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:30,398
Come on, come on, come on.

701
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,595
I can't believe you didn't tell me

702
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,866
the minute I walked
through the fucking door.

703
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:38,068
- That was my idea. I'm sorry.
- Always playing an angle, aren't you?

704
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:42,475
Gimme that account number.

705
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:55,085
What are we doing?
We gotta tell him.

706
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:57,423
Nothing's changed.
He'll call the cops.

707
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:00,328
His kid's dead and we're letting him throw
away a million bucks?

708
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,695
It's the only way I can save my kid.

709
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,792
You couldn't fucking
help me, could you?

710
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,462
- Christ.
- Christ what?

711
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:08,471
And you would do some..

712
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:10,370
Done.

713
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:30,156
Hey, Ma, um..

714
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:34,160
I know you're sleeping, but, um..

715
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,165
look, I..

716
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:49,440
um, I.. I was just calling you
'cause I'm gonna..

717
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:53,777
I'm gonna be home
a little late tomorrow.

718
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,355
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we got it.

719
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:38,793
- Oh man, that's so awesome.
- Give that to me.

720
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:40,319
Give it to me, come on!

721
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:42,888
- What's going on?
- Let them go.

722
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,730
We don't need them anymore.

723
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:49,228
Just sit back, enjoy the fireworks.
Meet me at the gas station.

724
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:51,263
I'll be right there.

725
00:58:53,376 --> 00:58:56,470
Wow. Well, if that's
what you really want.

726
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:58,276
You take the road.

727
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:00,579
- I'm going straight on.
- What'd he say?

728
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:03,211
Kill them.

729
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:26,468
It can't be much longer.
They can't be that far away.

730
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:30,070
How do we know?
They could be anywhere.

731
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:33,048
I don't know, I'm just assuming.
They were on their way here.

732
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:37,854
You know, I really admire
your confidence, Rick.

733
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:40,254
What do you mean?

734
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:45,024
Well, you seem to be
pretty sure that

735
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:46,756
this guy's gonna let them go.

736
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,095
Why is that?

737
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:43,414
Hailey, come on.

738
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:45,580
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

739
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,689
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
it hasn't crossed your mind, Nick.

740
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:53,355
That we just happened to be
in your father's place?

741
01:00:53,396 --> 01:00:56,559
- That they knew it would be open?
- No no, it hadn't crossed my mind.

742
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:59,659
I mean, do you think it's that obvious?
Do you think it's that simple?

743
01:00:59,703 --> 01:01:02,194
Yeah, maybe it is.

744
01:01:02,238 --> 01:01:04,229
I'm his son, Hailey.

745
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:06,367
He's not gonna hurt me.

746
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:10,978
Well, you're not hurt,
are you, Nick?

747
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:12,675
Jesus Christ.

748
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:15,344
What the fuck
am I doing with you?

749
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:18,115
And you're a real catch, huh?
A hero?

750
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:22,250
Jeff is dead!
You didn't stop them!

751
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:25,284
- You didn't do anything!
- What the fuck was I supposed

752
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:27,421
- to do, Hailey?

753
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:34,769
Look, you'll get your money.
You don't have to do this.

754
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:37,739
- But I want to.
- Please, no. No, please!

755
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,847
Nick: Go go go!

756
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:52,946
Go!

757
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:56,887
Go!

758
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:00,322
Fuck you!

759
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:09,700
- I've got my money.
- Okay, what about our kids?

760
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:12,799
- You got what you wanted.
- You'll get them back in an hour.

761
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:15,436
This is the last time you'll be
speaking to me. In the meantime,

762
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:18,242
I don't want you to make or take
any phone calls. Do you understand?

763
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:21,114
- Yes.
- Good. And by the way,

764
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:23,642
tell your kids the show
has been canceled.

765
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:26,154
- What?
- They'll know what I'm talking about.

766
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:28,817
Okay, I need to know
our kids are safe.

767
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:30,382
They're safe.

768
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,357
He got the money.

769
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:39,527
He says he'll have them
back in an hour.

770
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:55,584
Excuse me, Mr. Jones,
can I call my wife?

771
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:58,018
- She panics if I'm..
- I'm sorry, not tonight.

772
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:02,284
Of course. I'm sorry.

773
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:05,385
Don't you ever get tired
of knowing your place, Frank?

774
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:08,329
- No sir.
- Don't call me sir.

775
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:11,731
- I'm not paying your goddamn wages.
- All right, that's enough.

776
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:12,996
Is it?

777
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:16,403
I think I can say exactly
what I want right now.

778
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:19,840
Okay, say exactly what
you want right now, Bob.

779
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:26,414
Well, you know what they say about
these things, don't you, Richard?

780
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,679
No, go on, tell us, Bob.

781
01:03:28,718 --> 01:03:32,984
That they sometimes turn out
to be an inside job.

782
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,691
Am I right, Cliff?

783
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:53,036
- You're not serious?
- You're the one who needed the money.

784
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:55,909
Are you outta your fucking mind?

785
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:57,879
It's the truth, isn't it?

786
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:00,474
Well, how come you suddenly
have no money,

787
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:02,576
you come in here
like you're king of the hill?

788
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,143
You want the truth?
Here it is.

789
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:08,283
I got burned.. big time.
The party's over for me.

790
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:11,589
But who wants to hear that in
the land of milk and fucking honey?

791
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,619
I'm done!

792
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:17,023
Fucking happy?

793
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:21,895
Hey, Richard, just one question.

794
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:24,168
Is this one of your
pump-and-dump scams?

795
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:26,232
Bail out when the price
gets high enough?

796
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:28,710
- Wh.. where is this all coming from?
- I'm just asking.

797
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:31,373
What, are you two guys
the sons of the soil, huh?

798
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:34,781
I got news for you.. we all do
the same fucking thing.

799
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,682
We push numbers around

800
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,244
and we fuck everybody else
as long as we get ours.

801
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:40,654
End of story.

802
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,851
Only your numbers
don't always add up, do they?

803
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:44,723
And right now you decided
that that bothers you?

804
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:46,752
No, right now
you're the odd man out.

805
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:47,956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

806
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:50,056
Not tonight, Bob.
That's you.

807
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,590
Oh, and how's that?

808
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:58,940
Tell me!

809
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:08,507
All right, I'm sorry.
Let's just cool it.

810
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:11,213
All right, we're saying shit
that we don't mean.

811
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:14,712
Let's just keep it together.

812
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:21,123
They killed Jeff.

813
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:28,567
Come on, we've got to get them
out of the house.

814
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:37,236
Don't don't don't.

815
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,622
- What?
- Come on.

816
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:06,966
Come on, come on,
pick up the fucking phone.

817
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,035
- We're too late.
- No, we're not too late.

818
01:06:09,078 --> 01:06:11,638
Fuck 'em. Try the cops.

819
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:29,118
You killed my best friend, you bitch.
You fucking killed him!

820
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,886
No, fuck you!

821
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:37,094
Nick, stop!

822
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,226
Get..

823
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:48,109
Nick, stop!

824
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,653
Nick.

825
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:11,365
I recognize her. I've seen her
around campus and the other one.

826
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:13,266
All right?

827
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:16,100
Yeah.

828
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:18,039
I think you're right.

829
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,703
Come on.

830
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:23,541
Come on, let's go.

831
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:26,013
Come on.

832
01:09:07,056 --> 01:09:10,492
Here, Bob.
That could help.

833
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:20,334
Oh Christ.

834
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:25,567
It would have helped
if you'd saved my son.

835
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:29,434
Bob, there was nothing
that we could do.

836
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:31,447
We didn't have a chance
to save him, Bob.

837
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:33,244
I had to tell them
that you weren't here.

838
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,307
Why the hell did you
tell them I wasn't here?

839
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:38,286
- Why did they have to know that?
- Because I was stalling him.

840
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:40,755
I didn't know if we could get
the money together.

841
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:45,227
- Our kids' lives were at stake.
- No, my kid's life was at stake!

842
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:48,355
- My kid!
- Bob, you weren't here.

843
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,262
We couldn't have saved him.

844
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:53,959
Oh.

845
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,967
Well, you certainly
got your shit together

846
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:01,306
when it came to taking
my money, didn't you, Rich?

847
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:03,869
What else could I do?
Let them kill Nick too?

848
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:07,610
You'll get your money back, okay?
Every cent.

849
01:10:10,753 --> 01:10:12,414
Fuck you!

850
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:21,320
All right, let's just say that
I accept everything you've said.

851
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:24,333
You don't seriously think
I'm going to sit here all night

852
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,562
while the psycho
who's got my money..

853
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:31,005
killed my son..
just walks away?

854
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,373
- We don't have any choice.
- Well, you might not have a choice,

855
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,605
but I do and I choose to do
something about it.

856
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,410
No, Bob, Bob, I'm not going
to let you do that.

857
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,382
- Gimme the phone!
- No!

858
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:44,511
- You're not calling the police.
- Maybe if you had

859
01:10:44,554 --> 01:10:46,112
Jeff would still be alive.

860
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:48,555
No, if you were here,
he'd still be alive, Bob!

861
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:50,422
If you were fucking here!

862
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:58,259
- You fucker.
- No, God damn it.

863
01:10:58,301 --> 01:11:00,360
- Let go.
- Come on.

864
01:11:00,403 --> 01:11:01,927
Let go of me!

865
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:52,420
Fuck!

866
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:55,618
Where did they go?

867
01:11:57,627 --> 01:11:59,720
I don't know.

868
01:11:59,762 --> 01:12:02,230
Get up. Get up.

869
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:05,961
Get up! Which way?

870
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:08,698
Who cares?

871
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,369
Fucking asshole.

872
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:15,241
You're the fucking asshole!

873
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:21,248
You're the fucking asshole.

874
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,319
Get up!

875
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:51,405
Stupid motherfucker.

876
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,385
What's with this?
Where's mine, huh? That's not my car.

877
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:11,727
She was like that when I got here.
They must've..

878
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,327
Where did they go?

879
01:13:15,371 --> 01:13:18,636
I don't know.
They're alive.

880
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:21,905
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
Hmm? Blanks!

881
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:25,345
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't be able
to control yourself, Dean.

882
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:27,440
Fucking smartass.

883
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:32,381
Well?

884
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:33,888
What are we waiting for?

885
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:36,187
Let's get out of here.
It's gonna blow any second.

886
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:38,193
Dean?

887
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:40,252
You were right.

888
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:46,128
You're all on your own.

889
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,400
I knew it.

890
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:52,430
I knew it.
I fucking knew it!

891
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:58,612
- How could I be so fucking dumb?
- See, Dean,

892
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:01,582
you're not dumb.
You're unstable.

893
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:05,280
You're antisocial and you have a grudge
against society like your friend here.

894
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:11,453
Okay? Two freaks fucking pissed off
at all those rich college kids

895
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:13,860
they see walking
across campus every day.

896
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:16,956
Nobody's gonna be surprised
that you tried a thing like this.

897
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:19,194
Nobody.

898
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,032
You won't get away with it.

899
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:26,133
Oh. No, see, I don't have
to "get away" with anything.

900
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,700
As far as they're concerned

901
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:30,302
there were only two people.

902
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:34,282
There's the girl.. who's dead..

903
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,549
and the guy on the phone.

904
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,918
That's yours, by the way.

905
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:46,520
It's a shame about the plane tickets
you bought with this credit card.

906
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:49,190
You're not going to be able
to use those.

907
01:14:53,569 --> 01:14:56,732
I don't exist, you understand?

908
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:59,798
There's no trail, no evidence.

909
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:01,241
Nothing.

910
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,678
Oh, you're clever.

911
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:08,410
Yeah, but when the house blows,

912
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:11,476
they'll find something.. some trace.
They always do.

913
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,455
And you will go down.
You will fucking go down!

914
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:19,685
You will go down for it.

915
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:22,094
God, you really are stupid, Dean.

916
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:25,399
A bomb?

917
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:28,267
The transmitter,
the house blowing up?

918
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:32,866
Really? I just made that shit up
to turn you on, Dean.

919
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:37,669
See, I know everything about you.

920
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,203
Everything.

921
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:42,046
And soon they will too.

922
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:44,985
They're gonna know that you have
big highs and even bigger lows.

923
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,988
And that when the shit hit the fan,

924
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:49,081
you were always
gonna do that thing..

925
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:52,116
the thing that you've tried before.

926
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:56,792
The second time's a charm.

927
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:43,439
- Hailey!
- Daddy!

928
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:45,504
- Nick!
- Oh, thank Christ.

929
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:47,879
Hey, we gotta get out of here.
The whole place is about to blow.

930
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,147
- What do you mean?
- Your laptop, it's a detonator

931
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:52,016
and the modem's rigged with explosives.
It's a big finale.

932
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:53,885
- My laptop?
- It was supposed to go off

933
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:56,653
- like 10 minutes ago.
- I never bring my laptop here.

934
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:58,990
- What?
- Maybe that's what he meant.

935
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:01,963
The last thing he said to me
was to tell them

936
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,989
- the show's been canceled.
- Why would they even tell us that

937
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:07,867
- in the first place if..
- Probably just to mess with your heads.

938
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:09,530
- Oh fuck.
- Did you ever have anything

939
01:17:09,571 --> 01:17:12,062
to do with these people before?
Because they seem to know us.

940
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:14,075
These two kids, we think we've
seen them before around campus.

941
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:16,373
- Nick: Yeah.
- All right, well, all that matters

942
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:19,404
- is that you're safe.

943
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:21,006
Nick, it's them.

944
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,917
No no, it can't be.
They've got the money.

945
01:17:23,953 --> 01:17:26,751
- No, but they came after us.
- What do you mean they came after you?

946
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:29,349
We just escaped. What the hell
do you think we're doing here?

947
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:43,294
- I don't know him. Do you?
- No, it's not them.

948
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,842
Can I help you?

949
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:00,549
Paul.

950
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:03,183
- Dad.
- What happened to you?

951
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:06,354
There was this guy
at the gas station.

952
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:09,091
He had this girl
knocked out at his feet.

953
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:12,589
- That's the same people who got us.
- Anyway, I was gonna keep on driving,

954
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:16,229
but he pulls out a gun and tries
to pull me out of the goddamn car

955
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:20,367
and that's when.. anyway,
I managed to hit him and I got away,

956
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,400
but I think I got pretty lucky,
you know?

957
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:25,174
Well, come on in.

958
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:32,812
Thanks.

959
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,320
- So do we know who they are?
- Yeah.. well, we don't know them.

960
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,658
They, um, they held us ransom.

961
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:44,390
And they killed our best friend.

962
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,891
- You're kidding?
- Are you kidding, Hailey?

963
01:18:53,008 --> 01:18:55,533
Mr. Vincent..

964
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:57,374
I am so sorry.

965
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,513
We loved Jeff.

966
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,415
But there was nothing we could do.

967
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:10,992
- I think it's time we called the cops.
- I already called them.

968
01:19:11,026 --> 01:19:14,189
- They're on their way.
- Paul, what are you doing here?

969
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:18,632
Mom's worried sick.

970
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,897
You always call when
you're gonna be this late.

971
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:23,962
And I kept calling and calling
but there was no answer.

972
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:27,305
We heard it ringing, but they told us
not to answer the phone.

973
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,839
Listen, come on in,
come on in.

974
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:58,702
Hey.

975
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,504
Didn't Frank used to bring you
around when we were kids?

976
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:09,313
- Yeah, but then..
- You.. you had your own friends.

977
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:13,685
I just thought it was better
that we didn't impose.

978
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:22,559
Dad, it was in our house.

979
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:26,030
What?

980
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:29,060
Where they held us.

981
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,501
But you got away, right?

982
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,807
- Yeah.
- When?

983
01:20:36,845 --> 01:20:39,837
I don't know.
Three, maybe four hours ago.

984
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:42,282
No, what he wants to know
is did you get away

985
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:44,217
before he paid up.

986
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,744
No, Bob, that's not what I meant.

987
01:20:46,788 --> 01:20:48,653
There's just one thing, Nick.

988
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,158
Did you know your
big-shot daddy was broke?

989
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:55,187
- For God's sake.
- Bob: Now how about that?

990
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,358
But it's okay. I spotted him
a couple of bucks.

991
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,468
It's nothing, Nick.

992
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:07,905
Where are these cops?

993
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:10,707
We're a long way out of town, sir.

994
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:13,909
Yeah well, and in the meantime
these fuckers are getting away.

995
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:16,945
Where's my lighter?

996
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:38,606
We'll arrange for you to come down
and make a formal statement.

997
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,302
Any time, Officer.

998
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:44,005
I don't know what kind of country
we're living in anymore.

999
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:47,140
- What happened to our kids?
- I wish I knew.

1000
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,241
It seems like
every day there's a..

1001
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,309
That's just the way it is.

1002
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:54,049
At least your son's okay.

1003
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:57,183
You're both free to go.

1004
01:21:57,226 --> 01:22:00,161
Oh, and one more thing..

1005
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:04,957
we're gonna need to check
your car for prints.

1006
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,434
You can pick it up tomorrow.

1007
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,903
Yeah, of course.

1008
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,637
- There you go.
- Come on, we'll take mine.

1009
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:16,041
Let's get out of here.

1010
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,710
- Dick: And here we are.
- Yeah, that's about it.

1011
01:22:23,885 --> 01:22:26,012
Thanks.

1012
01:22:31,059 --> 01:22:34,119
Nick: Bob,

1013
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,289
why don't you let us
give you a ride home?

1014
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,629
You shouldn't be on your own.

1015
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,192
- Good idea.
- I'll call you.

1016
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:43,261
- Bye, Hailey.
- Okay.

1017
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:04,917
Nick?

1018
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:11,298
All those things I said..

1019
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:16,704
sorry.

1020
01:23:29,584 --> 01:23:31,449
Cigarette?

1021
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:35,248
All right.

1022
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:04,748
Are you okay, son?

1023
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:11,350
Yeah, I'm okay.

1024
01:24:15,664 --> 01:24:18,724
I can't go back there.

1025
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:23,632
You don't have to.

1026
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:28,076
Hey, Pop.

1027
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:33,472
Everything's going to be okay.

1028
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:36,848
Everything.

1029
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:43,685
We played by the rules.

1030
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:46,319
I wanted to play by the rules.

1031
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,398
But that's the big lie.

1032
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:53,230
It's not enough anymore.

1033
01:24:53,268 --> 01:24:56,669
So maybe,  just once

1034
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:58,297
you've gotta break them.

1035
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:00,700
Right?

1036
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
