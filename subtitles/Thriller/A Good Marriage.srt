2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,877
I fled him down the nights
and down the days.

3
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:12,851
I fled him down the arches of the years.

4
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,939
I fled him down the labyrinthine ways
of my own mind.

5
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:22,328
And in the mist of tears, I hid from him,

6
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:25,937
and under running laughter.

7
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,459
Come on, Darcy!

8
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:46,161
- Come on, babe, let's go for it!
- Go for it, Mom, go for it!

9
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,273
Is she hot or what? For
an older chick, I mean.

10
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,506
You talk too much.

11
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,526
What can I get for you?

12
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:16,276
So, what's up with the advertising genius?

13
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:20,339
- We got our first client last week.
- Wonderful!

14
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,740
Yeah, it's the biggest car dealership
in Cleveland.

15
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:25,523
They want a new approach. Something
that skews younger, so...

16
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,955
- You waited all night to tell us this?
- I'm sorry.

17
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,235
Ben, wonderful!

18
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:33,972
That's amazing. That's amazing,
you two kids...

19
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,244
I mean three kids.

20
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,146
Just coming all this way just to party
with the old folks. It's just...

21
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,553
Mom, are you okay?

22
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:51,346
I'm sorry, just...I think I do need
to go powder my nose after all.

23
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:05,556
You're the best. You're so lucky.

24
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,434
Got a good man, good...

25
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:11,188
couple of kids, and you even still
got your figure.

26
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:15,187
Your figure is fine, Betty.
Bob certainly noticed.

27
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:18,130
My mother would say, <i>Count
your blessings, babe.</i>

28
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:21,171
Oh, I do. I do.

29
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,403
You know that guy Beadie?
Over in New Hampshire?

30
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:28,307
He got another one. A
gay divorcee, like me.

31
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,291
- What do you mean? The...
- Yeah.

32
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:33,315
The news anchor on channel eight?
You know, the really cute one?

33
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,509
He said it makes it an even dozen.

34
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,010
She was tortured.

35
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,331
I don't know what I'm talking about.

36
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,124
- I'm drunk.
- That's okay.

37
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,203
- Go back to your family.
- Okay, are you okay?

38
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,082
Yeah. I just need a little
more time by myself.

39
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,962
Alright, I'll see you later. Okay.

40
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,015
I was going to save this until later,
but...

41
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:10,288
Happy anniversary, Mrs. Anderson.

42
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:15,380
You're a Pisces.

43
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,027
Oh, my God, Bobby, they're beautiful!

44
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,265
They're beautiful, thank you.

45
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:28,558
Hey, hey, hey, cut it out. Just save that
for later. Save it for later.

46
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,874
Let me try them on.

47
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,300
There. Now, how do they look?

48
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,881
They were made for you, hon.

49
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,221
- Would you hold that?
- Yes.

50
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,717
And we'd better get back in there. They're
gonna think we got a room.

51
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,290
Honestly speaking, I wouldn't mind.

52
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,571
Alright, ladies and germs,

53
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:07,089
what we have here is the best accountant
in our little company.

54
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,964
In the same vein...

55
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:15,475
Best damn accountant in the US of A!

56
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:19,240
And you want to know why? You want
to know why? Because he's careful...

57
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:22,323
Okay, because he checks his work...

58
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:25,332
And look out IRS, because when he has to,

59
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,855
he covers his tracks.

60
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,706
Enjoy!

61
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,628
Thank you for this.

62
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,651
Hi. I just wanted to thank everybody
for coming tonight,

63
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,476
and just take a minute of your time.

64
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:42,226
When Donnie and I decided
to have this party,

65
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,722
it was really as a way of saying thank you
to our parents.

66
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:48,817
For your love and support and for putting
up with us for the past 25 years.

67
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:52,148
But really, to thank them for their love

68
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:55,312
and their respect and their
devotion to each other.

69
00:05:55,987 --> 00:06:00,595
Through hard work and a little help
from their kids...

70
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:02,931
and lots of love.

71
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,375
My parents have created
something very rare.

72
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,530
A good marriage.

73
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:10,129
We love you guys.

74
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:15,223
- Well, got the house to ourselves.
- Yes.

75
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,073
We do.

76
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,859
Am I gonna get lucky tonight?

77
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:22,931
Well, if you bring me some fizzy water...

78
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,139
to settle my stomach a little.

79
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:27,187
You just might.

80
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:31,951
- Oh, I want you to be on top.
- Well, we'll see.

81
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,123
Here I come, ready or not!

82
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,745
Yeah, well hopefully we both will.

83
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,169
Thank you.

84
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,808
Thank you.

85
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,865
Bob...

86
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,541
Are you my bad, bad girl?

87
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,747
- Are you my naughty boy?
- I am. I can't help it.

88
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:49,523
I'm powerless over my nature.

89
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,691
I hope you're not powerless over
the long list of honeydews

90
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:56,038
I have for year 26, Mr. Anderson.

91
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,234
Come on over here, you naughty little boy.

92
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:30,675
That was terrific.

93
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,141
Good.

94
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:35,379
Happy anniversary, you naughty little boy.

95
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,946
Yay!

96
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,145
Okay.

97
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:56,403
A 1955 double-dye wheat penny.

98
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,539
Robert Anderson's great white whale.

99
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:02,949
Christ. Is that uncirculated?

100
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:06,803
No, but better than good.
I'd call it VG.

101
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,450
I found it on yesterday's pennies
from Heaven Blog.

102
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:14,962
The guy who owns it has it listed for like,
I don't know, $15,000, which is ridiculous,

103
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:17,446
but I think I could get it for 9.

104
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,409
Let me buy it for you. Let me,
an anniversary present.

105
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,947
- Like your fish earrings. Yes!
- No...no, no, no, no.

106
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:28,851
- Those fish earrings didn't cost $9,000.
- No, I know, but I want to.

107
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,899
Oh, no...

108
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:36,146
It's not the...look..look,
if I find it, then it's...

109
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:40,082
- Then it's fate, it's karma.
- I know, I know, but...

110
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:43,923
I just thought, you know, it's our
anniversary, and it's special...

111
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,274
But maybe...going once,
going twice...

112
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,128
I'm sure that one day...

113
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:55,474
I will find one in my change.
Until then...

114
00:10:55,858 --> 00:11:00,530
- Yes, you enjoy the hunt.
- Yes, I enjoy the hunt.

115
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,091
Okay. Alright.

116
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:09,554
- Great. They're home.
- Oh, you're such a mom.

117
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,721
I know I am. I'm just powerless
over my nature.

118
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,724
Does an accountant ever eat
a good breakfast?

119
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,851
- Good shot Ma.
- Don't say <i>Ma.</i> It sounds so ignorant.

120
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:22,834
Ma!

121
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:26,770
Ma Ray, Ma Barker, Ma Jug,
you went out last night Ma!

122
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,418
Always blame the woman!

123
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,362
Well, as James Jones says in
<i>From Here to Eternity</i>,

124
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,667
<i>God dealt women all the best the cards.</i>

125
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,162
- <i>Right between the legs.</i>
- Sexist crap!

126
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,811
- Daddy, I can't believe you said that!
- Daddy, it sounds so ignorant!

127
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,315
- Bad dad.
- Stop it, stop it.

128
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,834
- So when will you be back?
- It depends on the traffic.

129
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,474
I have to drop in on the famous Mr. Gaines
before I leave.

130
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,034
You're not crazy about my...

131
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,571
secondary career as a kingpin collector...

132
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:58,706
But I am the best accountant in the firm.

133
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,723
- Yeah, no conceit in our family.
- No.

134
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,315
Don't forget to thank him for
the tasteful toilet seat.

135
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,994
Will do. Right after I ask him for a
corner office with an ocean view.

136
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,347
- Oh, you're bad. You're bad. Goodbye.
- Bye.

137
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:13,203
- You take good care of my baby.
- Oh, you bet I will, Ma.

138
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:15,826
- Love you.
- I love you.

139
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,683
- Drive safe.
- I will, I always do.

140
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,760
Don't miss your flight.

141
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,809
Bye!

142
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,449
- Call me! Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

143
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,218
...and although police refuse to comment,

144
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:03,435
sources close to the investigation confirm
that elements of the crime suggest

145
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:07,636
that it was the work of the notorious
serial killer who calls himself <i>Beadie.</i>

146
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,872
Yes, that's right Dave. Marjorie Duvall
moved here

147
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,228
to the picturesque town of South Gansett,
New Hampshire

148
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,154
after her divorce five years ago.

149
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,123
Co-workers reported her missing last Wednesday
after she failed to show up for work.

150
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:22,597
Ms. Duvall's body was discovered
early this morning by a jogger

151
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:27,442
in this remote area of the abandoned
South Gansett railway station.

152
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,833
If this was, in fact the work
of the notorious serial killer,

153
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,319
police can soon expect to receive
Ms. Duvall's identification cards,

154
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,619
along with a taunting note
from Beadie in the mail.

155
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:40,690
About a dozen downtown businesses
were boarded up Wednesday,

156
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,857
and glass littered sidewalks following
two nights of protests

157
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,290
over the police shooting of
an unarmed black man.

158
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,459
There were few people on the streets
as the archdiocese

159
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,967
cancelled classes in two inner-city
Roman Catholic schools.

160
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:57,175
Police urged curiosity seekers
to stay out of the...

161
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:13,330
And me and mine have cleared
a straight path for you.

162
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,803
Aim here.

163
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,627
For the center.

164
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,409
Oh, no. No.

165
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:26,219
Oh, come on.

166
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,497
Poop!

167
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,729
Yes, he goes, but he never really leaves.

168
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,624
Let's see here...

169
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:36,048
These are mine! I was looking for these.

170
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,705
Male expiration.

171
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,279
Shit. Shit!

172
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:44,719
That makes an even dozen.
She was tortured.

173
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,481
Oh, my God.

174
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,449
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

175
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,582
- Hi, this is Darcy.
- And this is Bob.

176
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:03,666
We're not able to come to the phone right now,
but leave a message if you want to.

177
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,738
And if it's about collectible coins,
make sure you leave a message.

178
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,714
Remember, change comes from within!

179
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:15,291
If that's you handsome...

180
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,377
get your tight little buns over here.
My..my husband's out of town.

181
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:22,802
Very funny. I tried you before.

182
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,714
I was on the phone with Pets.

183
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,739
You know, she got home fine, and..and
Donnie did too. It's just...and she's...

184
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:35,218
just going crazy over those,
bridesmaid's dresses.

185
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:37,298
You okay?

186
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:40,946
Well, to quote the famous
Robert Anderson, I'm...

187
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:44,466
<i>upright and sniffing the air.</i>
How did it go today?

188
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:47,314
Well, I picked up 17 lady liberties
at a good...

189
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,834
no, at a great price.

190
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,682
As for that idiot's taxes,
the less said the better.

191
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:56,050
Oh, dear.

192
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:59,827
Your voice sounds thick. You haven't
been crying, have you?

193
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,050
Well, I just, you know...

194
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:09,074
After I talked with Pets, I just...I started
thinking about my..my sister.

195
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,762
You know, she was a year younger...

196
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:14,801
than Pets when she died.

197
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,538
Well, honey, if I jump in the car and turn
around, I can be home in no time.

198
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:23,335
No, no, no, no. Don't do that. I...

199
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:26,706
after the day you've put in,
it's just a...

200
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:30,962
I'd be worried you'd fall asleep
behind the wheel.

201
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,777
Are you sure?

202
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:37,121
Yeah, I'm sure. In fact...

203
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:40,371
did I...since you're in Vermont anyway,

204
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:44,786
Did I...did I mention that...estate sale
in Rutland?

205
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,762
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I checked it online
back at the motel.

206
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,450
Lot 75 steel pennies.

207
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,577
I mean...look,

208
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:56,242
if you're okay and I can square it with
Gaines, do you mind if I stay another day?

209
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:59,166
More time for me and the pool boy.

210
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:05,010
- Well, lock up tight.
- Always.

211
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:08,050
I know you loved your sister, honey.

212
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:11,371
Yes. Yes, I did.

213
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:15,537
- And I love you.
- I love you.

214
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:06,735
Beadie...

215
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,209
Incredible as it may seem, Beadie has been
living on this suburban Cleaves Mills street

216
00:26:50,305 --> 00:26:54,850
since the late 1980s, with his wife
of 25 years and two children,

217
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:57,864
who are just now finding out that they
have grown up under the shadow

218
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:01,538
of New England's most notorious killer.
Or so they claim.

219
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,978
Many are asking how much
Darcelene Anderson knew

220
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:07,184
about her husband's other life as Beadie.

221
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,159
She knew nothing!

222
00:28:56,178 --> 00:28:58,898
Ask yourself if you really need
one of these tonight.

223
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,482
Yeah, well, I think tonight I do.

224
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:55,055
You just had had to fucking look,
didn't you?

225
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,898
Any more coffee, darling?

226
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:22,073
Yeah, sure. Just a half a cup.

227
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:49,106
You know what, forget about that coffee.

228
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:52,369
It'll just keep me up anyway.
Just the check please.

229
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:53,993
Comin' up.

230
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:22,828
A slut reading a slutty novel.

231
00:32:58,322 --> 00:32:59,792
No...

232
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,126
Hi.

233
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,473
- You've been cheating at the candy again.
- Oh, my...

234
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,554
Jesus, you scared the life out of me.

235
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,317
As Moses said to the children of Israel,

236
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:40,466
<i>what goeth in the mouth today,
is showeth in the butt tomorrow.</i>

237
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,182
Bob...

238
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,546
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be in Vermont.

239
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:49,181
- We need to talk.
- What?

240
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:55,185
You come sneaking in here at 3:30 in
the morning because we need to talk?

241
00:34:55,569 --> 00:35:00,913
I lay for a while in that stupid motel.

242
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,993
After we talked.

243
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,737
And then I went out for something to eat,

244
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:11,669
all the while trying to convince myself
that...

245
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:15,793
what I was thinking wasn't true.

246
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:20,656
But I didn't get to where I got
by dodging the truth, so,

247
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:24,369
I jumped in the blazer and I hit the road.

248
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:26,897
Really? Gosh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

249
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:30,563
I really...I just don't have a clue.
It's and as for the candy,

250
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:33,137
you know people in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

251
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:37,970
Well, there you go with your
passive-aggressive stuff again.
You never change.

252
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:40,955
I can read you like a book, honey.

253
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:43,537
You're upset.

254
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:46,960
And it's my fault.

255
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:50,961
And I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.

256
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,970
You found my secret hiding place
in the garage.

257
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:57,713
I really have n...absolutely no idea. I
don't know what you're talking about.

258
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:01,263
You did a great job putting everything back
where it belonged,

259
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,961
except the box was a little to the left
of where I usually put it.

260
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:11,025
And I love that box, because, you know,
Petra..Petra gave it to me.

261
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:14,321
And there was a rubber band missing.

262
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:19,250
Beadie always uses two rubber bands.

263
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,409
Belt and suspender rule.

264
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:26,992
But...I found it.

265
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:32,337
Under your car. Which, by the way, needs
an oil change, which you always forget.

266
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:35,761
Sometimes you can be so smart
about some things.

267
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,514
And so dumb about others.

268
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,265
Like clearing the search history.

269
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:43,715
You always forget to do it.

270
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,441
- What?
- The search history.

271
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:50,572
It's the first thing I checked
when I came in.

272
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:52,994
And...okay,

273
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,737
I admit it.

274
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:58,929
I had a pudding cup. So I guess I am
a person that lives in a glass house.

275
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:03,439
Really, you checked my computer?
You dirty sneak!

276
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:09,681
Darc, I've been doing it for years.

277
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:17,521
I have a very bad friend that
does very bad things,

278
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:20,465
and when you're a man in that position...

279
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:26,449
You have to stay current
on those closest to you.

280
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,845
And since the kids left home,
that would be you.

281
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,873
And you haven't just been checking
on Marjorie Duvall.

282
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:38,031
You've been checking on all of them.
Whoops!

283
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:43,473
Who's...bad friend? What..what bad friend?

284
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,617
The kid I chummed around
in junior high with.

285
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:47,769
I told you about him after we were married.

286
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,913
- Yeah, but he's d...
- Dead, yeah.

287
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:57,777
Got hit by a truck chasing a baseball
onto the street. Poor old Brian.

288
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:02,579
You're not making sense, Bob.

289
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:07,506
I guess you'd have to be there.

290
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,323
There were these girls

291
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:13,327
that snooted us in the 8th grade.

292
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:17,550
Diane Ramage. Laurie Svensen.

293
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:19,409
And a couple of others.

294
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,312
Anyway, Brian came up with this idea that
we would catch one of them alone.

295
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:26,609
Well, maybe two. One for each of us.

296
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:30,096
We were going to say to them...

297
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:34,737
that if they fucked us real good
like they fucked their boyfriends
on Saturday night,

298
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,170
we'd let them live.

299
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:41,137
And this was...

300
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:43,217
this was all your friend Brian's idea?

301
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,529
Well...

302
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:46,877
Look,

303
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,734
those girls were snoots.

304
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,409
Like..like..like Betty next door.

305
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:55,217
Did you see the way that she was running
her tits all over me at the party?

306
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,414
Well, yeah, she was drunk.

307
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,657
Yeah.

308
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:04,113
But, Darcy, you have
to realize that...

309
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:06,970
I didn't kill those women.

310
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:10,609
Not really.

311
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:14,225
It was another person inside my head.

312
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,659
I fought it

313
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,918
for years, the voice.

314
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,806
And then I just...

315
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:28,273
I just thought, I'll do it, once.

316
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,737
Get it out of my head. If I get caught,
I get caught.

317
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,993
At least, at least it won't be
in my head anymore.

318
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,386
Won't have to think about it,
wonder what it would be like.

319
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:43,249
All these years, you've been fighting him.

320
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:46,033
Is that right? The Beadie inside you?

321
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah, yeah. I have, and I could
fight him forever if...

322
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:54,033
if I thought that there
was a future for us.

323
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:57,297
If there was some way that
we could, you know, just...

324
00:39:57,393 --> 00:39:59,481
turn the page.

325
00:40:01,393 --> 00:40:03,473
Well, if I don't...

326
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:08,497
I suppose that I become Beadie's next.

327
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:10,163
Oh, Darcy, come on.

328
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:16,337
Honey, this is not some..some movie
where the psycho husband

329
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:19,184
chases the screaming wife
around the house.

330
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:21,673
I would never let Beadie hurt you.

331
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,689
You know that, don't you?

332
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:28,946
Anyway...

333
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,775
Even if you were to turn me in,

334
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:38,064
I wouldn't lift a finger.

335
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,033
But...

336
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,953
But?

337
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,056
You have to think about the kids.

338
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,457
And you have to think
about yourself, Darcy.

339
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:51,985
Honey, you have to think about yourself!

340
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:56,017
Who is going to believe that you lived with
me for all these years and you didn't know?

341
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:57,841
- I didn't...
- Didn't even suspect.

342
00:40:57,937 --> 00:41:00,144
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, not once.

343
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,876
You know, and then you would have to move,

344
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:06,661
and the Anderson coin and collectable
company would be blackballed,

345
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,169
I can promise you that.

346
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,753
And, you know, then there's the kids.

347
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:14,992
They have to live with the shame
and the humiliation and...

348
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:18,832
Stop it, don't say that! Don't talk
about them when you talk about
this!

349
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:23,342
- Don't ever, just don't do it!
- Okay, okay. Can we..can we, look...

350
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,468
Can we just put it behind us, honey?

351
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:31,423
Oh, God. I don't know.

352
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:34,065
Okay.

353
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:36,672
Just let me think about it, Bob.

354
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:39,952
- Let me think about it.
- Sure, sure.

355
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:43,190
It's okay, I understand.

356
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,144
I'm really tired.

357
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,336
It was a long drive. It was exhausting.

358
00:41:55,857 --> 00:41:58,865
Could you turn out the light, honey?

359
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:01,840
Would you mind?

360
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,281
Stupid bitch!

361
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:33,585
Did you really think I was going
to let you live?

362
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:37,169
Did you really think I was going
to let you live?

363
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:41,060
Did you really think that I was
gonna let you live? Did you?

364
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,222
Bob?

365
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:45,231
Bob?

366
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:05,066
Bob?

367
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:04,119
I didn't kill those women. Not really.

368
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:08,374
It was another person inside my head.

369
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,195
Bob?

370
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:36,910
I just thought, I'll do it, once.

371
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:39,473
Get it out of my head. If I get caught,
I get caught.

372
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:43,888
At least I won't have to think about it,
wonder what it'd be like.

373
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:50,008
Darcy!

374
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:53,168
Darcy, I'm home!

375
00:47:53,264 --> 00:47:55,022
Darc...

376
00:47:58,225 --> 00:47:59,888
Pizza?

377
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:02,321
I didn't feel like cooking.

378
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:05,776
- Yeah, but what about your acid reflux?
- I took a Zantac.

379
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:08,304
Okay.

380
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,199
Well, since we're gonna be bad...what
do you say we have a little wine?

381
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,744
I'll take that as a yes.

382
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:34,300
I'll have another.

383
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,310
Wow, you took a couple of Zantacs,
didn't you?

384
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:59,440
That's the one you left upstairs
on the little table.

385
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,344
Did I?

386
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:04,881
Must've forgot that I had it in my hand.

387
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:08,209
I was going to cut myself an apple,
but I forgot the apple too.

388
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:12,686
You know what it's like when you get tired.
You forget stuff. It's mushroom.

389
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:15,343
- You have to promise me.
- What?

390
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,105
You have to promise me that
you're going to stop.

391
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,113
- Yes, honey, whatever you say.
- The most solemn...

392
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:24,529
<i>Never go back on it</i> promise.

393
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:27,344
I do. I told you that yesterday.

394
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,479
And we could never talk about this again.

395
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,697
I get that.

396
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:38,899
And you're not to send...

397
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:43,678
the Duvall woman's ID to the police.

398
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:48,340
I need more than promises, Bobby.
You dig a hole in the woods...

399
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:53,032
somewhere, and you bury
that woman's ID in it.

400
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:55,505
If I do that...

401
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,455
Are we good?

402
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:02,928
Of course we are.

403
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:04,831
- You're good.
- I am good.

404
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,219
- You're going to stay that way, aren't you?
- I am.

405
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:09,202
Good, that's settled. Go ahead
and eat your pizza then.

406
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,734
Oh, my God!

407
00:50:15,536 --> 00:50:16,546
That's hot!

408
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:20,687
Don't take such big bites and
you won't burn your mouth.

409
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,591
Mother knows best.

410
00:50:56,912 --> 00:51:01,649
And, Mom, I'm still waiting on 20 RSVP's.
And they're all his relatives!

411
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:03,679
And he says that they're coming, but
how am I supposed to know that?

412
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:07,200
- Why wouldn't they RSVP?
- Relax honey. Take a deep breath.

413
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:09,232
The wedding is still weeks away, okay?

414
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,953
Mom, I think it would've been easier
if we had just eloped.

415
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:16,240
Now that would've broken my heart.
And your dad's, of course.

416
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:19,344
- How is the old fella?
- Oh, you know Dad.

417
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,065
He's upright and sniffing the air.

418
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:25,342
Hey, have you talked to Donnie? Are you sure
that he's cleared his schedule,

419
00:51:25,438 --> 00:51:28,400
because...he's become this damn
success story and, just...

420
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,801
Pets, your brother will be there
with bells on.

421
00:51:30,896 --> 00:51:34,288
- And if he's not, your dad will...
- Kill him? God, I hope so.

422
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:37,040
Something like that.

423
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,592
- Alright, I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

424
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:44,304
- And stop obsessing?
- Alright, I'll try.

425
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,872
- That's a plea.
- Okay.

426
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:48,367
- Thanks, Mom.
- Bye.

427
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:57,136
Our champion, Sable.

428
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,495
Sable, and where are you from?

429
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,366
Sable's from Harlem!
Isn't that wonderful?

430
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,760
- Any luck finding the great lost penny?
- No, not yet.

431
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:48,205
But you know, all good things
come to those who wait.

432
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:02,032
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

433
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:06,800
It's...how long has it been since we've had
a..a girl..girl afternoon?

434
00:53:07,473 --> 00:53:10,928
I don't know, a couple of months?
I guess.

435
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,168
That's right, because you and Bob
are so tight.

436
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:15,439
- Yeah.
- I don't know how you do it, Darc.

437
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:18,863
- Honestly.
- Yeah, neither do I.

438
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:23,937
Oh, he's on the road, yeah?

439
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:27,053
Yeah, yeah. He's just in Portsmouth.

440
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:30,743
Some little stationary company got their
taxes all snarled up, you know,

441
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:35,152
and there's a coin show tomorrow, but...
you know, he'll be back tomorrow.

442
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:38,143
- Oh, with him, it's always a coin show.
- I know, I know.

443
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,056
Does he actually have any other hobbies?

444
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:42,567
- Let me clear these for you here.
- No, I'm not finished.

445
00:53:42,663 --> 00:53:44,112
- That's..that's alright.
- I'm not done!

446
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,191
- Sorry.
- Right.

447
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,055
Darc?

448
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:53,553
I'm sorry.

449
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:59,097
I'm sorry, you know, it's just the wedding.
Petra keeps calling every night,

450
00:53:59,193 --> 00:54:02,096
and every night there seems
to be a new problem and...

451
00:54:02,192 --> 00:54:04,592
Shit just rolls downhill, and...

452
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:05,936
- That's it, that's it.
- Yeah.

453
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:09,746
Exactly. And..you know, I just...

454
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:14,127
I worry when Bob's on the road.
You know, when he's away.

455
00:54:16,496 --> 00:54:19,376
How about dessert? Enough.

456
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,958
You're right, Bob. I can do it.

457
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:18,527
...friends have no knowledge
of the missing funds.

458
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:21,121
In other news a Portsmouth woman
was found murdered

459
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,816
in her apartment late this morning.

460
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:26,352
Mikaela Blake, age 42, had
been shot three times.

461
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,806
Police have taken Ms. Blake's
common-law husband into custody,

462
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:33,552
and sources close to the investigation
say he's confessed.

463
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:36,752
Of course, if the next one is Beadie's,

464
00:55:36,848 --> 00:55:38,671
she belongs to you, Darcy.

465
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:23,984
There's a fix-it muffler four blocks
down on Rayburn Avenue.

466
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,704
Maybe you missed it? You only go past it
every day when you go to work.

467
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,890
Yeah, well, you know.

468
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,494
They fix the problem, charge you
three times what it's worth,

469
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,344
and then point out six other things.

470
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,600
And then...some big snooty guy
looks at you and says...

471
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,958
<i>Hey, I'm just telling you,
it's your decision.</i>

472
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,944
Can you hand me the adjustable wrench?

473
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:55,760
Darcy?

474
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:58,268
You okay, Darc?

475
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,852
I saw you looking at Betty.

476
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:06,640
Yeah, well...that skirt
was pretty short.

477
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:08,365
It's hard not to look.

478
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:13,131
Well, then you're going to have
to try harder, aren't you?

479
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,664
It's a big week next week?

480
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:22,637
Petra's big week.

481
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,285
You want to hand me the adjustable?

482
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:30,293
I want to get out of here.

483
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,615
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.

484
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,576
- Honey, limo's here.
- I'll be down in a couple of minutes!

485
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,078
- I brought you some fizzy water.
- Oh, thanks.

486
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:08,976
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's wrong?

487
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:12,388
You look gorgeous.

488
00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:17,933
No, no, no. None of that. I'm going to
have to fix my mouth all over again.

489
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:24,432
But...thank you. Thank you.
You're very sweet.

490
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:27,694
So, go on. I'll be down in
just a couple minutes.

491
00:58:49,872 --> 00:58:51,463
Daddy...

492
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,624
Congratulations.

493
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,903
Quick, get a picture.

494
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:05,017
Brian, get over here. Come here!

495
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:50,736
Folks, ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for the father and daughter dance.

496
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:54,733
Let's get 'em out here.
Let's see them move, give them some room.

497
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:43,245
Okay, guys, everybody dance!

498
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:46,352
May I?

499
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,944
You may.

500
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:50,830
Enjoy.

501
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:07,440
Darcy! You're missing your own party!

502
01:01:07,727 --> 01:01:12,335
- Hi, I'm just rehearsing my toast.
- You'll be fine.

503
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:16,751
Honey, this is a beautiful wedding.
I'm so happy for you!

504
01:01:16,848 --> 01:01:19,949
Thank you, Betty. Thank you.

505
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,136
Bob...

506
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:31,760
I think he..he might have
a little thing for me.

507
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,776
Betty...

508
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,198
Yes, on a few occasions I have suggested

509
01:01:36,294 --> 01:01:38,571
that he put his eyes back into his head.
Okay.

510
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:42,991
I just want you to know that I have never
encouraged it and I never would.

511
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:45,904
Because you're my best friend.

512
01:01:46,096 --> 01:01:47,855
I know that, honey.

513
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:51,193
- You are such a peach.
- I know.

514
01:01:53,072 --> 01:01:56,093
You deserve every good thing
that's happened to you.

515
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,494
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

516
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:31,834
- Bob, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

517
01:02:32,655 --> 01:02:35,594
Nothing, everything is finally right.

518
01:02:37,328 --> 01:02:38,379
Oh, honey...

519
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:44,269
If I was a poet,

520
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:47,312
I could tell you how grateful I am
for this second chance.

521
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:50,995
To be here, to see all of this, but...

522
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,728
I'm just a lousy, coin collecting
accountant.

523
01:02:57,071 --> 01:02:59,003
So all I can say is thank you.

524
01:03:00,784 --> 01:03:03,151
Thank you so much.

525
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:09,455
Come on.

526
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:12,173
- We need to get back in there.
- Yeah.

527
01:05:16,175 --> 01:05:19,369
Mrs. Moore? Mrs. Moore?

528
01:05:19,695 --> 01:05:23,213
- Are you alright?
- Darcy!

529
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,632
- Petra?
- Darcy!

530
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:30,920
Darcy! Darcy!

531
01:05:31,504 --> 01:05:32,551
Darcy.

532
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:36,572
Darcy! Darcy!

533
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,205
- Darcy!
- What?

534
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,296
Darcy, you're never going to believe it?
You're never going to believe it.

535
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:42,312
- You're scaring the Jesus out of me, what?
- Pick a hand.

536
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:44,335
What? I don't want to play games, Bob,
what...

537
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:45,988
Come on, come on, come on,
pick, pick, pick, pick!

538
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:51,971
You read my mind. But you always could.

539
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:59,010
- Found it in the change bear.
- You just found this?

540
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:01,520
- Let me see this.
- I was just going through the change.

541
01:06:01,616 --> 01:06:04,399
Oh, my gosh. How many years have
you been searching for this?

542
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,709
Since I was 14 years old.

543
01:06:06,805 --> 01:06:10,604
- Isn't it great?
- I know. I'm so happy for you.

544
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,416
So, what do you think? Is it fine
or very fine? You're the expert?

545
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:17,743
- Well, I'd love to say VF, but...
- I know, I know, I know.

546
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,720
- But it's better than VG.
- Oh, definitely better than VG. Definitely.

547
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:22,598
You know what, if your dad was here,

548
01:06:22,694 --> 01:06:25,471
he would be cracking open a bottle
of champagne. I just know it.

549
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:29,648
Well, I will take care of that tonight
at Pearl of the Shore.

550
01:06:29,743 --> 01:06:31,151
Oh, Bob. I..I don't know.

551
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:33,967
Come on, come on. Put on
your prettiest dress...

552
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,006
I will buy as much champagne
as you can drink.

553
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:41,487
Well, okay. How about as much champagne
as you can drink,

554
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:44,368
and I'll drive home? It's
your find, after all.

555
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,246
Deal.

556
01:07:56,175 --> 01:07:58,445
Alright, one more time!

557
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:03,279
Yes!

558
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:06,410
- Am I going to get to be a naughty boy?
- Oh, you might.

559
01:08:06,698 --> 01:08:08,439
You might.

560
01:08:14,543 --> 01:08:18,174
Come here, come here.

561
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:26,126
Oh, I'm going to go upstairs and I'm
going to get out of this dress.

562
01:08:26,415 --> 01:08:27,949
And...

563
01:08:28,046 --> 01:08:32,285
if you bring me some fizzy water
and a wedge of lime,

564
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:36,063
you just might get lucky mister. But...

565
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:38,766
- it will cost you.
- How much?

566
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:41,615
For you? Just a penny.

567
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:43,373
Wait...

568
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,613
For safekeeping.

569
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:59,966
- I want you on top, alright?
- Yes. With the mirror.

570
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:03,757
Hey, now, hurry up, hurry up,
you naughty boy.

571
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:53,036
Here I come, ready or not!

572
01:09:53,615 --> 01:09:57,420
- Are you my bad, bad girl?
- Are you my naughty boy?

573
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:49,261
- Why did you push me?
- Maybe it was female exploration.

574
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:56,206
I so hoped that the fall would kill you.
I knew it might not.

575
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:08,623
Yeah, here I am, Bobby! Oh, I'm on top.

576
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:13,620
Just the way you like it, right? Right?

577
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:33,342
Okay. That's fine. That's fine.

578
01:15:33,437 --> 01:15:36,044
That's fine. I'm fine.

579
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,431
911, what's your emergency?

580
01:15:48,527 --> 01:15:51,839
This is Darcelene Anderson calling
from 24 Sugar Mill Lane.

581
01:15:51,934 --> 01:15:55,726
My husband just fell down the stairs and
I think I might...he might be dead.

582
01:15:55,822 --> 01:15:58,126
I'm going to need you to go over and
check to see if he's breathing.

583
01:15:58,222 --> 01:15:59,619
I already have help on the way.

584
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:06,990
For I am the resurrection and the life.

585
01:16:07,086 --> 01:16:11,502
And he who believeth on me,
even if he die,

586
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:13,224
yet shall he live.

587
01:16:14,799 --> 01:16:17,267
So we commit thy servant,

588
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:20,559
Robert Anderson, to the ground.

589
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:24,943
In the sure belief that the good works
of his honest life

590
01:16:25,422 --> 01:16:27,835
will recommend him to thee

591
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:30,314
on the day of judgment.

592
01:16:31,407 --> 01:16:34,316
Hang in, Mom. Almost finished.

593
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,460
Would the family like to approach?

594
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:47,768
Rest in peace, Pop.

595
01:16:58,382 --> 01:17:00,505
Miss you, Dad.

596
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,055
They were very special to me.

597
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:28,623
Then why didn't you put them
in the coffin?

598
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,396
I forgot, Pets. But, hush.

599
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:36,190
May the lord bless you and keep you.

600
01:17:36,814 --> 01:17:40,729
May the lord raise up his face upon you.

601
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:52,911
Nice dress. If it was any shorter
you could see her a...

602
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:55,758
Don't you ever.

603
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,311
Ever!

604
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:07,503
- She's just upset.
- Boy, is she ever.

605
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:12,302
Do you think there's any booze
in that limo? I could use a drink.

606
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,405
Yeah, I'm buying.

607
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:33,028
Thank you so much, Mrs. Anderson.
God bless you.

608
01:18:33,123 --> 01:18:35,118
You too father. You're very welcome.

609
01:18:35,214 --> 01:18:38,639
Some good comes of our greatest losses.

610
01:18:38,734 --> 01:18:40,588
If you say so.

611
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,552
Hello.

612
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:03,982
Mrs. Anderson.

613
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:06,415
Yes. Can I help you?

614
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:09,647
Yeah, I...

615
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:14,094
Well, thank you.

616
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,573
Holt Ramsey. I'm with...

617
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,671
office of the state's Attorney General.

618
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,718
Does RET mean you're retired?

619
01:19:20,814 --> 01:19:25,359
Well, I'm an old dog. They toss me
a bone now and then, I chew on it.

620
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:30,848
I think I've seen you. Have
you been here before?

621
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,152
According to the Hindus, we all have.

622
01:19:34,573 --> 01:19:37,813
Yes. What can I do for you, Mr. Ramsey?

623
01:19:37,998 --> 01:19:39,750
Inside would be better.

624
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,765
My, this is...

625
01:19:57,263 --> 01:20:01,197
a lovely home you have here missus.
Look...

626
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:06,030
a place for everything, and
everything in its place.

627
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:08,910
My wife would have approved.

628
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:11,598
How I miss her.

629
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:15,086
Just the way I imagine
I miss your husband.

630
01:20:15,182 --> 01:20:16,940
Yes.

631
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:22,510
What may I do for you, Mr. Ramsey?
I'm sorry, or is it Detective Ramsey?

632
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:24,846
Donkey ears since anyone
called me <i>detective.</i>

633
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:29,230
No, you go straight to Holt.
That'll do me just fine.

634
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,526
But, the thing is, I get bored,

635
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:35,253
just the TV for company, so...
I thought to myself...

636
01:20:35,349 --> 01:20:38,843
<i>I'll...what the hell, I'll take that drive
down to Cleaves Mills</i>

637
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:42,049
<i>and I'll just ask a few
of my little questions.</i>

638
01:20:42,878 --> 01:20:44,450
Here.

639
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:47,564
Have a look.

640
01:20:52,782 --> 01:20:53,993
Turn it over.

641
01:21:04,174 --> 01:21:08,782
- Oh, I see you do know my name.
- Indeed I do. Both your names.

642
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:12,104
Bob, Darcy. BD. Beadie.

643
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,419
Look at you.

644
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:17,615
Look at you both. Rubbing our noses
in it the whole time, weren't you?

645
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,713
I'm sorry.

646
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:22,382
There are twelve women
who are dead missus...

647
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,754
I'm surprised you can laugh at that.

648
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:31,067
Sit down. Sit down right there,

649
01:21:31,163 --> 01:21:35,692
and just be quiet. Troublesome man.

650
01:21:49,966 --> 01:21:53,006
- Never touch that stuff.
- You know you're crazy.

651
01:21:53,391 --> 01:21:55,342
Could be.

652
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:59,118
But I noticed you haven't
asked me to leave yet.

653
01:21:59,502 --> 01:22:01,326
I mean...

654
01:22:03,053 --> 01:22:06,094
I probably don't have much
of a case, you know that.

655
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,174
You have no case.

656
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,702
Doesn't matter, missus.

657
01:22:10,798 --> 01:22:13,774
There are ways, and there are ways.

658
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:16,846
Once I come upon this fella,
way far upstate.

659
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:19,790
Killed his wife, two kiddies.

660
01:22:19,886 --> 01:22:22,863
Tried to make it look like home invasion.

661
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,791
I chewed on that old bone.
Got a taste for it.

662
01:22:27,887 --> 01:22:32,558
Chewed that bone 'til the fella
got nervous and he ran.

663
01:22:33,613 --> 01:22:36,515
- And what happened to him.
- I chased him.

664
01:22:36,803 --> 01:22:40,559
Right up into the Haynesville Woods.
You know?

665
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:44,047
Where the song says there's
a tombstone every mile.

666
01:22:45,102 --> 01:22:49,614
Well, he crashed. And I crashed
right after him, and that's how I
got this leg,

667
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:52,366
not to mention this steel rod
that I got in my neck.

668
01:22:52,462 --> 01:22:55,183
I can tell you when it's going to rain.

669
01:22:56,335 --> 01:23:00,553
And the kid that you were chasing?
What did he get?

670
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:02,145
He got death.

671
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:08,588
Burned to death in his car.

672
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:14,319
Saved the state...40-50 years
room and board in Shawshank.

673
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:18,735
You are quite the hound of heaven,
aren't you, Mr. Ramsey?

674
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:23,854
<i>I fled him down the night
and down the day.</i>

675
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:26,683
<i>I fled him down the arches and veers.</i>

676
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:31,979
<i>I fled him down the labyrinthine ways.</i>

677
01:23:33,934 --> 01:23:37,263
- And so on.
- Did you learn that in school?

678
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:40,127
Methodist youth fellowship.

679
01:23:40,574 --> 01:23:43,558
I won't let you ruin my children's lives.

680
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:46,134
Well,

681
01:23:46,517 --> 01:23:49,295
if you think about it, missus,

682
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,495
it wasn't me put ruin in their way.

683
01:23:58,062 --> 01:23:59,970
You think about it.

684
01:25:47,182 --> 01:25:49,825
Go ahead if you want to, but...

685
01:25:50,315 --> 01:25:53,111
I don't think you'll get away with it twice.

686
01:25:58,094 --> 01:26:02,266
What's the worst thing that you ever did?

687
01:26:03,886 --> 01:26:06,710
Come on. It's just the two of us.

688
01:26:07,374 --> 01:26:09,689
And you know what they say:

689
01:26:09,784 --> 01:26:12,974
Two can keep a secret,
if one of them is dead.

690
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:17,015
And you'll be dead soon enough, won't you?

691
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:31,760
You recall that fella I told you about?
The one who killed his wife and kids?

692
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:37,315
Well, after he wrapped his Mustang
around a tree, I...

693
01:26:37,411 --> 01:26:41,048
I just sat and I listened to the screams.

694
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:45,034
For quite a while.

695
01:26:46,446 --> 01:26:48,957
Finally they stopped.

696
01:26:51,022 --> 01:26:53,519
And then I called it in.

697
01:26:53,806 --> 01:26:55,599
And who else knows?

698
01:26:56,558 --> 01:26:58,579
Only you.

699
01:26:59,054 --> 01:27:00,910
Because...

700
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:05,409
people wouldn't understand, would they?

701
01:27:06,318 --> 01:27:08,518
Tell me something...

702
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,124
Just what was it that you...

703
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,045
threw into the grave.

704
01:27:15,278 --> 01:27:18,603
They were the earrings that my husband...

705
01:27:23,854 --> 01:27:27,455
gave me for my 25th anniversary.

706
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:32,703
They were fish earrings because
I was a Pisces, he said.

707
01:27:32,799 --> 01:27:35,534
And they belonged to Marjorie Duvall.

708
01:27:37,838 --> 01:27:39,513
He raped her.

709
01:27:40,512 --> 01:27:42,602
And he murdered her.

710
01:27:42,698 --> 01:27:46,801
And stole her earrings,
and gave them to me.

711
01:27:48,782 --> 01:27:52,912
And I thought, <i>Oh, he's just so thoughtful.</i>

712
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:07,092
Marjorie Duvall's ID...

713
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:10,343
was in this box.

714
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:16,907
The box that his daughter made him
for a school project.

715
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:24,296
He promised to stop.

716
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:27,776
- Did you believe him?
- No.

717
01:28:29,134 --> 01:28:34,671
But I needed time to..to think, and...

718
01:28:35,438 --> 01:28:38,366
I wanted to spare my children.

719
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,123
You didn't come here to kill me.

720
01:28:42,542 --> 01:28:46,217
You never would've brought this if you had.

721
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:51,545
There's one thing that
I can't quite get by.

722
01:28:53,134 --> 01:28:54,783
The initials.

723
01:28:54,879 --> 01:28:56,946
B..D.

724
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:59,052
Beadie.

725
01:29:00,142 --> 01:29:02,936
Beadie was something else.

726
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:08,266
When my husband was a boy,

727
01:29:08,362 --> 01:29:11,855
he had a friend who was killed
in an accident.

728
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:16,333
It was a boy with...fantasies.

729
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:19,693
His name was Brian Delahanty.

730
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:23,181
I guess he didn't like his first name
very much, because...

731
01:29:23,277 --> 01:29:25,300
when my husband was a kid,

732
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:28,181
- he used to call him...
- BD.

733
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:37,037
Would you have caught him?

734
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,048
Oh, yeah.

735
01:30:00,334 --> 01:30:02,205
It's blurred,

736
01:30:02,846 --> 01:30:05,575
like it's two pennies.

737
01:30:06,062 --> 01:30:07,918
Yeah.

738
01:30:08,206 --> 01:30:11,039
Some people are that way too.

739
01:30:15,822 --> 01:30:19,519
I'll go now. And...

740
01:30:20,398 --> 01:30:23,125
You'll do what you have to do.

741
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,956
Missus.

742
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:36,066
The only thing I have to do...

743
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:39,498
is pay my taxes.

744
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:44,313
It's not for me to punish you.

745
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:47,416
You know your kids are gonna...

746
01:30:47,512 --> 01:30:51,713
talk about how much they miss
dear old...Dad.

747
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,519
And tell their grandkids about
what a fine fella grandpa was.

748
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:03,836
You're just going to sit there
and listen. Nod, smile...

749
01:31:04,068 --> 01:31:05,942
once in a while,

750
01:31:06,038 --> 01:31:08,905
even have to talk about the good old days.

751
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:16,848
I can live with that.

752
01:31:18,446 --> 01:31:19,399
Darcy.

753
01:31:20,846 --> 01:31:23,714
Come over here, close to me.

754
01:31:36,478 --> 01:31:39,410
You did the right thing.

755
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:53,547
Now would you mind putting
my music on for me?

756
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:14,190
All you big and burly men
who roll the trucks along

757
01:32:14,286 --> 01:32:18,894
You'd better listen, you'll be thankful
when you hear my song

758
01:32:19,278 --> 01:32:24,590
You have really got it made
if you're hauling goods

759
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:30,126
Any place on earth but those
Haynesville Woods

760
01:32:30,221 --> 01:32:35,373
It's a stretch of road up north in Maine

761
01:32:35,469 --> 01:32:39,758
That's never, ever, ever seen a smile

762
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:44,558
And if they buried all the truckers
lost in them woods

763
01:32:44,654 --> 01:32:49,133
There'd be a tombstone every mile

764
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:06,542
And if they buried all the truckers
lost them woods

765
01:33:06,638 --> 01:33:11,630
There'd be a tombstone every mile

766
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:13,878
Count 'em all

767
01:33:13,974 --> 01:33:17,196
There'd be a tombstone

768
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:21,916
Every mile

769
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:28,877
When you're talking to a trucker
that's been hauling goods

770
01:33:28,973 --> 01:33:34,014
Down the stretch of road in Maine
they call the Haynesville Woods

771
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:38,670
He'll tell you that dying
and going down below

772
01:33:38,766 --> 01:33:44,734
Won't be half as bad as driving
on the road of ice and snow

773
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:49,997
It's a stretch of road up north in Maine

774
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:54,446
That's never, ever, ever seen a smile

775
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:59,182
And if they buried all the truckers
lost in them woods

776
01:33:59,278 --> 01:34:03,030
There'd be a tombstone every mile

777
01:34:03,126 --> 01:34:05,618
Count 'em all

778
01:34:07,837 --> 01:34:11,021
There'd be a tombstone

779
01:34:11,117 --> 01:34:15,269
Every mile

780
01:34:37,582 --> 01:34:43,373
I can see you smile

781
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:46,445
And I can hear you

782
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:50,030
Say hello

783
01:34:50,126 --> 01:34:55,693
You're everywhere I go

784
01:34:55,789 --> 01:34:59,142
Such is my love

785
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:08,046
Even though I try

786
01:35:08,142 --> 01:35:11,415
I can't forget

787
01:35:11,511 --> 01:35:15,474
the way you sigh

788
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:21,101
My heart can't help but cry

789
01:35:21,197 --> 01:35:25,869
Such is my love

790
01:35:25,965 --> 01:35:30,798
I just go on

791
01:35:30,894 --> 01:35:35,278
Longing for your kisses

792
01:35:35,373 --> 01:35:40,244
Still thrilling to your charms

793
01:35:42,254 --> 01:35:48,660
I never spend a day without dreaming

794
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:53,605
You're right here in my arms

795
01:35:56,269 --> 01:36:00,125
If you only knew

796
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,943
The restless nights

797
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,922
my heart goes through

798
01:36:07,018 --> 01:36:12,589
I'm helpless, what to do

799
01:36:12,685 --> 01:36:16,109
How can I hide

800
01:36:18,765 --> 01:36:25,166
The tears I keep inside

801
01:36:25,549 --> 01:36:28,971
Such is my love

802
01:36:51,245 --> 01:36:54,679
Such is my love

803
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,219
The tears

804
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:04,652
I keep inside

805
01:37:05,197 --> 01:37:11,017
Such is my love
