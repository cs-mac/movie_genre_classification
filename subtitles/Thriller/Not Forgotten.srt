1
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:42,525
Glorious and powerful Death,
taking advantage of your kindness ...

2
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:46,925
I ask you this favour: as the invincible master that

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,245
you are, I beg that you vanquish my enemies,

4
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:57,761
conquer him who is conquering me,
like Jesus conquered on the cross.

5
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,290
Well done.

6
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,109
Well done, watch the way, Toby.

7
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:35,130
Take her to Melissa that there

8
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:39,272
In Del Rio, Texas on Saturday
are the days of football.

9
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:42,379
Fresh orange juice, people screaming,

10
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:46,658
corny uniforms,
and teamwork.

11
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:51,642
I used to live for those games, and one day,

12
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:54,091
stop worrying.

13
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,040
Good game guys

14
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:08,346
- Okay Toby.
- Not this.

15
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:09,739
It's just a game.

16
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:12,786
You can not always believe
as my dad says.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,089
The pretend that this is how you play,

18
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,716
but believe me he likes to win.

19
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,050
Take off your hands up and my cousin.

20
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:27,201
Girls, to the practices of this
Sheriff week will bring pizza.

21
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,956
But calmly.

22
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,105
Good game it is today.

23
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,010
It will be better next time.

24
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,634
Hot dogs are ready.

25
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:09,233
No coach, these are for me.

26
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:12,054
Thank you.

27
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,312
Good man Hector.

28
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,725
Here are the hot dogs.

29
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:29,830
Where is Toby?

30
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:34,444
Do not know, should be at
Here, you want that look?

31
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,692
No, I will.

32
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,948
Sorry.

33
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:56,176
His team is the best,
maybe go to nationals.

34
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:01,591
We just have to
finish the season.

35
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,975
Toby stay away from there.

36
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:00,931
You'll never here, okay?

37
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,810
But it looks great.

38
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,512
Believe me, that's all
thing less cool.

39
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,959
But Melissa says you
pray for what you want,

40
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:10,903
even for things that
not you ask the Virgin.

41
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,543
Want to talk about something?

42
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:16,012
You're a young woman.

43
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,102
Your mother would be so
proud of you in heaven.

44
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,425
"Toby you there?

45
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,332
- If Dad.
- Ok.

46
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,647
- Are the two in there?
- Yes.

47
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,417
What are they doing?

48
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,636
Father please give us one minutes

49
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,588
- Yes, yes.
- My God father.

50
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:51,994
Menstruation.

51
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:56,027
- I gave you.
- Yes.

52
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,447
Why not let the game a minute?

53
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,551
Dad,

54
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:05,277
Ok, sorry

55
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:25,209
On nights like this
my father used to say

56
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,477
What do you mean?

57
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:39,403
There are so foggy that even
ghosts need candles.

58
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:48,116
- Toby I hope this good.
- I will.

59
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,633
Some things should be forgotten.

60
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,036
That's not what I meant.

61
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:52,867
Good night I love you mommy.

62
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:10,456
Eyes on the prize, so

63
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:30,812
Then the contest this year,

64
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:34,384
demand a little
creed to follow here.

65
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:38,656
As the dog Dobby, and
a penny is not worth a diamond.

66
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,391
- The Bear Yoggi.
- Oh, same thing.

67
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay darling, sounded good.

68
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:48,758
- Yes?
- Yes.

69
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:52,552
Very good breakfast,
very well last night

70
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:00,396
Dad

71
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,202
- Take it off.
- No, no

72
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:20,150
- It's just lipstick.
- And the next thing will be a piercing.

73
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:25,635
Jack, sorry dear, you
that continue to shine for now.

74
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,977
- So you look better.
- For you maybe.

75
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,462
See you at practice.

76
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:59,439
As Yoggi Bear said, a
penny is not worth a diamond.

77
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,606
If good, I think that's all.

78
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,068
Then start

79
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,354
Thank you very much

80
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:41,827
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,078
What happens?

82
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,366
It's Toby, we can not find it.

83
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,923
We were kicking around
balls, and missed out there,

84
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,490
when we look back not

85
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,073
Hector, I told you you had to
watch them while I'm here.

86
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,932
- I know, I know.
- There must be an explanation.

87
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,722
Home if insurance was not feeling well.

88
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,348
- We have been looking for
- What about Melissa?

89
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,574
Over there.

90
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,514
Perhaps he was alone.

91
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,252
Wait, wait

92
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,425
- Jack listens, we find
- Where was the ball?

93
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,986
- Over there.
- Ok, thanks.

94
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,251
Perhaps we should

95
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:24,129
She will be fine,
this morning we discussed,

96
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,013
Insurance is
hiding for cobrármela.

97
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,095
In this same area is the border.

98
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,642
Watch this

99
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,081
If someone took her,
not that I will not know.

100
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:50,888
- She does not go away and
- Only a few hours have passed.

101
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,078
Toby will be fine.

102
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:56,547
For you it is easier,
it's not your daughter.

103
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:04,659
Sorry, that was not
what I meant.

104
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,626
Any trace of shoes?

105
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:18,869
Keep me informed.

106
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:21,639
The Department of Safety
Publish on line 2.

107
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,291
It's about sex offenders.

108
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:29,426
He talks Navarro, I
asked if they could send,

109
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:33,805
A list of violators
sex within a radius of 160 km.

110
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,894
Send it by fax in 5 minutes.

111
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,127
- Perfect, thanks.
- No problems.

112
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:42,028
What is all this? What sign?

113
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,582
This is the report
police officer,

114
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,966
and this is a request
more police officer.

115
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,501
Lord.

116
00:14:55,445 --> 00:15:00,494
Wendy, who had made the Sheriff
Fernandez in a situation like this?

117
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,456
You are doing well sir.

118
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,799
- How old are you?
- 11.

119
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,378
- How old are you?
- It has 12 in April.

120
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:10,504
A coat, pants and a shirt.

121
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,644
What?

122
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,266
I think it was pink.

123
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:14,533
Why run away?

124
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,556
- Do you have problems with alcohol or drugs?
- No, never

125
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:20,485
- Are you sure, and friends?
- Toby did not use drugs.

126
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,247
- How do you know?
- Why is my daughter, so I know.

127
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:24,876
- And the mother of Toby?
- It is an orphan.

128
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:28,936
When I was a baby, mother
biological died of cancer.

129
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,357
- Is dead.
- We were introduced.

130
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,944
- We have been married 3 years.
- Toby was our flower girl.

131
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:36,602
Born in Saint Margaret,
in Oklahoma City.

132
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,667
Do you have a criminal record?

133
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:39,947
No.

134
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,402
Did you fight in a bar?
- No, no, nothing.

135
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:45,853
- They have fought against it?
- Have you ever been beating his wife?

136
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:46,969
What?

137
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:49,196
- And Toby, ever hit him?
- Have you cheated on your wife?

138
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,768
- Have you cheated on your husband?
- I never cheated on my wife.

139
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:54,517
She is Karen de la Rosa, the
Victims Assistance Unit.

140
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,016
Hello.

141
00:15:56,051 --> 00:16:00,106
Before going there, you should know
that if someone took Toby,

142
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,768
anyone who has
fact may be seeing this.

143
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:06,470
It is important to be clear and specific.

144
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:10,315
Bishop Ladies and gentlemen, believe that
escaped or that someone took her?

145
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,380
Toby if you're viewing this right now

146
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,264
we love you, come home.

147
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:45,893
Please where whoever it is,

149
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:54,254
please send it to us.

150
00:16:54,289 --> 00:17:00,022
Please find Toby and
bring it back home with his family.

151
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:04,982
- Are you there?
- Sorry

152
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,267
In the name of the father, the
son and the holy spirit.

153
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:21,180
Thank you all for
come, God bless.

154

And thanks for organizing the prayers,
means a lot to us.

155
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:30,856
I want you to know that
the church supports.

156
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:34,240
Father

157
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:39,426
We do not know what to do,
Can we do anything else?

158
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:44,034
Must trust the
Lord, whatever happens,

159
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,512
will be the will of God.

160
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:12,482
What is that? Do any of us?

161
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:16,537
No sir, only boys, if I understand.

162
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,956
And our old friend Walker.

163
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,988
North remains in jail.

164
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:29,048
It is one of the victims to leave alive.

165
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,164
Long is registered in Eagle.

166
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,707
Did you visit?

167
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:18,183
Do not touch him, Dad.

168
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,484
That's him.

169
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,413
- Hello.
- Jesus.

170
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:18,532
- Long night?
- Now that I?

171
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:29,163
What happens then?

172
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:32,176
You know I get nothing.

173
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:36,395
Tupito rooted in a
the City of Mexico,

174
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,855
Santa Muerte is a mixture
from pagan rites and Catholicism.

175
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,369
Police say that is popular
among prostitutes and drug addicts.

176
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:46,861
Some recent killings
have been linked with it.

177
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:50,439
The Catholic Church condemns Santa
Death as devil worship.

178
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,862
Despite the efforts of
the church, the cult grows.

179
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,355
What do you think?

180
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:01,282
No alibi,
a van, alone.

181
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:05,484
What do you think I think?

182
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,215
- Security 24 hours.
- Yes.

183
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:40,738
- Any news?
- No.

184
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:54,552
There is an old crossing
the border in Mexico.

185
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:59,949
My grandmother used
take me as a child.

186
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:05,914
- She sees things.
- Please Amaya.

187
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,715
Please what?

188
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:12,480
These people only solo te
say what they want to hear.

189
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:16,557
How do you know? Any
Once you go with someone like that?

190
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:23,124
- No.
- So what if you can help?

191
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,966
What I am saying is that no
We have nothing to lose.

192
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:32,399
I'll finish this conversation.

193
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:35,098
Let me understand something.

194
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:39,212
Want to leave this to the will
Mr., as the Father Salinas?

195
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,418
Or do you want to do something about it?

196
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,014
Vera mother now.

197
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,843
He said that I am the daughter of Toby.

198
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:29,427
What? Is that all?

199
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:39,127
She wants to touch your hands dear.

200
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:24,268
That was a waste of time.

201
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:27,603
- Dear she saw something.
- Whatever was not Toby.

202
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,209
Damn, I can not park here.

203
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:07,301
Jack, this is the special agent
Wilson, Nakamura's agent.

204
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:09,836
Handled the case
from now on.

205
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:10,854
How about you?

206
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,647
We still take the case, but
the FBI will be responsible.

207
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:18,776
What can you do
can not be the sheriff?

208
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:22,901
Between them they have 20 years of
experience in such cases.

209
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,855
We have some questions to ask.

210
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:35,466
Of view was never seen
she was sick.

211
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:37,914
She was very beautiful.

212
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:43,348
They said the last time
he saw Toby discussed.

213
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,474
- She is 11 years.
- Is he gone mad?

214
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:56,310
That is not new.

215
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:00,126
Do you have children?

216
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,024
They know what it is.

217
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:10,158
And at work? Does anyone
with whom he takes?

218
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:12,964
Not all like them but I do not think,

219
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,988
I can not imagine
nobody could.

220
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:22,444
Then you do not know anyone
you want revenge?

221
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,024
Not that I know.

222
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:03,158
CONTINUES THE SEARCH OF THE LOST GIRLS

223
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:17,838
They found something.

224
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:21,372
We were sent this this morning,
parents who had a camera.

225
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,452
See anything unusual?

226
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:30,542
That is the father of Heather
and mother Peggy.

227
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,530
And the big guy in the background?

228
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:35,352
No, is the uncle of Melissa.

229
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:38,274
Can I return? Please sir.

230
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:45,904
There, the white van in the parking lot.

231
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:51,398
"Redd Holden did not have a well?

232
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,300
No sign of the girl.

233
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:02,404
They were told to watch over
this place over 24 hours.

234
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:06,627
- I only went for 5 minutes.
- That is what is necessary, you idiot.

235
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:09,263
Wilson you have to do this.

236
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:36,101
I do not understand, how could this have happened?

237
00:35:36,941 --> 00:35:41,876
How did they let him go
well? He must be watched.

238
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,198
Unfortunately it
mistakes were made locally.

239
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,910
You can say that again, a
real sheriff would not let it go.

240
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,681
That's not fair.

241
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:52,421
Casper, inherited the post
when Fernandez died.

242
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:57,258
Also if you do not know Toby.

243
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:00,575
This type has it, I know.

244
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,434
I can assure you that we have everything
we need about the suspect.

245
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:06,243
Not escape us again.

246
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,210
I have another question.

247
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:13,134
We're having trouble finding the
death certificate of his first wife.

248
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:14,981
Do you have a copy?

249
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:19,079
Remember the name
hospital where he died?

250
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:22,011
- Saint Margaret.
- What about the funeral?

251
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:27,635
- Give me one second.
- Do you know where they buried?

252
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,920
Do not remember where they buried?

253
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:39,459
- Can not find it?
- I tried.

254
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,800
Not to say, try again.

255
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,956
You know him?

256
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:19,927
No, why?

257
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:24,664
We did not see the first time,
I saw him this morning.

258
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,382
Nobody knows who he is.

259
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:34,347
If you've seen before, was
in the park the other day

260
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:36,785
was playing
lottery with some friends.

261
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,069
Did you see?

262
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:40,735
Yes, he joked about whether the
girls could go to the World Cup.

263
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,539
He spoke very fast, as laki.

264
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:48,197
- What?
- By Laki Indians.

265
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,427
Yes, know who they are.

266
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,302
I seek, I will send
a friend of mine in Mexico,

267
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:00,530
to see that you can find.

268
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,341
$ 10 at number 12.

269
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,677
Tremenda van friend.

270
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:17,463
My old man had an equal, is it a 200?

271
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:35,831
Ernesto Huerta, better
known as Bald.

272
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,820
Has tremendous history.

273
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:44,891
I go to the border, will you come?

274
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,369
Are the two of us?

275
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,676
If the FBI have a lot to handle.

276
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:53,839
Also have no idea of where we go.

277
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,425
It was a good idea, the laki.

278
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:01,759
Especially for someone
who does not speak Spanish.

279
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:05,292
A friend of the bank, the husband is laki.

280
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:09,167
If I thought it was Guatemala?

281
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:11,184
No, it laki.

282
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,968
Acuna, Mexico
- 3.2 km south of the border.

283
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:03,319
You have to go before
to give you another ticket.

284
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:17,465
This is my cousin's husband, Jack.

285
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,626
Sorry about your daughter.

286
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:22,758
Casper told me they were looking
Calvo called a laki.

287
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,693
They reached the right place.

288
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:28,101
Here stumble and do it with one.

289
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:32,642
Come, follow me.

290
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:47,864
Sorry, I do not speak Spanish.

291
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,476
But I'm Caroline,
the house in Tepito

292
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:51,647
Sorry, I do not know.

293
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,474
Sorry.

294
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:06,815
- Detective Sanchez.
- Santa.

295
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:10,236
My American friends are looking for a girl.

296
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:12,076
He knows that girls do not sell here.

297
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:13,557
Not that kind of girl.

298
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:17,067
His daughter was kidnapped ago
a couple of days in Del Rio

299
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:20,351
Kidnapped? It's pretty.

300
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:26,296
This is our
suspect, Huerta Calvo.

301
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:30,133
It sounds familiar.

302
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:36,339
'll Leave here in
If that sounds.

303
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:39,707
Does anyone work here?

304
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,554
Suspect in this week's
the 11 year old girl Toby Bishop.

305
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:53,798
The suspect is a sexual offender

306
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:59,233
The last time they saw
with a white truck,

307
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:02,303
670UHT plate.

308
00:45:03,651 --> 00:45:07,141
We returned to its regular program.

309
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:23,774
Tome.

310
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:27,687
- You want some ketchup?
- No.

311
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:41,456
They have so many beautiful photos of Toby,

312
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,765
but I have not seen a picture
Jack as a child.

313
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,270
Or yours

314
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:49,777
You got a day off?

315
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:50,850
Usually on Mondays,

316
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:54,310
but let me be the county
with the family long enough.

317
00:45:54,345 --> 00:45:57,697
And I want to be sure that
I do everything necessary

318
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:59,423
Karen, can you give us one minutes

319
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:06,701
What the hell is this?

320
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:12,144
I take off this place in the center,

321
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,332
know the bakery.

322
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:18,923
Everyone in the rosary was talking about it.

323
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,948
And just wanted to see what it was.

324
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:26,747
A lot of it is about revenge.

325
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,633
Do not want to get into that.

326
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:38,240
Did you think you will do that will,

327
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:41,266
if you're off the
people who took Toby?

328
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:45,376
Face to face

329
00:46:47,826 --> 00:46:49,788
kill them.

330
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:04,903
Where is he?

331
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:08,238
Who, who? I did nothing.

332
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:10,528
If, how did you do that to your face?

333
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:11,948
Espósalo.

334
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:20,311
Is this it?

335
00:47:22,218 --> 00:47:24,383
No, I do not.

336
00:47:24,418 --> 00:47:27,943
But Toby is always
exchanging things.

337
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:30,857
It can be.

338
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:33,681
Is that blood?

339
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:37,939
We do not know, we'll send
The laboratory of the state.

340
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:41,755
They are very fast, soon we'll know.

341
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:57,872
It is a wrong answer.

342
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,027
I told you, I never
seen that girl before.

343
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:08,068
- I told you.
- Remember this?

344
00:50:09,737 --> 00:50:12,196
The last time you were arrested,

345
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,369
.. your friends beat you both,

346
00:50:14,404 --> 00:50:16,756
you spent 6 months in the infirmary.

347
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:19,895
You know that with one phone call can
could return there.

348
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,094
If the result of
DNA comes we will know everything

349
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:24,785
so if I were you.

350
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,485
I confess all and save me,

351
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,301
other beatings, you know I speak?

352
00:50:33,942 --> 00:50:39,760
Ok, I picked up a girl at a bus stop,

353
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:44,596
she is escaping, it was good.

354
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:49,553
We have fun, things
outwith the normal.

355
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,525
Negative DNA is not our kind.

356
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,609
Where else could the
bad, scratched me and left.

357
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:57,870
But not kill her.

358
00:50:57,905 --> 00:50:59,813
And sure I have not seen this girl.

359
00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:41,937
Hey, this does not take much.

360
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:59,092
Thank you all for coming.

361
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:03,471
As you know we are here in community
to send a message of hope

362
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:07,697
Is not it strange that the
people become religious,

363
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:09,549
when things go wrong?

364
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:15,629
And surely the candles and
the prayers are a good idea,

365
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:23,102
but we do not know is that there
things that you can not ask the Virgin.

366
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:40,238
First I want to say that my
husband and I are grateful,

367
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:46,083
by demonstrations
of love and support,

368
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:50,116
we have received in recent days.

369
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:52,096
Guys please, we
in the midst of a mass.

370
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:53,353
This will not be much.

371
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:57,301
The hospital where I have to
his wife, Saint Margaret,

372
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:01,019
burned 5 years ago
is not any.

373
00:54:01,695 --> 00:54:04,576
We did not find the certificate
death of the mother of Toby.

374
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:06,748
They should write his name wrong.

375
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:08,699
Then his name also,

376
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,899
because we find their
birth certificate.

377
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:13,898
No secondary file,
university, bar checks,

378
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,817
even a
library card.

379
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,485
I've moved a lot.

380
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,465
According to the military Jack
Bishop did not exist until 10 years ago.

381
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:24,866
Am I being arrested?

382
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:29,043
- No.
- Not yet.

383
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:30,547
Please excuse me.

384
00:54:31,752 --> 00:54:35,827
I think my husband is going
Jack said something.

385
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:42,960
- What is it?
- More questions.

386
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:52,047
Hello everyone, Amaya already said,

387
00:54:52,082 --> 00:54:57,217
but thanks for coming,
means a lot to me,

388
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:01,367
in my household that their
hearts and thoughts,

389
00:55:01,402 --> 00:55:03,744
and in their prayers.

390
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:07,224
Toby says I talk too much,

391
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:10,440
so tonight, she'll talk.

392
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:13,585
This is something she
wrote in 3rd grade.

393
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,453
Life is like a ball of
soccer, written by Toby Bishop.

394
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,564
Life is like a soccer ball,

395
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,147
sometimes you lose

396
00:55:27,182 --> 00:55:32,907
Sorry I Navarro.

397
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:35,045
- Primo.
- Hey, what happens?

398
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,905
I have a clue about your cousin gringo.

399
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,245
Want to go?

400
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,403
It would be better than the two to come.

401
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:45,699
I'll tell you right now, get
there as soon as possible.

402
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,283
- In a couple of hours.
- The sooner the better.

403
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:17,189
Come, come

404
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:22,235
I feel that.

405
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:28,662
Jack, remember the girl that you
Paloma Blanca came in last night?

406
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:31,767
- No.
- The prostitute.

407
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:36,209
- Sorry.
- She said to meet him.

408
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:42,412
Well, she's dead.

409
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:45,750
Early in the night Carolina Sandoval

410
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:48,522
was stabbed in a
abandoned church in the city.

411
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:49,698
What say?

412
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,316
Was there tonight?

413
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:55,553
No, no, no.

414
00:56:55,588 --> 00:56:58,147
My husband was with me in Del Rio

415
00:56:58,182 --> 00:56:59,799
On the lookout with Toby.

416
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,489
I have a witness who
see a gringo said,

417
00:57:02,524 --> 00:57:06,270
who looked like her husband
within the church tonight.

418
00:57:06,305 --> 00:57:09,196
No, no, it was not.

419
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,787
She is in the other room,
Why do not we ask?

420
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,089
You know that woman?

421
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,431
Amaya never before seen it.

422
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:35,727
He sees that he does not know.

423
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:39,211
I'm not sure about that, what about this?

424
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:41,283
Have you seen this before?

425
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:55,418
Well, I was there.

426
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:58,338
But do not know any Carolina.

427
00:57:58,373 --> 00:57:59,619
What?

428
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:02,477
- Can I go?
- If Lourdes, thank you.

429
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,738
Sorry daddy.

430
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,541
Carolina did not meet for the first time

431
00:58:11,693 --> 00:58:16,214
knew, I came to see her.

432
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:20,286
And then something happened and kill her.

433
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:21,823
- That's not true.
- Is not that right?

434
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:24,471
Not true, it does not
step, I did not kill her.

435
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:27,965
I went to see her but I did not kill her.

436
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,932
I swear Detective Sanchez

437
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,935
- Amaya listen.
- Please.

438
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,568
- Do not touch me.
- Listen, please.

439
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,289
You have to listen to Casper.

440
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:38,323
And shit, this is my cousin.

441
00:58:42,557 --> 00:58:44,680
Why not start at the beginning?

442
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,146
"Arrested?

443
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:03,903
He did not, was only
in the wrong place.

444
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,778
The Mexicans went ahead of him.

445
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,940
Hey gringo, you want some soup?

446
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:16,553
Pretty girl.

447
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:43,351
Hey, do not touch me.

448
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:47,685
It was early.

449
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,665
- You sure?
- Yes, it was early.

450
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,028
Want to leave a message?

451
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:56,340
Give this, I'll tell him
at Hotel La Pantera.

452
01:02:02,123 --> 01:02:03,975
No, this is not my husband.

453
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,099
I fear that if Mrs.

454
01:02:11,253 --> 01:02:14,150
He tells me that this Robert Wyle

455
01:02:14,185 --> 01:02:16,922
- Wyler.
- Whatever.

456
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:22,775
That Roberto was born in Oklahoma,

457
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:26,725
but grew up in a
whorehouse in Tepito.

458
01:02:28,264 --> 01:02:30,777
- A collective debt?
- Yes.

459
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:32,312
No.

460
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,062
And a hitman for the Mexican mafia.

461
01:02:34,645 --> 01:02:37,520
I do not care what they say
Mexican informants.

462
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:42,493
This man is my husband,
I know Jack Bishop.

463
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,542
Jack Bishop there.

464
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,727
Apparently they will have to
wait a little longer.

465
01:02:49,253 --> 01:02:51,318
Jack ran for 30 minutes.

466
01:03:11,696 --> 01:03:13,574
Sorry, I fourth.

467
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:19,150
I need a room.

468
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:23,349
$ 10 an hour.

469
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:24,770
I need it for overnight.

470
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:25,774
20.

471
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:14,551
Hey, I heard that I was looking for.

472
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:45,130
Where is my daughter?

473
01:06:47,783 --> 01:06:49,423
Who do you work?

474
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,501
We ask for whom you work.

475
01:06:58,508 --> 01:07:02,384
No, just another contract.

476
01:07:03,476 --> 01:07:07,143
- Where is he?
- Fuck you.

477
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:12,259
I said where I was.

478
01:07:13,831 --> 01:07:18,043
Ok I'll tell you.

479
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,255
Your daughter is a whore.

480
01:07:28,414 --> 01:07:30,832
I was going to keep it to myself.

481
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:37,051
She is here at the White House,

482
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,297
on the hill.

483
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:44,945
If you are promised,

484
01:07:44,946 --> 01:07:47,561
already be dead.

485
01:12:40,305 --> 01:12:41,587
Where is Lorena?

486
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,908
- Tell your Katie.
- What are you talking?

487
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:52,071
- The kidnap.
- You're the kidnapper.

488
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:55,056
Do not lie, bitch.

489
01:12:57,618 --> 01:13:00,627
Nobody disrespects me
so in my own home.

490
01:13:08,143 --> 01:13:11,283
- I know you do.
- Stop saying that.

491
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:16,343
One day I woke up without husband or daughter,

492
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:18,493
not a damn note.

493
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,098
I did what I had to do.

494
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:22,581
If you are a saint.

495
01:13:25,246 --> 01:13:26,981
I did not want him to see
things I've seen.

496
01:13:27,818 --> 01:13:31,951
Poor Robert, you are
being the gringo weeping

497
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:35,398
the whore of her mother
left in Mexico.

498
01:13:42,776 --> 01:13:44,807
Just give me back my daughter and go.

499
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:51,507
Are you serious?

500
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:54,406
- Talk to Calvo.
- "Bald?

501
01:13:54,441 --> 01:13:56,807
Calvo told me that he had hired.

502
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:58,521
I know of no bald.

503
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,594
That's good coming from you.

504
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,136
Outside, seriously, get out, just go.

505
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,505
- Give it back.
- No where is, do not know.

506
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,624
Where is he?

507
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:20,505
Go back and was not here.

508
01:14:23,073 --> 01:14:24,865
You have to do this.

509
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,158
No, please.

510
01:15:15,826 --> 01:15:18,720
Amaya told me that my wedding day,

511
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:21,972
the spirit of my
mother would be beside me,

512
01:15:22,007 --> 01:15:23,951
when he went to walk around the altar.

513
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:27,249
There really was going to marry.

514
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:32,983
But tonight, I knew that
my mother was with me,

515
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:36,647
at each step.

516
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:42,051
O Death, Glorious Death

517
01:17:42,086 --> 01:17:45,639
Do not leave me without your protection.

518
01:17:45,674 --> 01:17:48,481
Santa Muerte is one of us,

519
01:17:48,516 --> 01:17:51,314
She walks with us, protects us.

520
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,521
She will overcome my enemies.

521
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,828
I am so proud of you Toby.

522
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:25,369
And now is the time for
know the truth about your mother.

523
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:31,810
Forgive me, O God.

524
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:40,018
Show me, please
show me the path.

525
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,795
I do not believe that ghosts
need candles tonight.

526
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:53,597
Amaya What are you doing here?

527
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:58,977
They come in light, with fire in his eyes,

528
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:01,603
darkness in your heart.

529
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:07,460
A crucifix falling, the red curtain

530
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,987
I said I was sorry.

531
01:21:09,988 --> 01:21:13,933
The blood running through his body.

532
01:21:16,317 --> 01:21:18,027
Why do you say that?

533
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:21,213
That night there was someone else.

534
01:21:23,468 --> 01:21:25,220
A little girl.

535
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:38,238
Look at the darkness
the eye and tell you see.

536
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:43,386
I see nothing.

537
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:52,831
He was a player, but the
was all she had,

538
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:58,410
the girl was forced to watch as you,

539
01:21:58,445 --> 01:22:00,463
and your dog, Katie,

540
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,017
blood collect your debt.

541
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:09,253
I was there Roberto.

542
01:22:17,315 --> 01:22:20,803
No, no, that's not me,
I'm not that man.

543
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,694
Well, I am that girl.

544
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:29,994
You went with the family
wrong brother.

545
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:44,463
You and you took Toby Calvo.

546
01:22:45,445 --> 01:22:49,789
You took my father,
the only man I loved.

547
01:22:49,824 --> 01:22:51,620
What did you do?

548
01:22:51,655 --> 01:22:55,013
And now I take that you love.

549
01:25:00,531 --> 01:25:03,804
Eyes on the prize baby, that is.

550
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,371
My dad thought we had
lucky to have escaped the fire.

551
01:25:25,304 --> 01:25:29,444
But I said none Amaya
of the two die that night.

552
01:25:30,799 --> 01:25:34,052
And one night when
still was too late.

553
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:37,448
He would know everything.

554
01:25:51,596 --> 01:25:54,404
Some people spend their whole
life back again.

555
01:25:55,147 --> 01:25:57,849
New cities, new
work, new friends,

556
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:03,236
but no matter
where you go or you do,

557
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,608
There are things you can not forget.

558
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:11,623
and others can never forgive.

559
01:26:28,482 --> 01:26:31,375
Santa Muerte conquer my enemies

560
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:34,952
and help me find
the murderer of my mother,

561
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:37,256
and to avenge her senseless death.

562
01:26:41,084 --> 01:26:43,199
No matter how long it takes,

563
01:26:43,234 --> 01:26:45,660
or how difficult it is.

564
01:26:45,695 --> 01:26:48,404
to conquer that
I have conquered me.

565
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:51,597
Like Jesus on the cross.
