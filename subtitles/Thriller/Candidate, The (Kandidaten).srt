1
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:57,071
No, man, your sister
didn't send me that check yet.

2
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,931
No, this is how you play the..
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

3
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,261
You just told us how to play it!

4
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,303
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

5
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:28,240
Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking..

6
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:33,722
- Four of a kind.
- What do you got, Melvin?

7
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,190
Yo, Melvin, man,
what you gonna do,

8
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:39,661
you gonna play the cards
or you gonna hatch them?

9
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:43,963
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to
run out to the ATM real quick.

10
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,466
There's gotta be a..

11
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:49,702
Gotta be a 7-Eleven
out there somewhere.

12
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,043
Let me get two.

13
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,429
So why don't we just go directly in.

14
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,963
Right up this route, straight in.

15
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:39,867
Yes, well, I see the captain
enjoys the road less traveled.

16
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,205
No, the captain enjoys
not going down the highway,

17
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,546
dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick
and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

18
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,786
It's very bad here.

19
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:52,389
It's bad here, it's still bad here.

20
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,621
And I've heard it's bad
right down here.

21
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,999
- Bad everywhere, huh?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,259
Mines?

23
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,600
Tricky. Swedish-made.

24
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,508
The man didn't say anything
about mines to me.

25
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,221
Sergeant Shaw.

26
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:20,731
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

27
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,197
Rolling in two minutes.

28
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:24,801
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,038
You okay?

30
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,436
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,338
Two minutes.

32
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,675
Yo, give me two cards, man.

33
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,639
Captain says we're moving out.

34
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,909
So..

35
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:10,586
Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.

36
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,364
It was just before Desert Storm.

37
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,971
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

38
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,972
assessing enemy troop strength

39
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:24,513
for what Saddam Hussein promised
would be the mother of all wars.

40
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:28,377
I'm in the lead vehicle
with Sergeant Shaw

41
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,786
and our guide, a civilian contractor.

42
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,792
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

43
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,722
Ambush!

44
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,108
Hang on.

45
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,978
Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!

46
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,754
Get a flare up, sergeant.

47
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,337
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!

48
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,008
Covering, covering, covering!

49
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,677
Bear right!

50
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,710
Move it, move it, move it!

51
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:33,595
Captain Marco!

52
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,274
Sir?

53
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,806
Was you scared?

54
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,516
Scared? Well..

55
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,148
..there was really no time
to be scared.

56
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,719
With complete disregard
for his own life,

57
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:55,562
Sergeant Raymond Shaw
engaged single-handedly

58
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:58,037
an entire company of the enemy.

59
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,181
Sergeant Shaw was awarded
the Medal of Honor.

60
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,875
I signed the recommendation myself.

61
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,882
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,990
Were you wounded?

63
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:14,388
I was, I was injured.

64
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:18,228
Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

65
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,866
Major?

66
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:23,763
- Yes.
- Did your unit sustain any casualties?

67
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:28,275
Yes. PFC Edward Ingram,

68
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,678
PFC Robert Baker III
were killed.

69
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,747
Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor,

70
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,585
is the highest award that any soldier
could aspire to.

71
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:42,525
What these brave men
that I've talked about today did

72
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:45,223
should never be forgotten.

73
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:50,808
Since 1917, there have only been
970 Medals awarded,

74
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,071
out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.

75
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,145
Who knows.

76
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,946
Maybe one day,
one of you fine young men

77
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:04,187
will earn that medal
in defense of this great nation.

78
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,421
Yes.

79
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:11,329
Major Marco,
on behalf of Troops 1094 and 1128,

80
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,198
just wanna thank you

81
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,271
for coming to speak to us
about the Medal of Honor

82
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:19,311
and about your interesting experiences
in the armed forces.

83
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:21,311
Thanks for listening.

84
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,380
Thank you very much.

85
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,318
You ever wish it had been you?

86
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,897
I'm sorry, excuse me?

87
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,002
Won the Medal.

88
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,664
Been.. Been the hero.

89
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:44,472
Well, sir, I'm just..
I'm just proud that I was there.

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,171
Thank you.

91
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,880
Thank you very much.

92
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,715
- Major Marco?
- Yes.

93
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,518
Al Melvin, sir.

94
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,289
Corporal Melvin.

95
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,728
From your unit, Desert Storm.

96
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:29,831
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

97
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:34,709
I have these dreams, sir.

98
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,513
- Dreams?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:42,252
Kuwait. It's you and me,

100
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,654
Ingram and Baker and..

101
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,786
..Raymond Shaw.

102
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,729
Okay.

103
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,864
See, I remember it happened
like you just said,

104
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,541
and then..

105
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,070
..I don't.

106
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,345
Well..

107
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,416
..we had it pretty rough
over there, Melvin.

108
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,782
That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.

109
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,323
Do you have dreams, sir?

110
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:15,997
Everybody has dreams, corporal.

111
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,930
No, not these.

112
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,070
No, I don't.

113
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,536
I write it all down.
You know, like, every night,

114
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:31,244
right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.

115
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,286
It doesn't always come together,
you know,

116
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,822
not everything that I can remember.

117
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,159
Maybe you should go
to the V.A. Hospital,

118
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,490
talk to one of the doctors.

119
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,861
- I've been to doctors, man.
- Okay.

120
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:49,708
I'm just.. I'm just..

121
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,110
I'm just a little stuck, sir.

122
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:57,652
Because I remember, okay, Shaw..

123
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,985
Shaw, okay..
Shaw saving us, right..

124
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,823
..but that doesn't make sense,
because..

125
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,132
..that should've been you.

126
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:11,466
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer..

127
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,967
..the Toyota is here..

128
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:16,908
All right. Just get up, get up.

129
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:18,604
Listen, it's..

130
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:22,811
That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.

131
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,922
What I was hoping is that,
you know, maybe..

132
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,285
You need some money
or something?

133
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:27,654
- No, no, sir.
- Wait a minute.

134
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,853
I don't need your money, man.

135
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,694
All right. It was great to see you.

136
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,232
Paper or plastic, sir?

137
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:04,504
With public anxiety being rekindled
by the events of Bloody Friday,

138
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,048
with the war on terror continuing into
yet another year, no end in sight,

139
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:13,017
the worries just continue to grow.

140
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:15,656
Polls indicate that
more and more voters

141
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,090
are concerned with
personal family safety,

142
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,322
with economic security,

143
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,594
fearing more and more jobs
going overseas

144
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:28,434
or being taken by
illegal immigrants.

145
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:32,704
They're concerned with the quality
of air and our water,

146
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:36,407
the degradation caused by the
rollback in environmental regulations,

147
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,919
by religious and racial polarization,

148
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:44,721
with the drumbeat of body bags
coming from all over the globe.

149
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,265
The American people are ready
for a new agenda.

150
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:53,305
But because this party is so
divided on so many issues,

151
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:57,537
the choice of a vice presidential
nominee may very well be

152
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:01,707
the unifying factor for delegates
at this convention.

153
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,715
And if this respect propels me
toward the nomination

154
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:09,361
as your vice presidential candidate,
I will be greatly honored.

155
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:14,431
We need to look inward,
attend to our own house.

156
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,865
The danger to our country is not only
from some terrorists at large,

157
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,909
terrorists who, by the way,
we've helped engender

158
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:25,080
with 20 years
of failed foreign policy.

159
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:30,086
No, the real danger
is from suspending civil liberties,

160
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,993
gutting the Bill of Rights,
allowing our fear

161
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,492
to destroy our democratic ideals,

162
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,635
because once we start overturning
our constitutional protections,

163
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,360
our enemies have won.

164
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,403
Raymond?

165
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,512
- There he is.
- Darling.

166
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:52,379
What, were you gonna make me
stand out there like room service?

167
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,729
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,
your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

168
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,834
she said you were up here
practicing your speech.

169
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:07,129
I don't honestly understand why

170
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:10,103
you insist upon
isolating yourself, Raymond.

171
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,438
People adore you,
they crave your company,

172
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:14,079
and yet here you are,

173
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:16,613
holed up as if you were some sort of

174
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:20,482
emotionally challenged individual
like your father.

175
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,425
Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

176
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,296
handsome, intelligent,

177
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,528
people-loving war hero
with a great deal to offer his party.

178
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,968
- No.
- And his country.

179
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,267
No.

180
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,205
- No, what?
- No.

181
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,935
I haven't even asked you
a question yet.

182
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,912
No to the question
you're going to ask.

183
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:43,176
No to all of the questions
you pretend to want to ask.

184
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:44,513
Your hair is too flat.

185
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:46,622
And no, you may not engage
in your usual backdoor

186
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:47,792
And that tie..

187
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,519
political thuggery to shovel me
onto the presidential ticket.

188
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,958
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

189
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,764
Oh, you're not interested.

190
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,942
Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

191
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,476
But not if it means attacking
the reputation

192
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,341
of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

193
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,018
which I am sure
was part of your plan.

194
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:13,989
Excuse me, when have I ever
attacked Senator Jordan, despite..

195
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:15,920
Despite what?

196
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,023
Despite the shameful way
his daughter toyed with you

197
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,464
that summer at the shore.

198
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,873
You chased her away, Mother,
let's not have any illusions about..

199
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,476
She wasn't in your league, but if that's
the way you choose to remember it..

200
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,875
You destroyed any possibility
of us ever..

201
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:34,541
Honey, you are oversimplifying things
a little bit, but it's okay.

202
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,982
I'll stay out of it.

203
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,521
You have my word.

204
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:45,156
Thank you. Thank you.

205
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,602
I think you all know my mother,
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

206
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,239
And some of you, no doubt,
remember my father,

207
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,443
the late Senator John Shaw.

208
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:05,986
I've been honored to serve
my two terms in Congress.

209
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,324
But I also grew up on the Hill.

210
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,730
I've seen how the game is played
by professionals,

211
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,700
how deals are struck,

212
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,206
committees bullied,
agendas bought and sold.

213
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,314
And with apologies to my mother,
I wish to remain an amateur.

214
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:27,323
I believe democracy
is not negotiable.

215
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:34,589
I believe that freedom from fear
in the world at large and here at home

216
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,133
is not negotiable.

217
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:44,211
I know how much Americans
have to fear today.

218
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,939
But I can tell you
that I've been there.

219
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:50,948
I've faced the enemy firsthand
on the battlefront.

220
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:54,358
I know what it is to be afraid.

221
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:58,594
But I am living proof
that we can win.

222
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,801
We can prevail.

223
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:09,302
We must secure tomorrow today.
Thank you.

224
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:17,986
- Bluffing?
- That was the inference.

225
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:20,319
They should be down on their fat,
white knees, thanking me

226
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,825
for saving this party from
committing political seppuku.

227
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,363
You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, senator.

228
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,969
No. I gave them one opportunity and
that was unusually generous of me.

229
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,896
See if you can get a hold of
Bob Arthur,

230
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:32,770
because I'm gonna wanna
meet with him.

231
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:34,535
Thank you very much
for arranging this.

232
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,510
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

233
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,345
- Mr. Secretary.
- Senator.

234
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,613
Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

235
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:46,157
- Good to see you again.
- Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

236
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,922
Buddy. Gentlemen.

237
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,195
No, I thought we settled it
this morning.

238
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,268
All right, I'll keep you posted.

239
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,445
The decision is final.

240
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,774
Thank you very much.

241
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,380
- How's Jeanine?
- Senator.

242
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,957
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

243
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,628
Now, we don't need your blessing,

244
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:13,888
but we'd like it.

245
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,095
Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just..

246
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,767
I'm dying to know..

247
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:28,443
..which genius hatched the idea of
pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

248
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,087
with a relic who thinks that keeping
suicide bombers off our buses

249
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:35,349
is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?

250
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:39,019
All the research indicates
that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

251
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,721
sits quite well
with the American people.

252
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,459
"Sits quite well"
translates into how many votes?

253
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,935
Your son is largely unknown
outside of New York.

254
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:49,666
I mean, his public service,
his congressional record,

255
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,573
while commendable,
is not the kind of thing..

256
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,748
My son is a war hero.

257
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,817
Governor Arthur has agreed
to consider Raymond

258
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,816
for a cabinet-level post.

259
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,512
We didn't come here
to have a discussion.

260
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,089
Did we come here
to have a discussion?

261
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,285
Ellie, you don't have the votes
to block this.

262
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,933
Not even to push the nomination
to a second ballot.

263
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,502
Oh, Jim, even running against
this cut-and-fold vice president,

264
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:13,664
with his party's record of
abysmal failure at home and abroad,

265
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:17,678
Governor Arthur is still unelectable
to the presidency..

266
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,214
..without help.

267
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,683
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

268
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,681
can hold on to his own home ground,
and the Northeast,

269
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:28,954
and even California,
we are still dead across the South.

270
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,961
He's not dead completely
in the South, senator..

271
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,795
And the Southwest,
where they win by landslides.

272
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,130
I mean, you know this.

273
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,738
Your focus groups,
your polls all tell you this.

274
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,341
They back me up, right?

275
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:42,105
Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get

276
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,214
the black vote, women
and college kids.

277
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,647
My gut instinct says he won't,

278
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:52,157
and on Arthur to somehow hold
the center, where he is soft at best.

279
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,921
We're confident
this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

280
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,623
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

281
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,529
Five points?

282
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,295
Three?

283
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,600
I can swing that, and you know it.

284
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,277
Oh, I could swing seven
away from you.

285
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,071
That's more than enough
to split the ticket.

286
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:11,149
And deny us the White House
another four years? No.

287
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:12,478
No, not even you.

288
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,055
Not even you, senator,
will do that, you are bluffing.

289
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,385
Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will

290
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:21,293
and I will do whatever is necessary
to protect America

291
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,161
from anyone who opposes her.

292
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,203
I can't..
Am I the only person in this room

293
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,136
who's been reading
these NSA reports?

294
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,675
- I've read them.
- All right, then you know,

295
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:34,973
you know we are on the brink
of another cataclysm,

296
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,210
probably nuclear, on our own soil.

297
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,648
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

298
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,551
And it's not from random terrorists,

299
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:43,090
but from covert alliances
of disaffected nations

300
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:47,459
who have all been made bold
by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

301
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,136
who believes that human beings
are essentially good

302
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,168
and that our power is somehow,
I don't know,

303
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:55,036
shameful or evil or never to be used.

304
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:57,838
Make no mistake,
the American people are terrified.

305
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:00,447
They know something's coming.
They can feel it.

306
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,844
And we can either shovel them
the same old shit and call it sugar

307
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,252
or we can arm them.

308
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:10,725
We can arm them with a young,
vibrant vice president.

309
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,389
We can give them heat, energy,
give them a war hero with heart,

310
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:17,936
forged by enemy fire
in the desert in the dark,

311
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,304
when American lives
hung in the balance.

312
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,400
Give us a few minutes.

313
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,898
Thank you.

314
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,374
Mr. Secretary,
thank you for your time.

315
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:50,213
- Thank you.
- Really appreciate it.

316
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:54,580
- Leona, good evening.
- Thank you, Ellie.

317
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:57,754
Well, they're gonna have to make
their own decisions.

318
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,827
I am proud..

319
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,956
..to offer into nomination

320
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:10,005
the name of the next vice president
of these United States:

321
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:13,702
Raymond Shaw!

322
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,677
A remarkable development.
Twenty-four hours ago,

323
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:17,579
New York Congressman
Raymond Prentiss Shaw

324
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,651
wasn't even being mentioned
as a possible candidate

325
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:22,620
for the vice presidential nomination
four years from now,

326
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,884
much less this current convention.

327
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,087
Some incredible news
from the convention floor tonight.

328
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,029
Like a long shot
catching the favorite

329
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:32,101
on the back stretch
of the Kentucky Derby,

330
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,865
Raymond Shaw has overtaken
Senator Thomas Jordan

331
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,943
to gain the vice presidential
nomination.

332
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:42,311
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage
of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.

333
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:47,088
Grandson of legendary industrialist
and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,

334
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,523
son of controversial
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,

335
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:53,096
who took over the seat
vacated by her husband,

336
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,561
the esteemed John Shaw,

337
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:58,466
when he died tragically
over 20 years ago.

338
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:02,334
For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw
is an enigma.

339
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:04,445
The millionaire
Harvard honors student

340
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,240
who enlisted in the infantry,

341
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,046
refusing the officer's commission
to which he was entitled.

342
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,984
Media-shy and reclusive,

343
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,125
Raymond Shaw's life
was forever changed

344
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,989
on the killing fields of Kuwait,

345
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:20,156
where he won the Congressional
Medal of Honor for combat bravery.

346
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:23,565
Two members of Sergeant Shaw's
famed "Lost Patrol,"

347
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:26,207
PFC Edward Ingram

348
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,504
and PFC Robert Baker III,
were killed.

349
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:33,172
Their guide, a civilian contractor,
disappeared in the ambush.

350
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:37,714
But Sergeant Shaw
heroically fought off the enemy

351
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:40,120
and guided the shell-shocked
survivors of the Lost Patrol

352
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,025
across hostile terrain to safety.

353
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:47,329
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest..

354
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:49,438
Most selfless human being
I've ever known.

355
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,040
The celebrated war hero,

356
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:55,009
who dedicated himself to
public service after Desert Storm.

357
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:59,117
The Medal of Honor winner, beloved
by the men of the Lost Patrol.

358
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,477
He quickly turned his energies
to public service

359
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:03,520
in his adopted state of New York.

360
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,317
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

361
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,397
which has literally transformed..

362
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,659
Captain Marco!

363
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,075
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics.

364
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,271
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

365
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:23,849
which has literally transformed..

366
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,191
- Captain Marco!
- Raymond Shaw is the most selfless

367
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:30,826
human being I've ever known.

368
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:35,433
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest..

369
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:39,071
Yet note the complexity
of the frontal lobe.

370
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:41,604
Nevertheless..

371
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,242
Captain.

372
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:46,510
Help me.

373
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,579
Sergeant Shaw.

374
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,048
Captain.

375
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:52,688
Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.

376
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,883
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest,

377
00:24:56,095 --> 00:25:00,759
most selfless human being
I've ever known.

378
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:07,300
Raymond Shaw..

379
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:11,810
Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.

380
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:14,184
Good, good, Raymond.

381
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,315
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest,

382
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:21,118
warmest, most selfless
human being I've ever known.

383
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:44,017
No offense, major..

384
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,961
..but it sort of chaps my ass
that we have to have a babysitter.

385
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,028
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get cornered

386
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,030
by some Air Force general's
unhappy wife.

387
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,302
Major Marco,
we should be so lucky.

388
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:56,973
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

389
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:59,507
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

390
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,009
Raymond Shaw.

391
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,943
Major Marco, this army of two

392
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,118
are gonna do some recon
at the no-host bar.

393
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:08,083
A failed foreign policy which has
only served to galvanize our enemies.

394
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:10,249
Excuse me, please.

395
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,020
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz
army of malcontents..

396
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:16,688
- General Sloan, you lead the charge.
- Absolutely.

397
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,961
William. Hi, how are you?

398
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,833
All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?

399
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,942
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Bob Arthur.

400
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,546
I mean, isn't that supposed to be
the point of this great country of ours,

401
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,549
that everybody matters.

402
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,588
Not just the people at this party.

403
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:41,556
But perhaps more importantly,
those who can't afford to be here.

404
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,464
- Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.

405
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,796
- Bob. You know my daughter.
- Tom, I can't believe it.

406
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,535
Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.

407
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:53,675
- Mark.
- Eleanor.

408
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:57,547
Raymond, your granddad would be
so goddamn proud of you.

409
00:26:57,755 --> 00:26:59,121
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

410
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:02,054
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,
from Manchurian Global.

411
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:03,319
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

412
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,088
And David Donovan,
their managing director.

413
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:07,664
And co-chair of
the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

414
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:08,995
Strong supporters, congressman.

415
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,870
They're desperate to be
of service to you, darling.

416
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:13,905
Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.

417
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,806
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

418
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:20,009
So, gentlemen, how's business?

419
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,208
Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.

420
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,785
It could always be better.

421
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,354
Any better and you guys
are gonna have

422
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:26,991
more assets than
the European Union.

423
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:28,252
Don't we already?

424
00:27:28,695 --> 00:27:32,427
Every great society,
every great civilization,

425
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,660
always anchored by a great navy.

426
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,531
- Congressman Shaw.
- Thanks very much.

427
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,607
Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.

428
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:41,872
Congressman.

429
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,347
Ben Marco.

430
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:49,249
I know. Hello, captain.

431
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:51,356
How you doing?

432
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,358
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

433
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:57,165
Oh, my God, Raymond,
it's been so many years.

434
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:58,834
- And?
- And I've been married,

435
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,230
- I've been divorced.
- Yeah.

436
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,406
Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.

437
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:06,203
No. No, that's not..
No, yes, I have noticed.

438
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:10,407
I see. It's great.
Congratulations.

439
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:12,108
My feelings haven't, though.

440
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:17,090
Changed, I mean.

441
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:22,061
What feelings? What?

442
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,601
Jocelyn, I have never
stopped wondering

443
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,037
how things might have turned out
between us

444
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:31,871
- if my mother hadn't..
- Raymond.

445
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,605
Raymond, people can't just
rewrite their lives.

446
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,517
I haven't had a relationship..

447
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:42,090
..of any consequence
since we stopped seeing each other.

448
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,761
Doesn't that say something to you?

449
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:48,431
Yeah, that..

450
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:52,231
That you must be just about
the loneliest person on this earth.

451
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,770
Raymond, we were kids then. It must
have been, what, 15 years ago?

452
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:58,105
It was sweet, but..

453
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:00,380
Joce.

454
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:03,812
Yeah. I have to go.

455
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:05,489
Yeah.

456
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,157
Best of luck with the campaign.

457
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,884
Thank you.

458
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,635
Joce..

459
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,396
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

460
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:23,638
I wanna talk to you too.

461
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:27,212
- Not now.
- Excuse me, sir.

462
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:28,909
I mean, I know you're busy,
congressman..

463
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,986
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

464
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm sorry, it's just that, well..

465
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:36,330
Don't ever touch me.

466
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:42,965
Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?

467
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,834
I'm told it rules.

468
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,946
What were you hoping
Congressman Shaw would say?

469
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,087
I don't know, sir.

470
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:03,326
It's not so much what he said
or didn't say, it was more of his..

471
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,160
..attitude, his demeanor.

472
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:06,932
Are you taking your meds?

473
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,334
Lieutenant Colonel Howard,
with all due respect,

474
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,509
I've had over a dozen years
of experts telling me

475
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,475
that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder

476
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,879
and every other mood disorder
that you can name.

477
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:21,522
In those 12 years,
I've been a good soldier.

478
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:24,784
And I've denied what
every nerve ending in my body

479
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:26,724
is telling me is more real than not.

480
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,263
I've had one dream,
not variations on a dream,

481
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:31,025
the same dream.
Night after night..

482
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:34,297
No. No. I'm sorry.

483
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:36,976
You're saying that an entire squad
of U.S. Army soldiers

484
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:39,112
was hypnotized into believing
that Raymond Shaw

485
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:40,871
deserved the Medal of Honor.

486
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:43,811
And that somehow,
thanks to your dream,

487
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,545
you're the only one
who knows the truth.

488
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,351
Major Marco, you will stay clear
of Congressman Shaw.

489
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:58,770
And you are to resume
your medication.

490
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:00,873
That is an order.

491
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,634
That will be all, major.

492
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:06,337
Somewhere right now, an
American soldier in the war on terror

493
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,882
is worried about his
family back home.

494
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,680
Somewhere right now,
in some small American town,

495
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:15,655
his grandmother is standing
in her kitchen.

496
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:18,422
She's got her medicine bottle
in one hand,

497
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:22,033
she's opening the refrigerator
with the other and she's thinking:

498
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:25,269
"I can pay for my medicine.."

499
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,504
"..or I can pay for my dinner."

500
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:31,472
"I can't do both."

501
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,848
I don't believe that our mothers
and grandmothers

502
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,114
should have to face that kind of
decision, not in this country.

503
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:42,356
I don't believe that the brave men
and women of our armed forces,

504
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:45,124
risking their lives overseas,
should have to worry

505
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,463
about their families back here
in America.

506
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:52,770
You see, there are some gaps
in this country..

507
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,847
..deep chasms
that we need to bridge.

508
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,482
The gap between rich and poor,

509
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:04,222
between government
and the people,

510
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:07,793
between true security
and the notion of feeling safe.

511
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:10,228
Second floor, room three,
end of hall.

512
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,192
Between what is real..

513
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:14,895
Don't you just love this guy?

514
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,768
And what is not.

515
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:20,573
Tough choices are an unavoidable
element of leadership,

516
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,341
I would just urge the governor
to remember that

517
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:27,113
the primary responsibility
of government..

518
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:51,383
Al Melvin.

519
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:56,354
Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?

520
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,502
Fox is in the henhouse.

521
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,433
Weasel.

522
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,943
Weasel is..

523
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,743
The weasel is a weasel.

524
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,149
Sir, I'll be right outside.

525
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:18,878
What?

526
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:21,753
I'll be right outside, sir.

527
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:23,961
I know.

528
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,224
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

529
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,462
- Shall I get that for you, sir?
- No.

530
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,835
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

531
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,704
You have 30 seconds, Mother.

532
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,274
Am I that predictable?

533
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,478
You have no idea.

534
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:04,445
I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.

535
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:07,621
I thought you were
magnificent tonight.

536
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,791
And so did all the network
campaign experts.

537
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:14,855
And that compassionate
vigilance thing

538
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:17,830
is working quite well for you.

539
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:21,563
- I might have to convert.
- I happen to believe in it.

540
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,297
Oh, yes, of course you do.

541
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:25,773
- Now, Raymond..
- Good night, Mother.

542
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:28,642
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.

543
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,880
- Hang on a second.
- What? Raymond?

544
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:33,650
Are you there?

545
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,725
Yes?

546
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:39,961
Sergeant Shaw?

547
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:42,060
Who is this?

548
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:45,896
- Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
- Yes.

549
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,833
Raymond Prentiss Shaw?

550
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,573
Yes.

551
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,217
Listen.

552
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,346
Go to the bedroom of your suite.

553
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,255
Enter the hallway there.

554
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:07,058
Go to the end and open the closet.

555
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:38,568
Yes, thank you.

556
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:43,773
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello.

557
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,881
Do you remember me?

558
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,058
No, sir, I don't.

559
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,887
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes
for our little checkup

560
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,930
from the neck up, gentlemen,
so if we could take his jacket.

561
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:00,034
Please sit down.

562
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,702
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just..
The Army's got me gathering

563
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,812
information on stress disorders,
so I'm just..

564
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:12,448
..you know, just running statistics,
trying to find out about my old team..

565
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:18,282
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

566
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:23,055
when Nathan came home,
was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

567
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,893
I mean, did he have nightmares
or bad dreams

568
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,796
about the firefight over there?

569
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:36,208
You'll feel a little cold
as this anesthetic gel goes on.

570
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,488
Probe sheath..

571
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:46,526
..and probe.

572
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:52,569
Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?

573
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:53,897
Yes, sir.

574
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:58,907
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill
a tiny hole in the skull,

575
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:03,015
which will allow delivery
of the new implant.

576
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:06,680
So, what you'll feel is a little
discomfort in the form of pressure

577
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,291
and also a loud vibrating noise
in your head,

578
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,453
all of which, of course,
is completely normal.

579
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:16,925
Thank you.

580
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:22,466
Of course, as soon as this
or any task is completed,

581
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:27,573
you will already have forgotten
that it ever actually took place.

582
00:39:28,476 --> 00:39:30,468
Probe going in now.

583
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,623
Good.

584
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:45,227
Excellent.

585
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:47,867
Releasing implant.

586
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,560
There. That wasn't so bad,
was it, Raymond?

587
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:52,070
No, sir.

588
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:55,040
That's good. No decay, no slippage.

589
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:59,444
Everything seems to be
in flawless working condition.

590
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:27,252
Now, Raymond.

591
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:31,050
Can you remember the deaths
of Private Baker and Private Ingram?

592
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,248
Yes, sir.

593
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,985
Good. Can you describe them
for me, please?

594
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:38,258
We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

595
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:40,960
assessing troop strength.

596
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:46,778
"We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

597
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,345
assessing troop strength."

598
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,177
The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back..

599
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,150
"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars.."

600
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,758
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

601
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:59,591
The patrol is ambushed.

602
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:03,029
We're engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support.

603
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:06,069
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

604
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:07,964
"Captain.."

605
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:11,909
Captain Marco
is knocked unconscious.

606
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:16,050
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

607
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:18,948
Baker goes after him.

608
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:21,249
An incoming mortar shell
kills them both instantly

609
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,896
before I am able to locate and
eliminate the source of the ordnance.

610
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:30,100
Captain. Captain Marco.

611
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:31,771
Help me.

612
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:42,284
Pardon me. Is this seat taken?

613
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,448
I see the captain enjoys
the road less traveled.

614
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:06,007
Paper or plastic?

615
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:11,287
Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.

616
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:14,485
You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.

617
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:16,163
"Paper or plastic, sir?"

618
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,266
I see you there all the time.

619
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:21,959
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

620
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,975
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

621
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,849
So anyway, I'm on vacation.

622
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:36,250
Holiday in the Big Apple
and all of that.

623
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:38,892
And I saw you sitting here
and I said, "Hey",

624
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:41,962
"why not reach out
and touch someone?"

625
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,671
So, what, I suppose
you're heading to New York City.

626
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:51,001
Yeah, yeah, I'm.. Yeah.

627
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:54,045
Business? Pleasure? Both?

628
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:59,411
Well, I'm just.. I got an old friend
up there, an old Army friend that..

629
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:03,257
Well, he's in politics now
and I'm just gonna

630
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,793
catch up on old times with him.

631
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:11,326
I'm sorry, you said your name was..?

632
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:13,671
Eugenie.

633
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,267
What do your friends call you?

634
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:18,605
My friends, they call me Rosie.

635
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,039
- Rosie?
- Yeah, see, my full name is

636
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,808
Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.

637
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,750
Eugenie is, well..

638
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:27,848
..fragile.

639
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:31,424
Yeah, but still, when I asked you
your name, you didn't say..

640
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:33,763
What did you say?
You said Eugenie.

641
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:36,162
Yeah, well..

642
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:41,437
..maybe I was feeling fragile
at the time.

643
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:52,222
Are you okay?

644
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,756
Excuse me.

645
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:43,322
Hello, captain.

646
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:45,492
Do you remember me?

647
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:19,068
Ben.

648
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:23,432
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?

649
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:24,840
No, I'm okay.

650
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:26,844
Okay. So your friend's
gonna meet you here, then?

651
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:28,415
No.

652
00:45:29,986 --> 00:45:31,386
All right.

653
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:34,616
El Dorado 59970.

654
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:40,831
It's my cell phone number,
in case you ever.. You know.

655
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:43,026
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

656
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:46,605
Can you remember or should I write it
on your chest with a Sharpie?

657
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:49,706
- I'll remember.
- Okay.

658
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,746
Hey, you're kind of..

659
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,909
You need somewhere to go
to freshen up?

660
00:45:57,723 --> 00:45:59,384
Pentagon watchdogs
today accused

661
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:01,993
the private equity fund
Manchurian Global

662
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:06,030
of grossly overpricing plasma
and other critical medical supplies

663
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:08,327
during the recent
Indonesian incursion,

664
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:12,805
even as the company secured
a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract

665
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,139
to provide combat support services
to American soldiers

666
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:18,543
preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.

667
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:32,864
There you go.

668
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,036
Come on in.

669
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,799
This is my cousin's apartment.

670
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:40,143
- Is she here?
- No.

671
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:42,405
Be it ever so humble.

672
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:45,046
No place like home, right?

673
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:48,483
Believe it or not, there's a view.

674
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,785
Go to the fire escape
and tilt your head up,

675
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:54,224
you can almost see a tree.

676
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:58,666
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

677
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:04,071
I've got some dieter's tea.

678
00:47:04,277 --> 00:47:07,907
It's great for your metabolism,
if you're into that.

679
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:13,077
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

680
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:15,418
Or..

681
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,718
..some water?

682
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:19,322
- No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.

683
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:22,924
I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.

684
00:47:24,037 --> 00:47:25,800
Where is she, your cousin?

685
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,109
She's on tour with Dreamgirls.

686
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:41,586
Hey, are you okay?

687
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,595
Yeah.

688
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:51,463
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

689
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:54,199
You don't have to apologize to me.

690
00:47:55,244 --> 00:47:57,407
I'll make you some tea.

691
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:39,958
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

692
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:44,369
- You okay in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

693
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:48,277
You know, I left you some towels
in there, did you see them?

694
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:54,380
- What was that?
- Dropped my bag.

695
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:03,466
Ben?

696
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,533
Are you okay in there?

697
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:08,337
Earth to Ben.

698
00:49:09,075 --> 00:49:10,440
Yeah.

699
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:13,875
- You sure everything's all right?
- Yes.

700
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:18,310
Ben?

701
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:29,360
Ben?

702
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,833
Ben?

703
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:33,934
Ben.

704
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:39,847
Ben?

705
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,778
What are you doing?

706
00:50:09,187 --> 00:50:10,882
Did you see that?

707
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,822
What I had in my hand.

708
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:23,737
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.
I held it in my hand.

709
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:26,307
That's what they all say, Marco.

710
00:50:26,543 --> 00:50:29,604
Some wicked shit got sprayed
on you guys during Desert Storm.

711
00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:33,311
Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.

712
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:36,046
I personally know of
a couple of Rangers

713
00:50:36,256 --> 00:50:39,022
who swear that they see only
in tertiary colors now,

714
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:42,288
- Delp.
- And can pick up sports talk radio

715
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,957
in their cortical block if they get
too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

716
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,271
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

717
00:50:55,115 --> 00:51:01,249
The Army did try this
tiny, implantable ID thing.

718
00:51:03,058 --> 00:51:06,119
You could imbed it under the skin,
then scan it like a bar code

719
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,958
for medical emergency information:

720
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,631
Blood type, DNA.

721
00:51:11,837 --> 00:51:13,897
Well, the Army never put one in me.

722
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,976
That you know of, man.

723
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:24,249
That you know of.

724
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:38,233
U.S. Planes bombed selected sites
in Guinea today, acting on intelligence

725
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:41,807
that the African nation's military
regime had secretly resumed

726
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,638
its chemical weapons program.

727
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:46,041
The secretary of defense declined
to comment on the attack,

728
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:48,150
saying only that the mission
was successful,

729
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:51,379
targets acquired, that all American
personnel involved here

730
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:55,026
- were home safe and sound.
- Striking transportation workers..

731
00:51:56,229 --> 00:52:00,633
My dreams seem more real to me

732
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:04,237
than what I actually remember
happening over there. It's like..

733
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:11,916
It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and..

734
00:52:14,286 --> 00:52:17,051
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

735
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:20,250
We have all been
brainwashed, Marco.

736
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:24,831
As for somebody
imbedding electric probes

737
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:29,597
and computer chips in your brain
to make you do things,

738
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,672
it's horseshit, man.

739
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:35,846
A little electroshock..

740
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:40,344
..and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price.

741
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:42,545
Ask the Uzbeks.

742
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:45,726
What about my dreams?

743
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:50,261
What if all this is your dream..

744
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,304
..and you are really
still back in Kuwait?

745
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,400
- Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
- Congressman!

746
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,166
- Congressman!
- Congressman!

747
00:53:23,378 --> 00:53:26,040
Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur

748
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:28,044
oppose deploying troops
into Indonesia?

749
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:29,718
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

750
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,649
we can't clean up the world
with dirty hands.

751
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:33,517
Sergeant Shaw!

752
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:36,989
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

753
00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:39,126
Captain Marco.

754
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:42,798
It's okay. It's okay.

755
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:44,493
Nice to see you, sir.

756
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:47,139
Good evening.
It's good to see you too.

757
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:48,910
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

758
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,601
I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.

759
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:52,111
- Thank you, Lily.
- Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

760
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,682
They wanna know if you can do
an interview with Larry King at 6?

761
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,444
- No, no.
- No to the interview or no to 6?

762
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,144
No. He wants to talk
about my mother. No.

763
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:00,188
- Everything under control, P.J.?
- Hello, sir.

764
00:54:00,426 --> 00:54:02,122
Good to see you.

765
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:04,330
So, captain, what can I do for you?

766
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:05,965
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

767
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,429
Congressman Shaw,
a moment, please?

768
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:08,603
Private time.

769
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:11,501
Unfortunately, this is as private
as it gets for me now.

770
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,232
- I understand.
- He's all right, Will.

771
00:54:13,443 --> 00:54:15,469
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

772
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:19,678
- Hey, George.
- There are these dreams

773
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:22,649
that some of the men
from our unit have been having.

774
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:24,187
Including you?

775
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:25,688
Well..

776
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:29,354
..it's more of a question
of what actually happened

777
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:31,590
the night that our patrol
got attacked.

778
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:36,401
That's easy. We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain.

779
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,235
The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

780
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,675
- You're knocked..
- Unconscious. Exactly the way..

781
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,817
Not to cut you off, but I mean,
exactly the way that I remember it.

782
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:47,853
But I dreamed something else.

783
00:54:49,457 --> 00:54:50,948
Am I in your dreams, captain?

784
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:53,486
Yes, you are, congressman.

785
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:54,955
Saving everybody?

786
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:58,157
It's a whole lot more complicated
than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

787
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:00,838
he's been drawing these pictures
and he wrote down what he dreams.

788
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,974
- Maybe if you just..
- I don't have dreams, captain.

789
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,812
At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean..

790
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:09,346
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would,

791
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,347
but I think you ought to
see somebody.

792
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:13,613
- Somebody who specializes in..
- I've been to doctors.

793
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:15,715
Well, good, that's very good,

794
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:18,486
because they can probably
help you out a lot more than I can.

795
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:20,357
- I don't know, but..
- Take care, captain.

796
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:23,160
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.

797
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:31,373
I'm not crazy, Shaw.

798
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:37,142
Major.

799
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:43,227
- Ben. Are you hungry?
- Starving.

800
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:50,301
Well, it depends on the demographic.

801
00:55:50,537 --> 00:55:51,835
Excuse me.

802
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:55,276
- I killed Baker?
- Well, it's a dream.

803
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:57,606
I mean, it could mean
something else.

804
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,413
It could mean I'm supposed
to think you did.

805
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:04,487
No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so..

806
00:56:04,857 --> 00:56:06,518
..it was okay.

807
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,195
And anyway, I remember what we did
in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

808
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,626
I just..

809
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:14,568
..don't remember actually doing it.

810
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,999
Maybe you didn't do it.

811
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:25,505
No.

812
00:56:26,485 --> 00:56:28,078
What a thought.

813
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:47,645
What?

814
00:56:52,453 --> 00:56:54,512
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

815
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:57,150
Which part?

816
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,828
I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.

817
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:06,238
This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.

818
00:57:07,773 --> 00:57:11,574
I mean, posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet,

819
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:14,441
shaking hands with total strangers
who must be completely blind

820
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:17,049
if they can't see
what I am at the core.

821
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:20,189
What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.

822
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:22,654
Ferociously a Prentiss.

823
00:57:23,227 --> 00:57:24,996
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

824
00:57:25,096 --> 00:57:26,555
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

825
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:28,657
No, you don't.

826
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:30,829
You can't.

827
00:57:33,306 --> 00:57:35,275
I was 20 years old
before I had a friend.

828
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:41,474
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,
from my point of view, anyway.

829
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:45,755
A friend outside of my mother's circle
of approved encounters

830
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:48,084
and she..

831
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:52,159
..my mother..

832
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:59,696
God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.

833
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:02,870
Precipitating my sole act
of rebellion:

834
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,911
Storming off..

835
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,208
..and enlisting in the Army.

836
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:13,057
But after the war..

837
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,257
..I came back to her.

838
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,130
Why did you come back?
What happened?

839
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:27,540
Weren't you listening?

840
00:58:28,245 --> 00:58:30,215
Mother happened.

841
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,648
You know, the truth is I hate it.

842
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:36,385
I've always despised the Medal.

843
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:40,359
The cloying adulation
of the little people.

844
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,662
It's certainly..

845
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,495
..nothing for you
to be jealous of, major.

846
00:58:46,704 --> 00:58:48,069
I'm not jealous.

847
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:50,837
I don't have the dreams, Ben.

848
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:55,680
How could you not remember
saving our unit?

849
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:57,682
I do. I said I did.

850
00:58:57,884 --> 00:59:01,446
No, no, you didn't. You said
that you didn't remember doing it.

851
00:59:01,656 --> 00:59:03,989
That's what you just said
a couple minutes ago.

852
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,924
When I think about that night..

853
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:12,196
..it's as if I know what will happen.

854
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:15,134
The thing is, I never seem
to get to the point

855
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:18,573
where I feel that it actually
does happen.

856
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:20,610
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

857
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:24,511
Okay. Well, have you discussed this
with anyone? These discrepancies?

858
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:27,082
Who would I share that with?

859
00:59:27,824 --> 00:59:30,190
My old Army buddies
who love and adore me

860
00:59:30,394 --> 00:59:32,523
for saving their
pathetically unimportant,

861
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:35,199
present company excluded, asses?

862
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:37,728
You could discuss it
with Army intelligence.

863
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:41,339
You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you

864
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,738
and discuss it and you can tell them
what you remember,

865
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:46,915
what you don't remember,
and they could..

866
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,413
..run some tests.

867
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:54,558
Yeah, tests. Boy.

868
00:59:54,794 --> 00:59:56,785
The press would have
a field day with that.

869
00:59:57,463 --> 01:00:00,160
Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.

870
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,598
I've got the hole in my back
if you wanna take a look at it.

871
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:05,364
And I got a good feeling
they put one in you too.

872
01:00:11,415 --> 01:00:13,076
Nobody has put anything
in me, Ben.

873
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:15,412
Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know..

874
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,213
- We'll go get an x-ray..
- Look, Ben,

875
01:00:17,423 --> 01:00:19,220
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

876
01:00:19,425 --> 01:00:22,020
But don't you think this could wait
till after the election?

877
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:23,390
Why? For what?

878
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:25,657
- What are you scared of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

879
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:28,632
- Then why don't we just prove it..
- Know what? I think you should leave.

880
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,399
- I'm sorry, I really..
- Listen.

881
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:36,411
Somebody got into our heads
with big steel-toe boots,

882
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:39,084
cable cutters and a chainsaw
and they went to town.

883
01:00:39,285 --> 01:00:42,744
Neurons got.. Got..
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

884
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:45,688
Our brain cells got
obliterated, Raymond.

885
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:47,452
Please.

886
01:00:48,363 --> 01:00:50,333
You need to get help, Ben.

887
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:53,366
What are you doing? Ben!

888
01:00:57,609 --> 01:00:59,305
Stop! Stop!

889
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:00,806
Inside! Inside!

890
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:07,811
Congressman!

891
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,495
He bit him. He bit him.

892
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,633
Get him out of here.

893
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,943
Are you okay, sir?

894
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:34,991
- Leave me alone.
- Sir, we should..

895
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:36,751
Get out!

896
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,769
We fished him out of
the Potomac River

897
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,878
about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

898
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:19,849
What were you doing
in Al Melvin's apartment?

899
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,544
I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.

900
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:25,748
Talk about what? Dreams?

901
01:02:28,696 --> 01:02:30,187
Interesting stuff.

902
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,426
Yeah, there's hundreds
of those in his place.

903
01:02:33,637 --> 01:02:34,899
You should have your people
check it out.

904
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:36,573
Oh, we'll get on that right away.

905
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:40,108
Colonel Garret was kind enough
to show us the file on you, Marco.

906
01:02:40,312 --> 01:02:43,612
You are the real deal, aren't you?

907
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:47,911
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

908
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:51,688
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

909
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:55,763
to ask him some
unanswered questions about..

910
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:58,628
..our reconnaissance
in Kuwait back in '91.

911
01:02:58,836 --> 01:03:00,701
- He wasn't home.
- Right. He wasn't there.

912
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:04,433
So, what, you thought it was okay
to just break in and wait for him?

913
01:03:04,643 --> 01:03:06,111
I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're headed.

914
01:03:06,313 --> 01:03:07,974
Nobody said you did.

915
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:09,671
Maybe he committed suicide.

916
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:13,550
What's your obsession
with Raymond Shaw?

917
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:15,314
I'm not obsessed
with Raymond Shaw.

918
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,186
The man of his dreams.

919
01:03:18,729 --> 01:03:20,526
You may want to ask
your medical examiners

920
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:22,597
to check Melvin's back.

921
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:24,463
It's under the skin
just shy of the scapula.

922
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,504
They may find an implant.

923
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,369
Just under the skin, left side.

924
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:31,807
If they don't look real hard,
they won't find it.

925
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:34,680
They could sing that while
they're looking for it if they like.

926
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:36,748
- Implants.
- That's what I said.

927
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:38,615
I-M-plant.

928
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:43,523
Yeah, but judging from
your file here, apparently,

929
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:46,163
you don't know your shit
from your oatmeal, my friend.

930
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,993
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

931
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,203
You got a problem?

932
01:03:51,306 --> 01:03:54,572
Psycho? You look a little angry.

933
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:58,542
Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.

934
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:02,413
- Hey!
- For God's sake, Ben..

935
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:05,113
He hit me.

936
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,121
And you wanna help him?

937
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:11,958
No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.

938
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:14,434
I want you to help him.

939
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,304
I can't even imagine why.

940
01:04:21,044 --> 01:04:24,208
Mother, I can assure you, I am as
uncomfortable asking you to do this

941
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:26,578
as you are being asked.

942
01:04:26,919 --> 01:04:29,514
My campaign people are getting
a restraining order against him.

943
01:04:29,723 --> 01:04:32,955
He's going on every security watch list,
but I won't lock him up.

944
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,824
- I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

945
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:38,192
I don't know, it's just..

946
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:43,205
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

947
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:45,204
Can we get back to the campaign
and focus on something..

948
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,812
Raymond, you don't actually
believe his story?

949
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:52,515
No.

950
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:55,113
But he does.

951
01:04:56,691 --> 01:04:59,126
And he's a fine soldier.

952
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,893
And if his slim hold
on sanity requires

953
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,569
that I tolerate his delusions
until he can get help, I'll do it.

954
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,397
It doesn't diminish me.

955
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:09,940
I'm not afraid of him.

956
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,567
Raymond.

957
01:05:20,256 --> 01:05:23,852
How much do you actually know
about your friend?

958
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,270
Oh, that's sad.

959
01:05:57,472 --> 01:05:59,372
Poor little tin soldier.

960
01:05:59,574 --> 01:06:01,269
Mother, please.

961
01:06:01,476 --> 01:06:04,072
Well, just imagine how terrified
your people were yesterday

962
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,614
when Major Marco showed up
at campaign headquarters

963
01:06:06,817 --> 01:06:08,409
and you invite..

964
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:10,712
My God, you invited him in.

965
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:12,824
With all they know about him.

966
01:06:13,826 --> 01:06:15,760
I know him.

967
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,331
I served under him.
He was a good man.

968
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:21,730
Well, that's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

969
01:06:30,682 --> 01:06:33,516
You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.

970
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:37,502
Someone from
Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called

971
01:06:37,709 --> 01:06:39,871
and intervened on your behalf.

972
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,640
Major, you've reached the terminal end
of the Army's patience.

973
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,479
You're relieved of duty,
effective immediately.

974
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:49,487
Yes, sir.

975
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:51,024
Ben,

976
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:54,460
there is a young neurologist
at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.

977
01:06:54,665 --> 01:06:56,929
He's had real success
with Gulf War Syndrome.

978
01:06:57,135 --> 01:06:59,071
You are instructed to get
your affairs in order

979
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:01,331
and report to him
first thing Monday morning.

980
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,306
I thought you said you lost it.

981
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,070
I bit a guy. I found another one.

982
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:36,718
These are not supposed to exist.

983
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:46,422
These are only theoretical.

984
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,065
So, what does it do?

985
01:07:53,276 --> 01:07:55,608
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

986
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:59,479
I don't know.

987
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,847
I don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.

988
01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:07,789
Look, it's out of you
and you are still alive.

989
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:10,123
That's the good news.

990
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:12,157
What's the bad news?

991
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:16,598
Maybe they know you're here.

992
01:08:35,431 --> 01:08:38,560
You said the Army implants,
they were for

993
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:41,170
emergency medical data, right?

994
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:44,070
The ones they publicized were.

995
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:50,079
There was a parallel project
for all kinds of scary implantables.

996
01:08:50,285 --> 01:08:53,813
The Clinton watchdogs finally
freaked out about it, closed down.

997
01:08:54,023 --> 01:08:56,116
Parallel project?

998
01:08:56,325 --> 01:08:57,554
How did you know about that?

999
01:08:57,761 --> 01:09:02,563
Manchurian Global funded me
to make some of their scary shit.

1000
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,498
Heard of them?

1001
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,567
Imagine not just
a corporation, Marco,

1002
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:11,405
but a goddamn geopolitical
extension of policy

1003
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:13,843
for every president since Nixon.

1004
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,779
Cash is king, Marco.

1005
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,045
Cash is king.

1006
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:31,664
You sure you wanna do this?

1007
01:09:31,872 --> 01:09:33,602
Absolutely.

1008
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:37,574
Because I don't.

1009
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,111
I'll owe you one.

1010
01:09:39,315 --> 01:09:41,045
No.

1011
01:09:41,252 --> 01:09:43,050
I still owe you.

1012
01:09:44,155 --> 01:09:46,454
For getting me out of Albania.

1013
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:47,956
Albania.

1014
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:54,635
What are you doing?

1015
01:09:54,836 --> 01:09:56,600
In case I forget things
I wanna remember.

1016
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:06,674
I'm putting you on a cocktail
of methohexitol to take the edge off.

1017
01:10:06,885 --> 01:10:08,353
The edge off of what?

1018
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:12,286
Getting clarity.
Or whatever you wanna call it.

1019
01:10:13,028 --> 01:10:17,294
ECT not being
the precise science that, say,

1020
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,469
leeching is.

1021
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,968
You don't think
this is gonna work?

1022
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,370
It's a desperation move, man.

1023
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:28,309
But, hey, there is a school
of thought that says

1024
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:30,847
a victim of induced abreaction..

1025
01:10:31,051 --> 01:10:33,019
Here it comes.

1026
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:06,586
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

1027
01:11:06,798 --> 01:11:07,992
The patrol is ambushed.

1028
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,637
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

1029
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:13,773
assessing troop strength..

1030
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:15,839
Captain Marco was
knocked unconscious.

1031
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:18,979
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

1032
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,375
Baker goes after him.

1033
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:21,777
Hello, captain.

1034
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:25,083
Before Sergeant Shaw
is able to locate..

1035
01:11:25,288 --> 01:11:27,416
Eddie Ingram gets himself
separated to the left.

1036
01:12:07,344 --> 01:12:09,540
Did you go blank on me again?

1037
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,314
He said this would happen.

1038
01:12:18,726 --> 01:12:20,318
Who?

1039
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:23,794
Your German friend.
Your friend.

1040
01:12:25,335 --> 01:12:26,825
Ben.

1041
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:33,174
He said it'd be like
a computer system crash.

1042
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:36,371
That your brain would shut down,
but it would reboot again

1043
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,813
and you'd forget all your RAM.

1044
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:41,011
Or most of your RAM.

1045
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,992
Do you remember me?

1046
01:12:52,337 --> 01:12:55,899
Do you remember me?

1047
01:12:56,977 --> 01:12:58,638
Ben?

1048
01:13:00,281 --> 01:13:02,249
Eugenie.

1049
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,855
How did I get here?

1050
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,321
You called me.

1051
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,788
Where am I?

1052
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,627
Planning a suicide bombing.

1053
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:18,828
The Mile High City has suffered
a series of brutal attacks

1054
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,507
during the past several months.

1055
01:13:20,808 --> 01:13:24,869
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,
does it bother you at all

1056
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,074
that your son repudiates
so many of your more

1057
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:32,017
- controversial policies?
- No. He's his own person.

1058
01:13:32,223 --> 01:13:34,692
Raymond and I may disagree
on certain issues,

1059
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:38,057
but I think we share
the same fundamental vision

1060
01:13:38,264 --> 01:13:39,698
of what this country can be.

1061
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,663
- Which is?
- Better.

1062
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:43,428
Better and better.

1063
01:13:43,637 --> 01:13:45,766
Safer, braver, stronger.

1064
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:49,070
A beacon of freedom
in a world troubled by shadows.

1065
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:51,144
America must prevail.

1066
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:54,750
The future and survival
of modern civilization,

1067
01:13:54,953 --> 01:13:57,616
democracy, freedom,
all depend upon it.

1068
01:13:57,823 --> 01:13:59,882
So your son, Congressman Shaw..

1069
01:14:00,594 --> 01:14:02,460
Rosie.

1070
01:14:09,471 --> 01:14:12,169
I was in the park on Friday?

1071
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,172
We were in the park on Monday.

1072
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:18,013
Monday?

1073
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,616
- Yep.
- Monday.

1074
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:27,323
We were flying low.
It's, like, over the ocean, and just..

1075
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,954
A field hospital.

1076
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,432
And they took us up to this place.

1077
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:36,004
- Where? Military?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1078
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:37,766
Just state-of-the-art stuff everywhere.

1079
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:42,311
Stainless steel and wires
and tubes and monitors.

1080
01:14:48,157 --> 01:14:50,421
- Were you tortured?
- No. Yeah.

1081
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:53,721
I mean, there was pain.
You know, it was like..

1082
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,631
I don't know what they call it.

1083
01:14:59,605 --> 01:15:01,266
Invasive procedure.

1084
01:15:01,473 --> 01:15:02,964
For example?

1085
01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:05,509
Like what? What do you mean?

1086
01:15:19,832 --> 01:15:21,766
Invasive.

1087
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:24,094
See, they were in my head..

1088
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:27,031
..and they made me..

1089
01:15:29,812 --> 01:15:32,714
Well, Raymond Shaw,
they made him kill somebody.

1090
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,383
Like it was nothing.

1091
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:37,019
Private Robert Baker.

1092
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:38,621
That's who it was, it was a private.

1093
01:15:38,824 --> 01:15:41,258
One of my soldiers.

1094
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:44,728
I think they made me
kill somebody too.

1095
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,826
A kid named Eddie Ingram.

1096
01:15:49,037 --> 01:15:51,802
Private Ingram, stand up.

1097
01:15:52,007 --> 01:15:55,136
Walk a few steps, please.

1098
01:15:56,646 --> 01:15:59,980
And if you could secure the door,
please, Chris.

1099
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:02,511
Captain Marco.

1100
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:04,451
Stand up.

1101
01:16:05,992 --> 01:16:07,460
- Raymond.
- Yes, sir.

1102
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:09,891
There's a gun on the cupboard.

1103
01:16:10,097 --> 01:16:13,261
Would you please take it
and give it to Captain Marco.

1104
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:14,959
Yes, sir.

1105
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,502
Here.

1106
01:16:18,376 --> 01:16:19,342
Captain.

1107
01:16:23,115 --> 01:16:24,777
Captain Marco,

1108
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:27,749
please shoot Private Ingram.

1109
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,838
Now, Raymond,

1110
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,405
suffocate Private Baker.

1111
01:16:43,608 --> 01:16:44,632
Kill him.

1112
01:17:01,632 --> 01:17:03,464
Keep going, Raymond.

1113
01:17:21,325 --> 01:17:24,193
I knew the..
A soldier knows the enemy.

1114
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:26,057
I'm in command.

1115
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,700
That's primary, I know.

1116
01:17:29,336 --> 01:17:31,167
I thought I knew..

1117
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,107
..who the enemy was.

1118
01:17:34,308 --> 01:17:38,508
My men, they trusted me
with their lives, you know?

1119
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:40,273
Don't.

1120
01:17:40,483 --> 01:17:42,042
Don't touch me.

1121
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:49,425
Ben, the person that did this,
what was his name?

1122
01:17:49,629 --> 01:17:51,564
Can you remember?

1123
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:55,060
Did he have a name?

1124
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:01,038
Ben?

1125
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:01,611
Smile if you like.

1126
01:21:04,586 --> 01:21:06,145
This will just take a minute.

1127
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,399
I see you there all the time.

1128
01:21:16,601 --> 01:21:18,867
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

1129
01:21:19,072 --> 01:21:22,668
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

1130
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:26,674
Old friend up there,
an old Army friend that..

1131
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,612
Well, he's in politics now..

1132
01:21:32,323 --> 01:21:33,790
What else did we talk about?

1133
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:36,152
What happened to you
after you were captured?

1134
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:38,520
Black helicopters,
secret laboratories..

1135
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:44,361
..mad scientist, mind drugs..

1136
01:21:44,973 --> 01:21:47,738
..shock torture
and Raymond Shaw.

1137
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:50,003
- You don't believe any of it, do you?
- It's crazy.

1138
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:52,010
- It sounds crazy, doesn't it?
- It sounds crazy.

1139
01:21:52,216 --> 01:21:54,185
That's what they wanted
me to think too.

1140
01:21:54,385 --> 01:21:56,250
It's exactly what they want
you to think.

1141
01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:01,053
What about the other guys
from your unit?

1142
01:22:02,195 --> 01:22:03,458
Where are they?

1143
01:22:03,664 --> 01:22:07,897
They're all gone.
So-called natural causes.

1144
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:10,800
Owens died of cancer in '97.

1145
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:14,534
Villalobos' car crashed.

1146
01:22:14,745 --> 01:22:16,179
Atkins committed suicide.

1147
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:19,408
Jameson died 9/11, Pentagon.

1148
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:23,155
- Ben?
- Yeah?

1149
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:25,484
- Did he have a name?
- Who?

1150
01:22:25,693 --> 01:22:28,321
The person that did this, Ben.

1151
01:22:28,529 --> 01:22:31,363
What was his name?
Can you remember?

1152
01:22:33,003 --> 01:22:34,265
Ben.

1153
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:36,269
- Yeah?
- Did he have a name?

1154
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:41,151
You only have to look
at the enormous strides made

1155
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,522
in the last decade
with the genetic reconfiguration

1156
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:45,823
of the noble tomato.

1157
01:23:46,032 --> 01:23:48,831
What was happening was the tomato
was over-ripening in the process

1158
01:23:49,036 --> 01:23:50,834
and it was losing its flavor.

1159
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:54,602
It's actually a very simple procedure
to deactivate the gene concerned.

1160
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:58,178
And the same thing
can be applied to ourselves.

1161
01:23:58,382 --> 01:23:59,407
At a flick of a switch,

1162
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:02,484
we can adjust character,

1163
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,384
change personality.

1164
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:07,116
And of course, more importantly..

1165
01:24:07,994 --> 01:24:11,089
..we can offset
the ravages of dementia

1166
01:24:11,298 --> 01:24:16,260
by implanting memory or adjusting
the synaptic connections.

1167
01:24:16,472 --> 01:24:19,909
We can free people
from the terrible burden

1168
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:22,443
of an emotionally
compromised past.

1169
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,119
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

1170
01:24:28,321 --> 01:24:29,413
Watch where you're going!

1171
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:31,558
Just back up! Just back up.

1172
01:24:31,759 --> 01:24:34,991
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

1173
01:24:36,832 --> 01:24:38,630
Take it easy, sir.

1174
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:46,404
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

1175
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:50,515
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

1176
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,115
I guess there's been some trouble
with this guy

1177
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:56,120
involving Congressman Shaw.

1178
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:58,692
Oh?

1179
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:05,228
Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

1180
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:07,564
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

1181
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:11,108
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

1182
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:13,803
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

1183
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:17,611
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

1184
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,913
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

1185
01:25:20,122 --> 01:25:21,556
They're.. They're..
They're gigantic.

1186
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:23,624
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

1187
01:25:24,462 --> 01:25:25,929
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

1188
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:28,031
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

1189
01:25:28,234 --> 01:25:29,724
that's a giant leap forward.

1190
01:25:30,203 --> 01:25:33,230
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

1191
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:34,601
A, your spotty memory,

1192
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,505
B, the Internet,

1193
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:40,149
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

1194
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:42,819
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

1195
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,885
along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

1196
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:47,217
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

1197
01:25:47,426 --> 01:25:51,522
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

1198
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,427
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

1199
01:25:53,634 --> 01:25:55,192
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

1200
01:25:55,403 --> 01:25:56,495
Shocked to learn

1201
01:25:56,704 --> 01:25:59,230
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

1202
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:01,432
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

1203
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:03,203
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1204
01:26:03,781 --> 01:26:05,772
That is not why I'm here.

1205
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,981
I looked you up too, senator.

1206
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,789
Oh?

1207
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:18,628
You were in the Army.

1208
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:20,028
I was drafted.

1209
01:26:20,236 --> 01:26:22,967
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

1210
01:26:23,173 --> 01:26:25,938
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

1211
01:26:26,144 --> 01:26:28,909
And you know how it works.

1212
01:26:29,315 --> 01:26:31,647
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

1213
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,149
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

1214
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:36,949
And I'd be lying to you if I said

1215
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,127
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

1216
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:42,127
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

1217
01:26:42,332 --> 01:26:45,097
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

1218
01:26:45,302 --> 01:26:47,202
I'd be lying to you.

1219
01:26:49,174 --> 01:26:51,075
You're right, major.

1220
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:53,178
I do.

1221
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:58,043
A $5,000-a-plate dinner honoring
the CEO of Votron Incorporated,

1222
01:26:58,252 --> 01:27:01,620
the nation's third-largest producer of
the controversial touch-screen units

1223
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:04,794
that will be used in the forthcoming
election, was disrupted last night,

1224
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:07,658
when protestors disguised as
waiters and kitchen staff

1225
01:27:07,865 --> 01:27:10,733
unleashed a blizzard
of symbolic chants from above,

1226
01:27:10,936 --> 01:27:12,301
resulting in a momentary panic.

1227
01:27:12,504 --> 01:27:15,804
The supporters of presidential hopeful
Vice President Edward Nelson

1228
01:27:16,009 --> 01:27:18,001
fled to exits and dove under tables.

1229
01:27:18,213 --> 01:27:22,309
Security personnel quickly subdued
the protestors, one of whom..

1230
01:27:23,486 --> 01:27:25,249
The man is insane, Tom.

1231
01:27:25,454 --> 01:27:27,218
Full-blown schizophrenia.

1232
01:27:27,424 --> 01:27:30,724
He's been stalking Raymond,
the FBI is all over this already.

1233
01:27:30,929 --> 01:27:32,954
I've seen the files.

1234
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,067
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?

1235
01:27:37,371 --> 01:27:40,466
Your bipolar war buddy
has been sharing his dreams

1236
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:42,337
with Senator Jordan.

1237
01:27:42,944 --> 01:27:44,037
Hello, Raymond.

1238
01:27:44,746 --> 01:27:47,148
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?

1239
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:50,480
Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

1240
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:52,480
Raymond.

1241
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:58,120
Do you recognize this man?

1242
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:01,566
No.

1243
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:03,862
His name is Atticus Noyle.

1244
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:06,773
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

1245
01:28:06,976 --> 01:28:09,537
Someone our CIA turned to

1246
01:28:09,747 --> 01:28:12,945
for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

1247
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:16,246
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

1248
01:28:16,456 --> 01:28:19,221
to terrorists and rogue states.

1249
01:28:19,693 --> 01:28:21,719
And what does he
have to do with me?

1250
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:26,598
Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man..

1251
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:28,131
..brainwashed you.

1252
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:29,896
In his dreams.

1253
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,803
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

1254
01:28:33,311 --> 01:28:36,839
And has you poised to be the first
privately owned and operated

1255
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:38,711
vice president of the United States.

1256
01:28:38,918 --> 01:28:41,319
Sir, I've already spoken
with Ben Marco.

1257
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:44,117
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

1258
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:45,658
He's delusional.

1259
01:28:45,861 --> 01:28:47,489
Nevertheless,

1260
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,097
he's pulled from his mad hat

1261
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,461
some remarkably lucid connections

1262
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:55,367
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

1263
01:28:55,573 --> 01:28:57,303
and this Dr. Noyle

1264
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,775
and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

1265
01:29:00,313 --> 01:29:03,579
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 15 years.

1266
01:29:03,785 --> 01:29:06,482
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.

1267
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:08,350
Both sides of the aisle.

1268
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:09,752
What are you saying?

1269
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:14,421
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

1270
01:29:14,633 --> 01:29:17,262
was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global,

1271
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,132
developing deep implant
behavior modification.

1272
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:22,069
Oh, my God.

1273
01:29:22,276 --> 01:29:24,336
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.

1274
01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:25,535
- You.
- Tom.

1275
01:29:25,747 --> 01:29:27,147
Connect the dots, Raymond.

1276
01:29:27,349 --> 01:29:30,410
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol

1277
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,111
for those three missing days?

1278
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:36,783
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

1279
01:29:36,995 --> 01:29:40,124
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

1280
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,665
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

1281
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,931
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

1282
01:29:47,142 --> 01:29:48,666
Bow out gracefully.

1283
01:29:48,877 --> 01:29:50,470
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

1284
01:29:50,947 --> 01:29:53,075
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

1285
01:29:53,283 --> 01:29:55,080
Oh, that's what this is about.

1286
01:29:55,285 --> 01:29:57,550
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

1287
01:29:57,755 --> 01:29:59,451
Help them trace this thing
to its source

1288
01:29:59,658 --> 01:30:02,492
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

1289
01:30:02,696 --> 01:30:05,427
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

1290
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:06,861
first thing in the morning.

1291
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,696
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

1292
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,965
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

1293
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:14,405
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

1294
01:30:14,612 --> 01:30:15,840
I will find out about it.

1295
01:30:16,046 --> 01:30:17,776
You have 12 hours, senator.

1296
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:20,451
But if it's not true,

1297
01:30:20,652 --> 01:30:23,019
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

1298
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:25,418
and bury you.

1299
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:30,019
Good night.

1300
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,731
It's preposterous.

1301
01:30:36,606 --> 01:30:38,803
Idiotic story.

1302
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,007
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.

1303
01:30:42,215 --> 01:30:43,239
What?

1304
01:30:44,617 --> 01:30:47,382
I've been having the dreams.

1305
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:50,981
Ben said there were tests
they could run to see if..

1306
01:30:51,193 --> 01:30:53,627
No. Where are you going?

1307
01:30:54,196 --> 01:30:55,527
Sergeant Shaw.

1308
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:57,222
What?

1309
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:01,103
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

1310
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,702
Mother, I..

1311
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:07,142
Raymond Prentiss Shaw.

1312
01:31:07,882 --> 01:31:09,440
Yes.

1313
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:13,247
Listen.

1314
01:32:02,955 --> 01:32:04,217
Good morning to you all,

1315
01:32:04,423 --> 01:32:06,618
and welcome to Amtrak's
northbound Acela,

1316
01:32:06,825 --> 01:32:10,284
making station stops
at Baltimore, Philadelphia,

1317
01:32:10,497 --> 01:32:13,023
Newark, New York's Penn Station

1318
01:32:13,234 --> 01:32:15,670
and Boston as the last stop..

1319
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,748
Who's that?

1320
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:34,121
It's Raymond, sir.

1321
01:32:35,663 --> 01:32:36,722
Oh, don't do that.

1322
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:39,025
You're gonna get
soaking wet, Raymond.

1323
01:32:41,072 --> 01:32:42,596
Raymond.

1324
01:32:44,342 --> 01:32:46,469
I came to apologize, sir.

1325
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,812
Raymond, what are you doing?

1326
01:32:50,016 --> 01:32:52,485
- I'm sorry.
- We'll get some help for you, son.

1327
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,822
It's not your fault, Raymond.
It's not your fault.

1328
01:32:56,257 --> 01:32:58,055
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's your mother..

1329
01:33:26,097 --> 01:33:27,462
Dad!

1330
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,158
Help!

1331
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:39,981
Oh, God. Daddy!

1332
01:33:41,618 --> 01:33:43,143
Help!

1333
01:33:55,335 --> 01:33:57,600
Raymond? What are you doing?!

1334
01:33:57,805 --> 01:34:02,176
What is going on?
What is happening?

1335
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,647
Where's my father?

1336
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,338
What are you doing?

1337
01:34:07,084 --> 01:34:09,952
Dad! Dad!

1338
01:34:51,576 --> 01:34:52,942
The five-term senator

1339
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:56,445
and recent front-runner for his party's
vice presidential nomination

1340
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,743
appears to have
accidentally drowned

1341
01:34:58,952 --> 01:35:02,981
when his kayak overturned near
his Chesapeake Bay weekend home.

1342
01:35:03,259 --> 01:35:06,024
Police say his daughter,
35-year-old Jocelyn,

1343
01:35:06,229 --> 01:35:07,924
may have been trying
to rescue Jordan

1344
01:35:08,131 --> 01:35:11,796
when she was herself overcome
by the icy water.

1345
01:35:12,037 --> 01:35:14,232
The bodies of Senator Jordan
and his daughter

1346
01:35:14,439 --> 01:35:16,841
were discovered this morning
by a crab fisherman

1347
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:20,242
who spotted the capsized kayak
floating far offshore,

1348
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:23,145
nearly a mile from
Senator Jordan's residence.

1349
01:35:23,352 --> 01:35:27,015
Neighbors say the senator was an
expert kayaker whose morning trips

1350
01:35:27,223 --> 01:35:30,682
were a familiar sight along
the western bank of the Bay.

1351
01:35:30,895 --> 01:35:34,024
Governor Arthur, do you have
any comment on this tragic event?

1352
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,697
Senator Jordan was a statesman
of the highest integrity.

1353
01:35:39,273 --> 01:35:41,264
Tom Jordan was a friend.

1354
01:35:41,676 --> 01:35:43,611
A damn fine man.

1355
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:46,307
Just a great American.

1356
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:49,542
That's all for now. We'll have
something for you a little later.

1357
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:52,348
They're the latest target of SEC
corruption probes,

1358
01:35:52,557 --> 01:35:55,618
but private equity fund
Manchurian Global confirmed today

1359
01:35:55,828 --> 01:35:59,389
it is continuing with plans to
finance privately owned combat units

1360
01:35:59,599 --> 01:36:02,160
to relieve beleaguered
U.S. Troop deployments worldwide.

1361
01:36:02,403 --> 01:36:06,465
It is a move that could save the
Defense Department billions of dollars.

1362
01:36:08,411 --> 01:36:09,639
How does Arthur die?

1363
01:36:10,013 --> 01:36:11,914
You know who I'm talking about,
the new president.

1364
01:36:12,116 --> 01:36:14,449
If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes
the new president, doesn't he?

1365
01:36:14,653 --> 01:36:16,450
Chain of succession.
That's what you got in mind.

1366
01:36:16,655 --> 01:36:17,816
That's what you people wanna do.

1367
01:36:18,024 --> 01:36:20,083
You wanna really run the world,
don't you, Susie? Rosie?

1368
01:36:20,294 --> 01:36:23,092
Whatever the hell your name is. I got
my library card and I got your tapes.

1369
01:36:23,298 --> 01:36:25,096
I do my research too.
We're going to the feds,

1370
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,203
we're going to the police,
the newspapers, whatever it takes.

1371
01:36:28,938 --> 01:36:30,839
I am the feds.

1372
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,010
Now, get off me!

1373
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:38,772
Get off of me!

1374
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:52,732
We found..

1375
01:36:53,505 --> 01:36:55,700
..an implant device..

1376
01:36:56,641 --> 01:36:58,303
..in Al Melvin.

1377
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:01,211
You found one in Melvin.

1378
01:37:01,414 --> 01:37:03,316
Just like you said.

1379
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:10,122
I'm part of a shadow unit.
We've been watching you.

1380
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:13,925
Trying to sort this thing out.

1381
01:37:15,032 --> 01:37:16,728
This isn't an election, this is a coup.

1382
01:37:16,934 --> 01:37:20,736
This is.. In our own country,
a regime change, in our own country.

1383
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:23,205
Ben, don't. Ben.

1384
01:37:23,409 --> 01:37:27,848
This is rich people, Manchurian Global
funding bad science

1385
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:32,784
to put a sleeper in the White House,
and that's what's going on, Rosie.

1386
01:37:33,023 --> 01:37:35,288
- That's what's going on.
- I wanna believe you.

1387
01:37:35,493 --> 01:37:38,361
Well, then, believe me.
Help me. Help me.

1388
01:37:38,564 --> 01:37:40,225
Shoot me, then.
Help me or shoot me.

1389
01:37:40,432 --> 01:37:41,900
Make a decision.

1390
01:37:42,101 --> 01:37:44,262
Make a decision.

1391
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:55,579
I made a decision
when I met you, Ben.

1392
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:04,128
Now, why don't you show me
what you have in your file.

1393
01:38:05,132 --> 01:38:06,963
- Sir!
- Congressman!

1394
01:38:10,105 --> 01:38:12,596
Sir, do you have a statement
for us tonight?

1395
01:38:14,277 --> 01:38:16,610
Was exceptionally clear
and simple.

1396
01:38:16,814 --> 01:38:19,443
A stronger, safer,
more profitable world

1397
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:22,484
through uncorruptible
top-level management.

1398
01:38:22,755 --> 01:38:24,417
We trust you with our technology

1399
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,388
and suddenly you turn him
into a common hit man.

1400
01:38:26,593 --> 01:38:29,392
How fucking dare you.
I trusted you with my son.

1401
01:38:29,597 --> 01:38:30,656
You didn't even ask us..

1402
01:38:30,866 --> 01:38:33,494
Don't lecture me! You swore to me
that this was fail-safe.

1403
01:38:33,703 --> 01:38:35,967
No leaks, no glitches, no..
No dreams.

1404
01:38:36,172 --> 01:38:37,867
Not even a shadow of what was done
to Raymond..

1405
01:38:38,074 --> 01:38:40,135
You needed to ask before you acted.
This is not a..

1406
01:38:40,345 --> 01:38:42,973
Tom Jordan was going to destroy
my son and everything I've worked for,

1407
01:38:43,182 --> 01:38:45,446
and every one of us along with it.
And you wanted me to what?

1408
01:38:45,652 --> 01:38:47,916
- Call a meeting?
- Now, look, look, look.

1409
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:52,020
In the larger course of history..

1410
01:38:52,762 --> 01:38:54,251
..there are key players..

1411
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,858
..and role players, senator.

1412
01:38:57,067 --> 01:39:01,027
Bullshit! This is about my son
and the future of this country.

1413
01:39:02,206 --> 01:39:04,732
I thought we understood each other.

1414
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:07,470
I think we do. I think we really do.

1415
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:10,276
- Your god is money.
- Oh, wait, wait, and yours is..?

1416
01:39:10,484 --> 01:39:11,918
No, no. I'm a believer.

1417
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,054
I am an optimist.
I believe in the future.

1418
01:39:14,256 --> 01:39:15,849
And people who do,
the ones who make history

1419
01:39:16,059 --> 01:39:17,686
instead of just sitting around
watching it,

1420
01:39:17,894 --> 01:39:20,193
no, they're willing to take
the big risks.

1421
01:39:20,397 --> 01:39:22,093
Yes, I made a decision.

1422
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:25,603
Oh, God! Where are
all the men anymore?

1423
01:39:25,871 --> 01:39:27,965
My father, Tyler Prentiss,
never asked,

1424
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:30,609
"Is this okay? Is this okay?"

1425
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:32,780
You know what I'm saying, Mark?

1426
01:39:32,981 --> 01:39:35,850
He just did what needed to be done.

1427
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:39,488
Come on, rise and shine, New York.
It's a big day in the Big Apple.

1428
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:43,126
That's right. All polls indicate
that New Yorkers will be turning out

1429
01:39:43,327 --> 01:39:45,456
in record numbers today
across the five boroughs

1430
01:39:45,664 --> 01:39:47,223
to select a new president.

1431
01:39:47,433 --> 01:39:49,901
At least, that's how the billboard
says it's supposed to happen.

1432
01:39:50,104 --> 01:39:51,629
The polls open at 6 a.m.

1433
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,242
And bars and taverns in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx,

1434
01:39:55,443 --> 01:39:58,414
and Staten Island will be
opening shortly thereafter.

1435
01:39:58,614 --> 01:40:02,483
That's right, New Yorkers. We are
free to drink and vote all day today.

1436
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:22,672
Thank you. Thank you.

1437
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,745
Thanks for coming out.

1438
01:40:27,886 --> 01:40:29,856
Congressman, good luck.

1439
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:33,359
- Hello.
- Hi.

1440
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:37,963
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- The next vice president, sir.

1441
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:39,499
I hope so.

1442
01:40:39,736 --> 01:40:42,570
- Let's have a win.
- We're with you. We're with you.

1443
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,805
Thank you, Tony, take care.

1444
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,548
Thank you.

1445
01:41:13,213 --> 01:41:16,184
Take care. Goodbye.
Thanks very much.

1446
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:35,465
It's clean.

1447
01:41:39,748 --> 01:41:40,840
It's clean.

1448
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:43,677
It's all right, Evan.

1449
01:41:51,697 --> 01:41:52,891
How's your back?

1450
01:41:56,336 --> 01:41:58,668
I've been having the dreams, Ben.

1451
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:01,271
Oh, that's good.

1452
01:42:02,211 --> 01:42:03,474
They're inside my head.

1453
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,079
We'll get them out. I got the proof.

1454
01:42:05,282 --> 01:42:07,183
I know what they did to us.
I just don't know why.

1455
01:42:07,385 --> 01:42:08,613
I dream things, Ben.

1456
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:11,153
Terrible things that can't
possibly have happened.

1457
01:42:11,523 --> 01:42:13,515
- I'm gone, Ben..
- No, you're not, you're right here.

1458
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,559
Ben..

1459
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,522
..there's something I want
you to have.

1460
01:42:23,606 --> 01:42:25,471
I don't deserve this.

1461
01:42:31,149 --> 01:42:32,549
Jocelyn's dead.

1462
01:42:33,886 --> 01:42:35,080
I know.

1463
01:42:36,223 --> 01:42:37,520
And the senator.

1464
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,891
Yeah.

1465
01:42:42,664 --> 01:42:44,427
Did I..?

1466
01:42:46,704 --> 01:42:48,569
I think so, Raymond, yes.

1467
01:42:49,908 --> 01:42:54,346
I don't remember, Ben.
I don't remember.

1468
01:42:55,314 --> 01:42:56,838
Raymond..

1469
01:42:57,283 --> 01:43:00,151
..did they tell you what it is
they want you to do?

1470
01:43:00,354 --> 01:43:01,549
That's what I gotta find out.

1471
01:43:01,756 --> 01:43:05,022
We gotta find out what's gonna
happen, where it's gonna happen..

1472
01:43:05,227 --> 01:43:08,595
Are we friends, Ben?
I wanna believe we were friends.

1473
01:43:08,799 --> 01:43:13,567
We are connected and that's
something nobody can take from us.

1474
01:43:14,473 --> 01:43:16,669
You could've had me locked up,
but you didn't.

1475
01:43:16,876 --> 01:43:19,174
That's proof that there's something
deep inside.

1476
01:43:19,379 --> 01:43:21,007
There's a part that they can't get to.

1477
01:43:21,215 --> 01:43:23,741
And it's deep inside of us.
And that's where the truth is.

1478
01:43:23,952 --> 01:43:26,979
That's our only hope. That's what
you and me need to tap into,

1479
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:30,091
and that's what you and I are gonna
use to take them out, Raymond.

1480
01:43:30,294 --> 01:43:32,455
We don't have much time. Please.

1481
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,536
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- Raymond, please.

1482
01:43:38,737 --> 01:43:40,399
You don't think they saw this
coming, Ben?

1483
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:43,742
You don't think they factored you in?

1484
01:43:46,381 --> 01:43:49,715
I am the enemy, Major Marco.

1485
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,051
What are you talking about?

1486
01:43:56,963 --> 01:43:58,453
Yes, Mother.

1487
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:01,666
Yes, he's right here.

1488
01:44:03,972 --> 01:44:06,464
- She wants you.
- Me?

1489
01:44:10,648 --> 01:44:11,807
Yes, senator.

1490
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:14,985
- Is this Captain Marco?
- Yeah.

1491
01:44:15,454 --> 01:44:18,116
Captain Bennett Marco?

1492
01:44:18,858 --> 01:44:19,825
Yes.

1493
01:44:21,962 --> 01:44:24,897
Bennett Ezekiel Marco.

1494
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,659
Yes.

1495
01:44:32,075 --> 01:44:33,508
Listen.

1496
01:45:06,153 --> 01:45:07,781
Hurry up!

1497
01:45:20,673 --> 01:45:22,402
Major Marco?

1498
01:45:35,058 --> 01:45:36,583
Ben?

1499
01:45:38,262 --> 01:45:41,960
People can get together whenever
they want and not get in trouble.

1500
01:45:42,334 --> 01:45:45,429
People should be allowed to say
what is on their mind..

1501
01:45:55,819 --> 01:45:57,185
The Bill of Rights gives people..

1502
01:46:04,497 --> 01:46:05,692
Thank you.

1503
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:08,129
The candidates made ritual trips
to the voting booths today.

1504
01:46:08,336 --> 01:46:10,861
Governor Arthur,
casting his ballot in North Platte,

1505
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,803
will spend election night in the Big Apple
with running mate Raymond Shaw

1506
01:46:14,009 --> 01:46:15,875
for their anticipated victory party.

1507
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:18,708
The presidential rival,
incumbent Vice President Nelson

1508
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:21,385
returned to his home
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1509
01:46:21,586 --> 01:46:23,486
He attended special church services
this morning..

1510
01:47:15,724 --> 01:47:17,693
- All clear.
- Raymond..

1511
01:47:17,894 --> 01:47:19,418
- Clear.
- ..listen.

1512
01:47:19,629 --> 01:47:24,091
The bullet will strike Bob Arthur
the moment you step forward

1513
01:47:24,302 --> 01:47:27,101
and arrive on your star beside him.

1514
01:47:27,306 --> 01:47:30,435
Because the assassin..

1515
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:36,218
..the deranged, obsessed..

1516
01:47:36,418 --> 01:47:40,321
..tragically paranoid lone gunman..

1517
01:47:40,524 --> 01:47:43,459
..is trying to kill you.

1518
01:47:44,428 --> 01:47:46,921
Major Marco's
an excellent marksman.

1519
01:47:47,599 --> 01:47:51,127
But you must stay very, very still

1520
01:47:51,337 --> 01:47:54,774
and stand right where you're
supposed to stand.

1521
01:47:55,277 --> 01:47:57,041
What happens to Ben?

1522
01:47:58,314 --> 01:48:01,112
The assassin always dies, baby.

1523
01:48:01,585 --> 01:48:04,350
It's necessary for
the national healing.

1524
01:48:11,965 --> 01:48:16,336
I'm sure you will never entirely
comprehend this, darling.

1525
01:48:22,546 --> 01:48:25,015
But I want you to know, Raymond..

1526
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,850
..I did this for you.

1527
01:48:29,388 --> 01:48:32,085
So that you could have
what I couldn't.

1528
01:48:32,693 --> 01:48:34,992
What your father threw away.

1529
01:48:35,963 --> 01:48:39,456
The opportunity to lead this nation.

1530
01:48:40,769 --> 01:48:43,967
- I know, Mother.
- And so I let them take you

1531
01:48:44,175 --> 01:48:46,075
and change you a little bit.

1532
01:48:46,277 --> 01:48:48,337
Not so much that you would notice,

1533
01:48:48,547 --> 01:48:54,977
but just enough to bring you back
to who you really are.

1534
01:48:57,525 --> 01:49:00,495
And to what you will become.

1535
01:49:04,802 --> 01:49:06,997
Oh, and look at you.

1536
01:49:08,506 --> 01:49:10,600
Look at you.
Look what you've achieved,

1537
01:49:10,809 --> 01:49:14,303
look how far we've come.
It's working, Raymond.

1538
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:18,583
And you're going to save
our country now.

1539
01:49:19,588 --> 01:49:23,184
In the hour of her greatest need.

1540
01:49:24,994 --> 01:49:26,656
Yes, Mother.

1541
01:49:30,936 --> 01:49:32,528
But..

1542
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:38,806
But when you smile..

1543
01:49:39,748 --> 01:49:44,344
..oh, darling, when you smile,
that's what I live for.

1544
01:49:46,424 --> 01:49:49,292
When you smile.

1545
01:50:00,675 --> 01:50:02,701
Well, it's official.
CBS News now projects

1546
01:50:02,912 --> 01:50:05,211
Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw
to be the next president

1547
01:50:05,415 --> 01:50:07,280
and vice president
of the United States.

1548
01:50:07,484 --> 01:50:11,513
With at least 270 electoral votes
and support of almost 70 percent

1549
01:50:11,723 --> 01:50:13,315
of votes tallied tonight.

1550
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:15,289
Arthur and running mate
Raymond Shaw are leading

1551
01:50:15,495 --> 01:50:16,985
in all but one remaining race,

1552
01:50:17,197 --> 01:50:20,133
in the sitting vice president's
home state of Louisiana.

1553
01:50:36,155 --> 01:50:38,215
Wait, Jimmy. Jimmy, wait.

1554
01:50:38,793 --> 01:50:39,884
Wait. Go back.
Can you go back?

1555
01:50:40,093 --> 01:50:41,322
Yeah.

1556
01:50:45,634 --> 01:50:47,899
- Stop.
- Sure.

1557
01:50:48,539 --> 01:50:50,268
Now, can you zoom in on that guy?

1558
01:50:50,474 --> 01:50:51,669
Yep.

1559
01:50:52,076 --> 01:50:54,808
No, no, Jimmy, the other one. The one
in the back. The one in the shades.

1560
01:50:55,014 --> 01:50:56,914
- This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1561
01:51:02,857 --> 01:51:05,052
Never mind. Thanks, Jimmy.

1562
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:32,456
Arthur! That's right!

1563
01:51:32,664 --> 01:51:36,294
Arthur! Arthur!

1564
01:52:05,173 --> 01:52:07,471
- We did it. Wow.
- Yeah!

1565
01:52:08,444 --> 01:52:09,775
All right! Yes!

1566
01:52:10,312 --> 01:52:12,247
- Yes.
- Hi.

1567
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:24,956
Thank you. Thank you.

1568
01:52:25,433 --> 01:52:27,230
Thank you.

1569
01:52:36,414 --> 01:52:39,509
Let's have a good show, people.
Let's have a really good show, okay?

1570
01:52:40,853 --> 01:52:45,655
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

1571
01:52:46,227 --> 01:52:47,661
Cue screens.

1572
01:52:53,737 --> 01:52:55,135
Very good.

1573
01:53:02,081 --> 01:53:03,743
Stand by with the first music cue.

1574
01:53:04,151 --> 01:53:05,584
Now, music.

1575
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:31,827
Okay.

1576
01:55:01,705 --> 01:55:03,970
Damn it.
Shaw missed his first position.

1577
01:57:30,869 --> 01:57:33,235
AOP! AOP!

1578
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:34,963
Up there!

1579
01:58:00,542 --> 01:58:01,531
Ben!

1580
01:58:05,114 --> 01:58:06,103
Ben!

1581
01:58:32,182 --> 01:58:35,050
All right. Bye.

1582
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:33,186
The FBI has just released
security footage

1583
01:59:33,397 --> 01:59:35,958
of the assassin of Raymond
and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw

1584
01:59:36,167 --> 01:59:39,262
entering the hotel two hours
before the fatal shooting.

1585
01:59:39,471 --> 01:59:42,999
Authorities have identified
the gunman as Klaus Bachmann.

1586
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:46,180
Bachmann was believed to have been
killed in a car bomb explosion

1587
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,680
in Chechnya four years ago.

1588
01:59:48,884 --> 01:59:51,149
He was employed there as a
covert operation specialist

1589
01:59:51,354 --> 01:59:52,946
by Global Endeavors,

1590
01:59:53,156 --> 01:59:57,356
a U.K. subsidiary of the equity fund
giant Manchurian Global.

1591
01:59:57,562 --> 02:00:00,293
A second former Manchurian Global
civilian contractor

1592
02:00:00,499 --> 02:00:02,490
was taken into custody
by federal agents

1593
02:00:02,702 --> 02:00:05,536
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport
early this morning.

1594
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:08,800
Laurence Tokar made news
during the Gulf War

1595
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:12,743
for his presence on Raymond Shaw's
famed Lost Patrol.

1596
02:00:12,949 --> 02:00:16,477
Tokar was missing in action after
the ambush that resulted in Shaw

1597
02:00:16,687 --> 02:00:19,316
being awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1598
02:00:19,524 --> 02:00:23,256
Authorities are exploring additional
connections between the two men.

1599
02:00:23,463 --> 02:00:26,992
Still reeling from the recent tragic loss
of Senator Thomas Jordan,

1600
02:00:27,202 --> 02:00:30,138
Congress has already announced
a far-reaching investigation

1601
02:00:30,339 --> 02:00:31,567
into Jordan's death,

1602
02:00:31,774 --> 02:00:36,509
in an effort to learn if it is in any way
related to the Shaw assassinations.

1603
02:00:37,081 --> 02:00:41,075
In a supercharged encounter
moments ago, president-elect Arthur..

1604
02:01:22,542 --> 02:01:24,567
I remember running.

1605
02:01:25,478 --> 02:01:26,809
I had to..

1606
02:01:27,548 --> 02:01:29,106
..get out..

1607
02:01:31,086 --> 02:01:33,384
..to where the sky was. And had to..

1608
02:01:34,523 --> 02:01:38,119
..get to the water.
Escape. Regroup.

1609
02:01:38,563 --> 02:01:39,928
Come back, get my men.

1610
02:01:40,131 --> 02:01:43,932
I thought that if I could just
get to the water..

1611
02:01:45,237 --> 02:01:47,297
..everything would be okay.

1612
02:01:48,042 --> 02:01:50,510
If I could just get to the water.

1613
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:08,605
Now, when you're rescued
and returned with your patrol

1614
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:10,281
to command headquarters,

1615
02:03:10,484 --> 02:03:14,251
what will be among the first
of your duties that you'll undertake?

1616
02:03:14,455 --> 02:03:17,789
I'll recommend Sergeant Shaw
for the Medal of Honor, sir.

1617
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:19,995
He saved our lives.

1618
02:03:20,196 --> 02:03:24,065
He terminated the enemy.
Led us across the desert to safety.

1619
02:03:24,268 --> 02:03:26,897
Excellent. And there were casualties?

1620
02:03:27,105 --> 02:03:29,904
There's always casualties in war, sir.

1621
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,900
