1
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,168
Eva, we've got to go now!

2
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,337
Now, now!

3
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,633
Come on, Eva!

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,052
Come on, hurry!

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,514
Come on, run!
Eva, come on!

6
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,812
Come on, Eva.
We don't have time.

7
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,481
We don't have time.

8
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,654
- Come on, Eva!
- Get out the door!

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,159
- Run!
- Eva!

10
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,123
Go, go, go, go!

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,336
Mommy!

12
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,507
Get back!
Go on, go!

13
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,682
Hold on to me.

14
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,581
Let there be light.

15
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,965
Yeah.

16
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,102
Not exactly the Garden of Eden.

17
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,157
After a blast,
everything gets vaporized

18
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,786
and sucked up
into the atmosphere.

19
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,124
And it rains back down to earth..

20
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,213
as radioactive dust.

21
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,093
Number one rule:

22
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,429
no one opens that door

23
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,806
till the radiation clears.

24
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,143
You understand me?

25
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,441
You want to survive,
you listen to me.

26
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,171
Jesus!

27
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,014
Someone get the lights!

28
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,683
You okay? You okay?

29
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,561
- Someone get the lights!
- Calm down. Calm down.

30
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,481
Don't touch that.

31
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,621
Holy shit, it's the dust!
It's the dust!

32
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,500
That dust is from the inside.

33
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,502
The bitch is sealed tight.

34
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,545
What was that?
Another bomb?

35
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,090
That was our building
coming down.

36
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,299
How the fuck
do you know that?

37
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,968
I don't want to be down here.

38
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,804
I want to go now.

39
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,764
I know, sweetie.

40
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,475
But Uncle Mickey says
we have to stay.

41
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,269
- Why?
- Because your face will melt off

42
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,146
and your hair will fall out.

43
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,732
She's a little girl.

44
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,944
I was just fucking around.

45
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,906
- So that was a nuke?
- Definitely.

46
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,908
Fucking rag-heads.

47
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,661
- We got to stay down here?
- Bet your ass we do.

48
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,289
That door stays sealed
until the radiation clears.

49
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
And how long's that gonna take?

50
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,210
When I say.

51
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,757
What's the plan, Mickey?

52
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,802
Well, my plan was to build
a fallout shelter

53
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,556
and take it easy
while my pain-in-the-ass tenants

54
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,142
barbecued above me.

55
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,394
Does anybody's cell phones work?

56
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,021
No, there's no signal.

57
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,982
- I fucking lost mine.
- You lost it?

58
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,693
Ls that a radio?

59
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,237
Give it a try.

60
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,030
Cocksucking jack-off.

61
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,283
Hello?

62
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,326
Hello? Hello?

63
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,787
Hello, do you copy?

64
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,795
What's down here?

65
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,727
As you see, just a bunch
of storage cells full of junk.

66
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,606
Hey, uh..

67
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,858
uh, it's Mickey, right?

68
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,568
Yeah.

69
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,862
Why do you have
so many mattresses?

70
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,991
Because I'm the super
of a goddamn apartment building.

71
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,746
So why do you have
so many mattresses?

72
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,581
What the fuck do you care?

73
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,666
I sell them on the internet.

74
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,047
Turkish bath in here.

75
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,799
Sorry, ladies, no running water
to wash your panties.

76
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,511
Toilet's on the left.

77
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,681
It's septic,
so after you finish,

78
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,726
throw some lime on top of it.

79
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,730
That's fucking disgusting.

80
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,483
It's called saving water.

81
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,277
Sure, whatever.
I've got to take a dump.

82
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,909
What's in here?

83
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,871
That's my room.
Nobody goes in there but me.

84
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,499
Mama, I'm hungry.

85
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,921
Uh, Mickey..

86
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,714
do you have anything to eat?

87
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,357
The food is adequate, I hope.

88
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,901
Don't thank me all at once.

89
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,196
No, the food's good.
Thanks, Mickey.

90
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,871
Hello?

91
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,961
Hello? Hello?

92
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,881
Anybody there?

93
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,383
Hello?

94
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,261
Shut up back there.

95
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,680
Hello?

96
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,057
We have survivors

97
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,977
in a building
on the northwest corner

98
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,645
of 29th and 5th.

99
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:51,400
I repeat, the northwest corner
of 29th and 5th.

100
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,485
Do you copy?

101
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,994
Do you really
have to smoke that thing?

102
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,246
I mean, there's already
so much dust in here.

103
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,086
So when can we go up?

104
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,589
When I say so.

105
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,092
Fuck it.
Ade, come on, let's go.

106
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,511
Adrien, come on.
Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.

107
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,056
Let's go. Fuck it.

108
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,767
What do you think you're doing?

109
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,394
Get away from the door.
I won't tell you again.

110
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,189
- I told you!
- Josh!

111
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,942
- Look out!
- Get away from the fucking door!

112
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,779
- Get away from the goddamn door!
- Come on!

113
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,406
Go ahead.
Shit!

114
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,201
What the fuck, Mickey?

115
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,286
God damn it.

116
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,705
Fucking..

117
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,461
Fucking big man with that ax, huh?
Keep pushing me, Mickey.

118
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,129
Keep fucking pushing me,
you're gonna see what happens.

119
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,388
Ever see what happened
to those poor Japanese bastards..

120
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,518
after we dropped
Little Boy on Nagasaki?

121
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,021
The skin melting off their bones.

122
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,566
Faces like roadkill.

123
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,152
Lucky ones died in the blast.

124
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,780
And those kids in Chernobyl..

125
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,867
eyes and.. ears.

126
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,995
Shit growing all over 'em.

127
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,373
Tumors the size of grapefruits

128
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,708
popping out of their necks.

129
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,128
Enough, Mickey.
We get it.

130
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,838
What you need to get

131
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,467
is if that dust gets in here,
we're all fucked.

132
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,187
Hope not.

133
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,621
Come here, honey.
Let me braid your hair.

134
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,681
Can I borrow that, please?

135
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,433
Of course.

136
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

137
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,155
You kept it.

138
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,451
Of course I did.

139
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,204
Eva,

140
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm sorry if I've been acting
a little bit nuts.

141
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,793
I'm just trying, you know,

142
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,837
to keep it together.

143
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,089
I guess that's what survival is,

144
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,092
just trying to keep it together.

145
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,553
But I love you.

146
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,305
And you love me.

147
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,309
And that's what's going
to pull us through this nightmare.

148
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,936
It'll make us better parents.

149
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,070
Eva.

150
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,034
- Eva.
- What?

151
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,547
Come on, honey.
Just one more bite.

152
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,507
I want to go home.

153
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,052
Do you want me to try
and warm them up for you?

154
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,561
We are going to die, aren't we?

155
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,481
No, honey,
we're not going to die.

156
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,900
We're going to live.

157
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,736
Let's just do our meditation, okay?

158
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,488
Shut your eyes.

159
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,115
Really picture the beautiful light
and how good it makes us feel.

160
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,660
Let's do that right now, okay?
Come on.

161
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,371
- Shut your eyes.
- Lt doesn't work.

162
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,624
- It does work.
- I want to go home.

163
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:45,504
Wendy, you just have
to be patient, okay?

164
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,131
And then it'll get better outside.

165
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,634
And then somebody'll come down
and they'll help us.

166
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,428
- Promise?
- Promise.

167
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,181
Thank you.

168
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,817
Gonna have to eat this shit
every day?

169
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,276
What'd you say?

170
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
What?

171
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,701
I give you food,

172
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,496
shelter, and that's what you say?

173
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,043
Fuckers come down here,
expect me to take care of you.

174
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,296
What do you contribute?
What'd you bring to the fucking party?

175
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,382
Take it easy, Mickey.

176
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,178
All my family and friends
are probably dead,

177
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,057
and all you can talk about
are fucking beans?

178
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,437
Come on, Mick!

179
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,149
Are we really supposed
to rely on this guy?

180
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,817
- Sam.
- No, no, no, no, really, really.

181
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,361
How long can you keep us
alive in this.. in this..

182
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,572
- Shit hole.
- Yes, exactly.

183
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,824
You know what?
This is a fucking shit hole, man.

184
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,033
Calm down. Sam..

185
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,827
No. No, I'm sorry.
I won't stop.

186
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,996
- Stop.
- I won't stop because I want someone

187
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,998
to do something, that's all.

188
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,792
- I need someone to do something.
- Sam, calm down.

189
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,878
- No, I won't calm down because I..
- Sam.

190
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,046
Sam, please stop.
Stop!

191
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,341
- Do something, man. Come on!
- Sam, please stop.

192
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,844
Instead of just sitting around
waiting to fucking die.

193
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,352
Don't be scared, Wendy.

194
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,899
Uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.

195
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,527
And you're a big girl, aren't you?
Want to see a magic trick?

196
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,363
I'm gonna take my thumb off
for you, all right?

197
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,202
Yeeow!
God, that hurts.

198
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,413
Seen that one before?

199
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,124
Okay, let me think
of another one.

200
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,544
Making your cigar disappear?

201
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,061
Oh, shit.

202
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,396
Shit.

203
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,446
It's a rescue.

204
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,080
Down here!
Down here!

205
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,464
- Cut the lights.
- What the hell for?

206
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,800
Just do it.

207
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,718
You guys,
what's going on up there?

208
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,888
Hey, okay,
we're civilians, all right?

209
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,599
Okay, we're all
on the same side, right?

210
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,684
Whoa, what are you doing?

211
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,354
Didn't you hear him?

212
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,036
Mommy!

213
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,914
Help me!
No!

214
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,879
- No!
- Help me!

215
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,345
Wendy!

216
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,354
No, no!

217
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,235
No! No!

218
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,989
No!

219
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,033
Get back.

220
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,250
Go, go, go! Run!

221
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,171
God!

222
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,364
We've got another
2-8-Baker.

223
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,874
Give me the lock!
Give me the lock!

224
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,459
- What lock?
- Get me the chain!

225
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,297
- I don't need your help.
- Get out of the way.

226
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,175
Come on, come on.
Put the chain on there.

227
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,302
- Mickey!
- Hey, Mickey!

228
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,554
I need some help.
Adrien got shot.

229
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,098
- Put him down over here.
- What? Okay.

230
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,809
Whoa, whoa.

231
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,520
Hey, somebody fucking
get something. He got shot!

232
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,440
Oh, shit.

233
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,985
I got to look.

234
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,404
Oh, shit, Bobby.

235
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,323
- What the fuck?
- Somebody get a medical kit.

236
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,577
Thank you.

237
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,497
- I got it. I got it.
- I don't know what to do.

238
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,292
- I got it. I got it.
- There's nothing here that's usable.

239
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,003
It's all from, like,
1984 or something.

240
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,088
- You gotta take the bullet out, right?
- It's gonna sting, okay?

241
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,007
All right.

242
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,718
- Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.

243
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,387
- You're gonna be okay, man.
- He's gonna die.

244
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,389
- He's fine.
- He's gonna fucking die.

245
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,851
Shut up!
He's not gonna fucking die.

246
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,478
What do you want me to do?

247
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,564
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, all right?

248
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,358
- Arch your back. Just lean a bit.
- Come on.

249
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,361
- Almost got it.
- Almost? He's gonna be all right?

250
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,029
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He's gonna be okay.

251
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,906
You're lucky it didn't hit
the artery.

252
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,699
- He's gonna be okay.
- Okay, you got to clean that out.

253
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,992
I got it. Thank you.

254
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,953
Come over here.
Come over here.

255
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,080
Okay?

256
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,165
Put your hand on the back there.

257
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,125
Press hard on the front,
keep your hands on the back.

258
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,128
- That's fine. That's good.
- Yeah.

259
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,839
Just like that.
He'll be all right.

260
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,678
Where's Sam?

261
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,763
- Hold this.
- Yeah, I'm here.

262
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,016
- Hold this as hard as you can.
- I'm here. I'm here. I got it.

263
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,857
Sam. Sam.

264
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,866
You okay?
You hurt?

265
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,539
You're alive.

266
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:08,459
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?

267
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,424
I'm okay.

268
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,081
Looks like some sort
of biohazard suit.

269
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,167
It's a radiation suit.

270
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,837
Bet we got hit by one of those loose
nukes I've been reading about.

271
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,673
It's just a matter of time
before one of them hajis

272
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,592
got their hands on one of them.

273
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,053
So you're saying it's the Arabs?

274
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,472
Of course they're Arabs.

275
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,932
They've been at war
with us for 20 years.

276
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,518
It's just that we've been too busy

277
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,271
stuffing ourselves
at the trough to notice.

278
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,857
We should have wiped them
off the map when we had the chance.

279
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,817
Now it's probably too fucking late.

280
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,783
Oh, shit.

281
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,788
Okay, that's disgusting.

282
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,842
Let me guess, North Koreans.

283
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,554
- You're a fucking idiot.
- Get out of here.

284
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,473
Oh, fuck!

285
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,977
Holy shit.

286
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,648
Grab the tape.

287
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,111
I got her.
All right. Okay.

288
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,155
I got her. Ow!

289
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,324
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

290
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,493
Grab her arms.

291
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,165
Put her in the storage room.
Come on.

292
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,505
Get the door.
Get the door.

293
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,509
No!

294
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,201
Top rations.
Mickey's orders.

295
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,496
I'm fine. You take it.
You take it.

296
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,294
Can you make anything out?

297
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,380
Only thing I caught was something
about finishing up the sweep.

298
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,050
And they're American accents.

299
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,097
Turn off the fucking radio, man.

300
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,183
That's what got us in trouble
in the first place.

301
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,858
Hey, Mickey,
what is that in your pocket?

302
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,157
Whether it's making
a damn fine sausage

303
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,744
or exterminating
an entire race of people,

304
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,163
those Germans
don't fuck around.

305
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,248
You're holding out food
on us now?

306
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,501
I got a couple of bits and pieces
in my room.

307
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,504
It's my place.
It's my right.

308
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,256
- Just go back to your room.
- Damn it!

309
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,600
Has anyone fed Marilyn?

310
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,938
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Don't waste that.

311
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,774
What's so funny?

312
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,777
What?

313
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,946
What's so funny?

314
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,281
Oh, nothing.

315
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,534
Just what you said
and how you said it.

316
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,787
"Has anyone fed Marilyn yet?"
Like she's your fucking dog.

317
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,252
He gets it.

318
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,046
Show some respect.
She just lost her kid.

319
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,965
Go back to sleep, Adrien.

320
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,139
Where are you going?

321
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,600
Where are you going?

322
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,981
She's pissed.

323
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,943
You've got something on your face.

324
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,656
Other side.

325
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,702
That's it.

326
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:19,770
She's all that's good in me.

327
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,565
I'm sorry.

328
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,847
- Too risky.
- What do you mean it's too risky?

329
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,515
Whatever's in the air outside,
it's in here.

330
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,434
Your goddamn duct tape
won't make any difference.

331
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,269
At least we can find out
what's going on out there

332
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,812
even if we don't find her kid.

333
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,440
- You're volunteering?
- I'm volunteering.

334
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,567
He's volunteering.
I say if he wants to go, let him go.

335
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:10,071
- Let me go. Come on.
- I don't trust you coming back.

336
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,864
What is your problem with me?

337
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,283
- He's got a problem with everybody.
- What about Josh?

338
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,910
- No. Fuck, no.
- Me?

339
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,411
- What about Josh?
- You want me to go?

340
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,955
He ain't got the brains
and that faggot ain't got the balls.

341
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,375
- He'll come back for his brother.
- Thanks, Mickey.

342
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,959
I'll go.

343
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,170
No, no, no, Eva.
Eva, you can't be serious.

344
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,756
- I'll go.
- Don't be stupid.

345
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,758
- I'll go.
- You happy, Mick?

346
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,843
You a punk. You know that?
You a punk.

347
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,055
When you ain't got no ax in your hand,
then you got something to say.

348
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,435
I don't think he's gonna like
what he finds out there.

349
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,939
At least we have to try.

350
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,287
Glove.

351
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,464
- How's your tube?
- Tube is good.

352
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,758
Excuse me.

353
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,927
Do you have air?
Is it working?

354
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,763
- You got one more to go.
- Ls the compressor gonna work?

355
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,349
- Yeah, it's fine.
- There it is.

356
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,145
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

357
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,813
Let's go.

358
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,029
Promise me you'll bring her back.

359
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,576
I'll do my best.

360
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,250
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

361
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,514
Let's do it.

362
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,196
What the hell is that?

363
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,040
Hey, Josh.

364
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,126
Don't worry, man.
L.. l got this.

365
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,816
Wendy.

366
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,031
Hold it.

367
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,352
Go.

368
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,276
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

369
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,487
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What did you see?

370
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,406
- You're okay.
- I think I got two of 'em.

371
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,907
- What did you see?
- Where's your gun?

372
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,702
They got this.. this lab set up there.
It's like.. it's like..

373
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,496
- Josh, what else?
- Like what?

374
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,248
- What else?
- What do you mean what else?

375
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,250
That's it.
There's no survivors.

376
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,003
There's no other civilians.
There's no fucking Red Cross.

377
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,591
I don't know if they're army.
I don't even know if they're American.

378
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,951
I'm sorry.

379
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,594
They're coming back.

380
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,304
No.

381
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,682
They're welding us in.

382
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,790
- How are you holding up?
- Uh, I'll live.

383
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,627
Delvin gave me his pain meds.

384
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,962
Mind if I take a look?

385
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,300
I just want to clean it.

386
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,889
You know it's gonna sting a little.

387
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,516
Sorry.

388
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,898
You a nurse or something?

389
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,026
No.

390
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,820
You're just gonna have
a nasty scar.

391
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,698
Yeah, well,
chicks dig scars, right?

392
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,292
You lived below us, right?

393
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,169
Yep.

394
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,046
Was that you who played guitar?

395
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,757
Yeah. Did that annoy you?

396
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,842
No.

397
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,262
No, I actually really liked it.

398
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,681
Helped me sleep sometimes.

399
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,851
It keeps most people awake.

400
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,065
Not me.

401
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,582
Ls everything all right?

402
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,627
Yeah. Everything's fine.

403
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,401
Ugh, how can you
eat with that smell?

404
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,902
We've got to get rid
of those bodies.

405
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,863
How, exactly?

406
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,158
Chop 'em up,
toss 'em down the septic.

407
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,785
Should have tried harder
to get that door open.

408
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:27,789
That door is welded shut.

409
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,335
We should have put the bodies out
when Josh went out.

410
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,046
Shame we let
those bodies go rotten.

411
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,589
What do you mean?

412
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:39,134
You ever heard about that rugby team
that survived the Andes?

413
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,927
Their plane crashed.

414
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,013
They were forced to eat
their friends and family.

415
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,973
They survived up there
for months.

416
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,433
They ate everything..

417
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:50,520
ears, toes, assholes.

418
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,940
Uh-huh, arms, legs,
brains, the spleen.

419
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,443
The only thing they didn't eat
was the penis.

420
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,113
If worse comes to worst, you all have
full permission to eat my body.

421
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,991
Yeah, you do.
But not my penis.

422
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,119
Nobody.. nobody but nobody

423
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,122
eats Bobby's penis.

424
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,253
What's that for, Mickey?

425
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,469
Uh-uh.

426
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,807
Delvin?

427
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,190
Well, yeah.

428
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,194
Fuck, yeah.

429
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,655
Yeah, I'll do it.

430
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,866
Come on.

431
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,694
I can do this, man.
I got this.

432
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,119
But can he live with it?

433
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,879
- Hey, Bobby?
- I got this, man.

434
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,674
Yeah, I'll be.. fine.

435
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,856
It's just like cutting lumber.

436
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,941
I'll start with the arms.

437
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,990
I'll just get my swing down.

438
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,750
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

439
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:20,754
Chop a body from head to toe.

440
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,501
It's blunt.

441
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,978
Man, what you doing in here?

442
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,855
What?

443
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,440
How did you get in here, man?
I heard you.

444
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,191
- When did you come in here?
- Fuck off.

445
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,445
How did you get in here?
What you got in your pocket?

446
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,823
Punk.

447
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,961
I was dreaming about Mom.

448
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,715
You think she's okay?

449
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,925
I don't care.

450
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,720
She's your mom.
She's not mine.

451
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:42,390
Just 'cause she cut
my sandwiches..

452
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,901
- Hey, Adrien.
- Yeah?

453
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,739
I only went out there to see
if there's a way out for us.

454
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,293
Hey, was Mickey an aviator
or something?

455
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,587
Look at these.

456
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,965
What the hell's going on in here?

457
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,135
Come on, Mickey, we're just looking
for some escapism, all right?

458
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,681
I told you from day one
that this was my room

459
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,474
and you were to stay out.

460
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:10,395
Your casa is our casa now.

461
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,483
I don't know what
you're talking about,

462
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,236
but you're gonna regret this.

463
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,154
This is my ball.

464
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,323
You got it out of my apartment?

465
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,201
- I got it out of your ass.
- You got it out of my apartment.

466
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,788
Hey, he's got forks.

467
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,625
- Adrien.
- I've been looking for this ball.

468
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,335
Don't need to use
your dirty fingers any.. hey!

469
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:37,714
- This is a very valuable ball.
- You got it fixed.

470
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:43,469
Hit down here, come this way,
and jab real hard

471
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,597
and start firing like this.

472
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,224
Now if they're behind you
and they have a gun behind you..

473
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,102
- This is amazing.
- ..what you want to do is feel that tip.

474
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,897
Once you feel it,
come to the outside.

475
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,940
The gun will discharge this way.

476
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,192
Take your arm,
take both their hands,

477
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,613
pull with this hand, and go forward
and you'll take the gun away.

478
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,990
All right, soldier,
fight safe

479
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,367
and come back
to the United States.

480
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,867
- Oh, another one?
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,411
- Where the hell did you get that one?
- It's the last one.

482
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,413
Come in.

483
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,834
Hi.

484
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,087
Here's the makeup.

485
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,297
Thanks.

486
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,341
Makeup.

487
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,769
Hey, listen, Marilyn.

488
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:18,356
You know, if you need
to talk about anything,

489
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,067
anything like that,
I'm here.

490
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,613
You know?
'Cause..

491
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,617
I'm sure she's better off
than we are right now.

492
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,787
What are you talking about?

493
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,917
Wendy.

494
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,134
Eva.

495
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:50,013
You are a very beautiful girl.

496
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,604
And I know you know
what men are like.

497
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,525
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think's gonna happen

498
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,736
the longer that we stay
down here, huh?

499
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,072
What do you think
is already happening?

500
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,158
- I don't know.
- I do.

501
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:17,832
Listen, if you need to talk
about anything, I'm here, all right?

502
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,418
Don't you think
you should just be

503
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,712
a little nicer
to the rest of the boys?

504
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,048
Especially Josh.

505
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,509
Fucking hands off me.

506
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,517
All you knew
we had was this much?

507
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,228
That's all there is!
What do you want me to do?

508
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,939
- That's not all there is.
- That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.

509
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,400
That's impossible. There is no way
we can survive with that.

510
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,943
No way. No way.

511
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
You got us
into this situation, now fix it.

512
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:52,784
I got us into this situation?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

513
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,535
I was rationing them.

514
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,120
We're gonna fucking starve
to death, Mickey.

515
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,122
We're gonna die of thirst, Mickey.
Where's the food?

516
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,916
What do you want me to do?

517
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,710
I'm not your nanny,
you arrogant prick!

518
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,462
I'll bet you're just waiting
for one of us to die

519
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,465
so you can have all the food
that you can fucking eat, huh?

520
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,884
Oh, shit. What are you..

521
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,595
What is your problem, Mickey?
What is your problem?

522
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,056
My problem is you!

523
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,891
- You're fucking dead.
- And you, and you!

524
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,476
- You're fucking dead, Mickey.
- You're my fucking problem!

525
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,895
- Get back. Get out of here.
- You get out of here!

526
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,480
- Take a walk.
- You get out of here.

527
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,524
- It's my fucking..
- Take a fucking walk!

528
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,276
Guys, please.
Delvin, come on.

529
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,331
You see he's the only one
not dropping any pounds?

530
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,167
Always stuffing his pig face.

531
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,670
I'm telling you, that motherfucker
is up to something.

532
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:52,593
Stop playing around with that.
Okay? I'm trying to talk to you.

533
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,011
What do you want to do, Josh?

534
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,264
I want to get
that fucking door open,

535
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,683
- even if we rip it off its hinges.
- Fucking-A right, man.

536
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,602
Do you agree with everything
my brother says?

537
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,565
You mean
your half-brother, right?

538
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,817
What, you don't agree?

539
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,951
Have you looked at us?
Huh?

540
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,121
Look at me.
We're dying in here.

541
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,331
Where would you rather be?

542
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,669
Door's welded shut.

543
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,672
We got one working suit.

544
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,091
There's not a lot of options.

545
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,720
There's always options.

546
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,041
I knew you had some stuff
in here somewhere.

547
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:48,834
You crazy fuck.

548
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,879
It's a peace offering for..

549
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,382
Thank you. Uh-huh.

550
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,217
Back up.

551
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,471
Back up and open it.

552
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,014
All right.

553
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,272
Move over so I can see it.

554
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,148
Start again.

555
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,110
Don't give me an excuse
to use this. Open it.

556
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,908
Got it.
Now push it open.

557
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,246
- Where's it lead to?
- The fucking White House.

558
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:28,249
- Where are the lights?
- There ain't no fucking lights.

559
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,668
Don't you fuck with me.

560
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,089
Oh, man.

561
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,945
Help!

562
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,448
It's Delvin and Mickey.

563
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,669
Holy shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?

564
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,088
This motherfucker,
he comes in here

565
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,883
and he sticks a Taser in my face,
and he said he was gonna kill me

566
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,676
unless I gave him the rest
of the food and water.

567
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:25,056
Then he.. he goes for the gun.
I caught him off guard.

568
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,184
Then we started fighting
over the gun and it went off.

569
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,813
- It went off?
- Yeah, it just went off.

570
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,066
And that's it.

571
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,610
It was self-defense.

572
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,487
It was..

573
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,948
- it was self-defense.
- Stop!

574
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,492
- Get off me!
- Bobby, get him!

575
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,869
It was self-defense,
motherfucker!

576
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,996
Adrien, help me!

577
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,207
Sam, get his legs!
Get his legs!

578
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,335
- Get his legs!
- Get off, motherfucker!

579
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,504
- Eva, get the gun!
- Get off!

580
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,714
- Hold on to him!
- Get off me!

581
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:17,233
It's a combination lock.
It won't work.

582
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,944
It's a combination lock.

583
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,738
Somebody wake him up.

584
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,199
You know what I think?

585
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:28,244
I think we should kill
the maniac right now.

586
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,579
- Jesus, Bobby.
- Hey, Mickey.

587
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,873
All right, let's fucking do it.

588
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,417
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby.

589
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,210
Let's get civilized
about this, please.

590
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,587
Come on. Josh?

591
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,798
You saw what he did to Delvin.
Huh? The guy's a whack-job.

592
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:44,009
He has been fucking with us
since the first..

593
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,054
You know what?
Give me the gun.

594
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:50,057
Give me the gun.
Eva.

595
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,892
You don't even know
what happened.

596
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,061
- Give me the gun.
- Let's get to the bottom of this first.

597
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,440
- What are you doing? You bitch!
- Josh.

598
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,192
- What if those guys come back, huh?
- Josh, come on.

599
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,528
Get the fuck out of my way.
Fuck.

600
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,322
We need the fucking
combination, Mickey.

601
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,867
The combination.

602
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,911
- Aah!
- What is the combination?

603
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,416
Sam.

604
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:18,836
What's behind that door?
Put his head forward.

605
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,214
- Aah!
- What's behind that door?

606
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,633
- What's behind that door?
- You're gonna die.

607
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,844
- You're all gonna die.
- Huh?

608
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,388
I'll never give you
the combination.

609
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,057
Go get the knife.

610
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,767
- No?
- I don't care what you do to me!

611
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,437
You can kill me!
I don't care if I die!

612
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,606
- You don't care if you die?
- No! I kind of want it.

613
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,774
- Aah!
- Huh? You want to die?

614
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,611
As long as I'm strapped
in this chair, I'm stronger than you.

615
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,363
You're never gonna get
that combination from me.

616
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,575
- Never!
- No?

617
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,620
And I will starve to death.
Will you?

618
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,623
- Bobby!
- Give me the fucking combination,

619
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,625
Mickey, or I'll slice you
from ear to ear.

620
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,960
- You hear me?
- Stop!

621
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,880
- You're so fucking dead.
- No! Get off of me, you faggot!

622
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:06,133
Get off of me, you faggot!
I'll starve to death.

623
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,469
Put the knife down,
you guys, please.

624
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,515
You shouldn't have thrown
the gun down the toilet, Eva.

625
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,475
- Fuckers! Fuckers!
- Come on, Josh, think about it.

626
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:16,143
- What's the combination?
- Fuck you!

627
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,437
- Put down the knife.
- Yeah, do it.

628
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:21,106
- Josh, no!
- What's the combination?

629
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,484
- Put down the knife.
- Do it! Do it!

630
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,319
Josh, no!

631
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,946
- Stop!
- What's the..

632
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,031
Let her go, Josh.
Let her go. Let her go.

633
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,659
I don't know why
you wanna fight, boy.

634
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,827
Okay, okay, Josh.
Josh, look at me.

635
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,663
- Look at me.
- Stop it, Josh!

636
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,456
- I'll cut that pretty neck of yours.
- Fuck you!

637
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,501
- Keep the fuck back!
- Look at me, Josh. Look at me.

638
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,670
I think it would be a better idea

639
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,589
before we torture someone,
you let your anger pass.

640
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,759
If I have to calm down
and rationalize this,

641
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:52,680
I don't know if I'll be able to take
a knife and cut his fucking fingers off.

642
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,848
- Do it!
- No.

643
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,979
Last chance, Mickey.

644
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,522
How about that?

645
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,857
How about that's your
last chance, you fuckin'..

646
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,861
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Fucking yuppie.

647
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,780
- Do it. Do it.
- Do it. Do it.

648
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,157
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Do it. Go ahead.

649
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,953
Go ahead and do it!
Do it, faggot, do it!

650
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,875
How's that feel, huh?
How's that feel?

651
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,712
How does that fucking feel?

652
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,466
Oh, God.

653
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,886
It's okay. It's okay.

654
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,764
Look at that. Look at that.
There it is, huh?

655
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,518
See how easy that thing came off?

656
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,523
- Hey, Josh, let's do another one.
- Another one?

657
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,233
- Yeah. Let's do a thumb.
- You want a thumb?

658
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,235
- Nine!
- Nine, motherfucker?

659
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,821
- No!
- What's the combination?

660
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,408
Mickey, give him
the combination, please!

661
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:56,160
Okay. Okay.

662
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,662
- Nine.
- Nine. Come on.

663
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:02,041
11, then zero, then one.

664
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,836
9-11-0-1.
Now he's a fucking canary.

665
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,173
That wasn't so hard,
was it, Mickey?

666
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:11,258
Go get the door open.

667
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:14,345
9-11-0-1 . Go.

668
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,513
Just fucking go!

669
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,477
You faggots!

670
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,687
Faggot, you'll never
amount to anything.

671
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,440
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

672
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,778
You're a fucking coward!

673
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,279
- Coward!
- Nice souvenir, huh?

674
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,947
- Yeah.
- You fucking cowards!

675
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,574
Hey, Mickey, I got you
in my pocket now.

676
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,117
Oh, that's funny.

677
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,953
You're real funny,
you stupid shit.

678
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:44,708
A fucking brain the size
of a fucking pea, you fucking idiot.

679
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,795
You red-headed stepchild.
And you, you fuck!

680
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,589
You're a fucking coward, man.

681
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,967
Fuck you!

682
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,604
Mickey.

683
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,986
Mickey.

684
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,576
Won't you play with me?

685
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,062
Ooh, they got beans.

686
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,732
See, I told you
he was holding out on us.

687
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,234
We should still kill him.

688
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,486
Shut up, Bobby.

689
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,225
What did you find?

690
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,103
Nothing.

691
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,490
Hey, Mickey,

692
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,242
you want to see a magic trick?

693
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,462
Now you're not alone.

694
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,457
You fucking missed.

695
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,295
You missed.

696
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,463
You want it, Sam?

697
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,524
Oh, my God.

698
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,860
Oh, God damn it.

699
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:42,029
That's disgusting.

700
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,531
Marilyn.

701
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,038
Don't waste that, Marilyn.

702
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,335
I'm sorry.

703
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,546
- I'm sorry.
- Clean yourself up.

704
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,136
Let me massage you.

705
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,388
No, it just.. it hurts.

706
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,557
- All right? Just..
- I can make you feel better.

707
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,809
No, just.. just stay
off me, all right?

708
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,437
Marilyn, I don't think
he wants to be touched.

709
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,981
You stink, okay?
Just stay off me.

710
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,567
I said get off of me!

711
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:25,697
Stay.

712
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:31,787
Marilyn, why don't you
put some clothes on?

713
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,084
That filthy nightie is disgusting.
I can't even eat.

714
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,854
Well, thanks, Sam.

715
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:02,859
Now why don't you go over there
and suck on his dick?

716
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,570
You should suck his dick
because we all know

717
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,614
that he's not getting any at home.

718
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:11,034
What, Sam, her pussy like
the fucking Sahara or something?

719
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:14,162
All right, Josh, let it go.

720
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:24,631
Marilyn, let me ask you a question.

721
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,843
Why is it that old women
can't age gracefully?

722
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,594
Your tits are at your waist.

723
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,347
Someone pulled the ripcord
on your inflatable ass.

724
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,475
And your skin
is like fucking sand..

725
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,602
- Josh, leave her alone.
- Stay out of it!

726
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,981
- I'm not a child.
- No, she's not.

727
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,775
But I like that.

728
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,739
Stop it.

729
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,534
Oh, what?

730
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,912
Yeah.
Oh, you, too, Sam?

731
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,789
Yeah, go fetch her, boy.

732
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,221
Eva.

733
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,849
Eva.

734
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,523
- I can't stand it in here.
- Shh.

735
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,610
It's okay.
It's okay.

736
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,614
Sam.

737
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,824
- Sam.
- Come on, Eva.

738
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,035
- Sam, please stop. Please stop.
- Please, please, please.

739
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,204
- Sam, just go away.
- Please, please.

740
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,915
- Sam, stop it.
- Eva, please.

741
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,169
Sam, get off of me!

742
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,417
Josh, do I look like
a space alien? Huh?

743
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,767
Holy Mary, mother of God,

744
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,061
pray for us sinners now

745
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,607
and at the hour of our death.

746
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,512
Hey.

747
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,890
Yeah?

748
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,226
How about a drink?

749
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,311
Sure.

750
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,695
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

751
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,698
Cheers.

752
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,799
Thank you.

753
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,169
I should go.

754
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,046
Yeah.

755
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:58,631
Liz?

756
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:02,093
I'm so sorry about everything.

757
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:12,145
Come on, you motherfuckers!

758
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:16,983
Come and get me!
I got nine more fingers for you!

759
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,195
Hey, Marilyn.

760
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,863
- It's gonna be okay.
- Where are you, baby?

761
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:05,573
- It's gonna be okay.
- Bring back that sweet ass.

762
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,618
- You stay with us. Don't worry.
- Marilyn.

763
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,413
- You stay with us.
- Oh, there she is.

764
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,081
- She got off the leash again.
- It's okay.

765
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,084
Marilyn. Marilyn.
Come back to bed.

766
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,420
She's gonna stay in here
with us, all right?

767
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,048
Josh, let her stay in here.

768
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,633
- Marilyn.
- No!

769
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,761
Come on, let her go.
Let her go.

770
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,098
- Let her go!
- Eva, she's yours.

771
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,975
Marilyn! Marilyn!

772
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:33,643
- Let her go!
- Eva, wait, wait.

773
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,895
- Let her go!
- Wait, let it go.

774
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,398
Aah! Fuck!

775
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,901
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

776
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,613
I'm sorry.

777
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,078
It's okay. I'm fine.

778
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,886
Sorry to interrupt.

779
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,430
You guys have to Mickey-sit.

780
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:14,642
And Josh would like
to see you alone.

781
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,040
This looked like your size.

782
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,087
What do you want, Josh?

783
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,426
Decided you should ration
your own food and water.

784
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,473
Ls this for the three of us?

785
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,976
No, two.
Mickey's fasting.

786
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,021
Okay.

787
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,691
Of course, Eva, if you want more,
I'm open to barter.

788
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,240
No?

789
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,659
Maybe I'll just take this back.

790
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:18,289
What's going on?

791
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:21,167
I'm rationing the supplies.

792
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,754
Yeah, well, Josh,
they're the group's supplies.

793
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,798
It's not your call.

794
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:29,801
Well, groups break down into
self-interest during times of scarcity.

795
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:31,761
And someone needs to make
the tough decisions

796
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,429
during times of war.

797
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,352
It's in the DVDs.

798
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,688
So what's next, huh?

799
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,190
You cut off Bobby?

800
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,318
Then me?

801
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,537
Bro..

802
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:00,373
there is only us.

803
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,276
Let's do it again.

804
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,497
Oh, God, more. More.

805
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,709
- I have to ration it.
- Ration your end.

806
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,170
This is our end.
This is what Josh gave us.

807
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,923
Get me out of this chair.

808
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,843
You held out on us, Mickey.

809
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:56,304
I was gonna tell you
about the food.

810
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:59,849
But first I had to make sure
that when this supply ran low,

811
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:03,144
who I could trust
and who would go bad.

812
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,938
Eva, come here.

813
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,775
- Come here. Eva.
- What?

814
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,777
Come here.

815
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,449
There's something in the storage
room they don't know about.

816
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:19,035
- What?
- It's a gun.

817
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:37,679
Sam.

818
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,014
You have to do something.

819
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,891
What the fuck
are you talking about?

820
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,434
He told me there's another gun.

821
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,645
He's a compulsive liar

822
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:47,438
and a fucking murderer.

823
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:50,358
If you won't help me,
I'll do it alone, Sam.

824
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,821
What are you gonna do
when you find that fictional gun?

825
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:57,156
Are you gonna kill them?

826
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:59,158
We can't provoke them.

827
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,203
I can talk some sense
into them. Yeah.

828
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,247
I was a fucking lawyer,
remember?

829
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:06,666
I was a fucking..

830
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:09,210
Sam, wake up.

831
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:13,423
You were nothing, just a fucking
drug addict living on the streets.

832
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,259
So don't you dare
to tell me to wake up.

833
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:51,294
You got to be a cowboy.
Cowboys touch penises.

834
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:54,297
- Do it. Do it.
- No, no.

835
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:56,340
- I'm not gonna touch it.
- Touch it.

836
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,843
- No way.
- He doesn't want to touch it.

837
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,429
- He doesn't want to do it.
- Do that other thing.

838
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,431
- The big one?
- The big one.

839
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,224
What did I just say?

840
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,727
- The little one.
- But you said..

841
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:09,854
Little dog.

842
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,399
The little one.

843
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,943
The little one is a..

844
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,742
The little one choking.
The little one choking.

845
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,745
Give him a treat.

846
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,997
All right, here we go.

847
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,082
- Eva beaver.
- Wow.

848
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,376
- Come on in.
- No, I just need to talk to Sam.

849
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,337
Well, we're in the middle
of a game here.

850
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,506
Sam, I need to talk to you.

851
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,717
- I haven't finished yet.
- He hasn't finished.

852
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:48,267
Oh, don't worry about Marilyn.
She's zoned out.

853
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,149
You know what?
You should play.

854
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:57,944
Yeah, come on.
Come on in.

855
01:25:58,111 --> 01:25:59,779
I insist.

856
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:03,407
There we go.
There we go.

857
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,791
Get her a drink, Sancho.

858
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,254
Thank you, maître d'.

859
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,132
So, Eva..

860
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,802
truth or dare?

861
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,804
I'm not gonna play.

862
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,974
You're gonna play 'cause
you're sitting at my fucking table.

863
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:31,894
How about we play
for food and water?

864
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,857
So come on.

865
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,984
Truth or dare?

866
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,321
Truth.

867
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,160
Do you love Sam?

868
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,538
- Good question.
- Come on.

869
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,790
There's no getting out
of this one, Eva.

870
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,668
Do you love Sammy?

871
01:26:58,088 --> 01:26:59,547
Yes.

872
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,967
Ooh, congratulations, Sam.

873
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,766
And my brother?

874
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,352
You already asked
your question.

875
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,229
That is true, Josh.
Those are the rules.

876
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,481
- That's true.
- Fuck, she got me, man.

877
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,317
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, um..

878
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,028
it's your turn to ask.
So come on.

879
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,363
Ask a question.
It's your turn.

880
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,617
Come on, just say,

881
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:30,703
"Josh, truth or dare?"

882
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,204
Ask a question.

883
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:37,752
Okay, dare.
No, truth.

884
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,754
Last time I said dare,
Bobby wanted me

885
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,089
to eat Mickey's finger.

886
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,050
You're a sick fuck.

887
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,970
Fucking disgusting.
So come on, ask a question.

888
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,061
Ask a fucking question.

889
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,240
- Ask a fucking question!
- Did you enjoy torturing Mickey?

890
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,912
No.

891
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,748
I did what had to be done.

892
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,250
But what have you done for us?

893
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,253
Huh?

894
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,255
- Come on, Josh.
- Okay, fuck it, Sam.

895
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:26,592
What's up? You want a turn?
Truth or dare?

896
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,178
Dare.
Go cut up Delvin's body.

897
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,439
Come on, Sammy.
Circle of truth.

898
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,442
You accepted the dare, Sammy.
Time to follow through.

899
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,906
- I'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.

900
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:52,410
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Huh?

901
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,620
Do it.

902
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,998
- Stop.
- Do it.

903
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,960
- You got a penis, Sam?
- I'm not cutting anyone.

904
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,379
- Do it.
- Bobby, stop it.

905
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,297
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it.

906
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:08,634
Eva, how can you be engaged
to such a pussy?

907
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,220
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it! Do it!

908
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:12,972
- Do it!
- Stop it!

909
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,558
Atta boy.

910
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:18,811
Sam, sit down.
Sam, sit down.

911
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,648
Sam, don't!

912
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,984
Sam, don't.

913
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,619
Help me.

914
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,833
Sam, don't.
You don't have to prove yourself.

915
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,127
- You don't have to do this.
- All right, Sam, now remember,

916
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,755
it's just like chopping lumber,
but not.

917
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,882
All right, knock yourself out.

918
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:50,051
Go for it.

919
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:55,097
- Hold it high.
- No.

920
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,350
Don't.

921
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,436
Come on.

922
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,194
- You fucking pussy.
- Why don't you do it, Bobby?

923
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,488
You love chopping up people.
Why don't you do it?

924
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,407
Well, you see,
I've already cut up a body.

925
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,993
- Give me a kiss. Right here.
- Whoo!

926
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,120
I think we know who
the man of the house is.

927
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,414
- Get the fuck.. get off me.
- Robert.

928
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,541
- Get off me.
- Get the ax.

929
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,544
- No, no, no, no, I can do it!
- You're gonna cut him up.

930
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,549
- Josh, don't!
- What are you doing?

931
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,844
Do it or I break his arms.

932
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,888
Come on.

933
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:46,732
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it.

934
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,069
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!

935
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:53,405
Do it! Do it! Do it!

936
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:27,333
Who's next?

937
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,337
Bobby.

938
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:40,512
So how's a little bit
off the top?

939
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,348
You ready?

940
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:44,308
Okay.

941
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,555
Look at us, huh?
Look at us.

942
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,726
- Yeah.
- We're the same.

943
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,313
The same.

944
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,400
You're my brother now.

945
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,874
Where's the gun?

946
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,085
Get me out of this chair.

947
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,678
It's in a red coffee can

948
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,930
in the panic room.

949
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,099
I never said I'd untie you.

950
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,143
You'll do the right thing.

951
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,695
Eva,

952
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:04,573
there's another way out.

953
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:07,701
- What?
- Through the septics.

954
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,624
But you're gonna be swimming
through a whole lot of god-awful shit.

955
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,281
You know it's in the hair?

956
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:48,409
It's in the hair.

957
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:52,413
What's the going rate
on a bottle of water, Sancho?

958
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,623
Got to be some infidelity for sure.

959
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,960
- Yeah.
- No.

960
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:00,838
Stop. Stop.

961
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,881
She sounds like
a racehorse, Robert.

962
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,883
I'll bet she goes off like one, too.

963
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,718
- Please.
- Don't spoil it.

964
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:09,513
- Please, not like this.
- Not like what?

965
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:14,810
- Robert.
- What?

966
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:18,105
- Get lost.
- I thought we could share this one.

967
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,196
Oh, God.

968
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:28,615
It's in the hair.

969
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,587
She just broke.

970
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:52,598
Hey.

971
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:57,519
- What happened?
- Marilyn's dead.

972
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:59,354
They killed her.

973
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,273
You okay?

974
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,651
What are you doing?

975
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:48,320
You have to get the gun.
In the panic room.

976
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,364
- Where?
- Ln the red coffee can.

977
01:37:50,532 --> 01:37:53,242
- Hey, assholes.
- Oh, God.

978
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,577
You're supposed to keep
the batteries charged.

979
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:57,287
We're trying to watch a movie.

980
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,706
Yes, Bobby, but it just died.

981
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,375
- All of a sudden.
- What the fuck, Sam?

982
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:04,169
It just died?
What the fuck?

983
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,664
Store's closed.

984
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,865
Not here. Not here.

985
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:17,701
Not here, please.

986
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,203
Please.

987
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:27,377
Come with me.

988
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:50,484
This is your fault.
You didn't fucking charge the battery.

989
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:53,070
- Sorry. Yeah, yeah, well..
- Oh, shit.

990
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,781
Why do you look so nervous, Sam?
Huh? Go do something.

991
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,908
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.

992
01:39:58,076 --> 01:39:59,993
You're right. I'm sorry.

993
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,995
- Where are you going?
- I need to go to the toilet.

994
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:04,373
I'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.

995
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,760
Wait. Wait.

996
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:19,763
Why don't you just slow down?

997
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,890
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.

998
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:24,309
Oh, bitte.
Oh, bitte.

999
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,228
Oh, bitte.

1000
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,407
What are you doing, Sam?

1001
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:40,826
Well, you said you were
going to the bathroom.

1002
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,328
The bathroom's down the hall
and to the left.

1003
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:46,123
I'm just starving, Bobby.

1004
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,543
I need something to eat.

1005
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:51,628
Okay.

1006
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,135
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

1007
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:03,932
You know, I'm standing here
and you're standing there,

1008
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,977
and we're both thinking
the same thing, aren't we?

1009
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:08,645
What?

1010
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,692
Please, get me out of this chair.

1011
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:17,404
Get me out of this chair.
Get me out of this chair.

1012
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:21,700
Please, get me out of this chair.

1013
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,953
Are you my friend, Sam?

1014
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,831
Yes, I'm your friend.
What.. what are you doing, Bobby?

1015
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:30,167
Will you be my Sancho, Sam?

1016
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,085
- Your what?
- My Sancho.

1017
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:34,045
- Sancho Panza?
- Sure.

1018
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:36,923
What? Sure.
Yes, I'll be your Sancho..

1019
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,843
Say please, pussy.

1020
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,180
Pussy?

1021
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:45,265
- Please.
- Please.

1022
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:48,935
- Pussy.
- Pussy.

1023
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,979
- Please, pussy.
- Please.

1024
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,273
- Pretty please, pussy.
- Pretty please.

1025
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,192
- Pussy. Not just pussy.
- Pussy.

1026
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,778
- Pussy. Pussy.
- Pussy. Pussy.

1027
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:08,538
Now say it in French.

1028
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,879
I don't know what you just said,
but that sounded sexy as fuck.

1029
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,964
- Now suck my dick.
- What?

1030
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,550
- Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
- What? No.

1031
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,844
- Suck my dick!
- No, no, no!

1032
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:24,721
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, Bobby.

1033
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,015
- Bobby, come on.
- Suck it.

1034
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,100
- Bobby. Bobby, come on.
- Suck my dick.

1035
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:31,102
- Suck my dick.
- Bobby!

1036
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,480
Bobby, stop! Ah!

1037
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:36,316
Stop it!

1038
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,652
Stop!

1039
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:50,455
I'm just fucking with you, Sam.

1040
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:53,083
Yeah, we changed the combination
two weeks ago.

1041
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,549
Open sesame.

1042
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:02,592
I don't think we have croissants.

1043
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,095
I know how you Frenchies
love that shit.

1044
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:08,557
But I'll find you something.

1045
01:43:09,976 --> 01:43:11,768
Wait, wait.

1046
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:14,062
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1047
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:17,816
I don't want to just fuck you.
Wait, wait, please.

1048
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:20,193
You were right about Sam.

1049
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:23,738
Sam's not a real man like you.
You're right.

1050
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:26,283
I need a real man.

1051
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,584
What are you doing?

1052
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:38,128
I want to touch you.

1053
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,464
I just want to touch you.

1054
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:44,509
What, I said, are you doing?

1055
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:48,221
- What are you doing?
- I just wanted to touch your skin.

1056
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:56,938
- You want some apricots?
- Apricots are for faggots.

1057
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,151
I like apricots.

1058
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:15,332
You know, Sam,
you really blew it big time.

1059
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:18,919
You know, I knew
Josh would tap that ass.

1060
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,964
You really blew it.

1061
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,968
What the fuck
are you doing, Sam?

1062
01:44:56,123 --> 01:45:00,585
Shh.

1063
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,253
Shut up.

1064
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,214
Shh.

1065
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:05,715
- Josh!
- Shut up!

1066
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:07,842
- All right.
- Stand up.

1067
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,387
Stand up.

1068
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,555
Now march.

1069
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:16,726
Come on, Sam.

1070
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:04,774
No!

1071
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,905
I'll fucking kill you!

1072
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:15,493
Get off!
Get off her!

1073
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:17,037
Get off of her!
Run, run!

1074
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:23,168
I've got the gun.

1075
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,965
- I've got the gun.
- Sam.

1076
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:32,469
I've got a gun!
I've got a gun.

1077
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,929
Come on, Sam. If you shoot me,
you're gonna have to cut me up.

1078
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,057
Sam, keep the gun on Bobby.

1079
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:39,934
You'll never do it, pussy.

1080
01:46:40,102 --> 01:46:41,269
- Come on, shoot me.
- Sam!

1081
01:46:41,437 --> 01:46:43,146
Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.

1082
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:44,731
- Shoot me!
- Keep the gun on Bobby.

1083
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,816
- Sam, I'm on your side.
- You'll never do it, pussy.

1084
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:48,818
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.
- I'm on your side.

1085
01:46:48,986 --> 01:46:50,945
- Shoot me!
- Give the gun to Adrien.

1086
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:53,573
- Sam, give me the gun.
- Sam, give the gun to Adrien.

1087
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:55,492
- Shoot me.
- Give the gun to Adrien.

1088
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:58,036
- What?
- Give the gun to Adrien.

1089
01:46:58,204 --> 01:47:00,163
- Okay, I'm on your side.
- Fucking shoot me.

1090
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:01,998
Damn it, I'm on your side.
Give me the gun.

1091
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:03,500
- Shoot me!
- Give me the gun, Sam.

1092
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,502
- Shoot me!
- Give it to Adrien!

1093
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:09,005
Sam!

1094
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:14,803
No! No!

1095
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:40,662
Fucking do him.
Fucking do him.

1096
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:43,039
Fucking do him. Huh?
Fucking do him.

1097
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:45,375
Come on, you fucking pussy.
Fucking do him.

1098
01:47:45,543 --> 01:47:47,669
You gonna puss out
on me now? Do it!

1099
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:50,630
Come on, cunt.
Fucking do it.

1100
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:54,551
Fucking do it.

1101
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:57,303
Do him.

1102
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,079
Come on.
Come on, buddy boy.

1103
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:25,206
Hey. Hey.

1104
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,432
Eva! Get me out of here!

1105
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,601
Get me out of here!

1106
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:15,066
Are you proud of yourself?

1107
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,934
Sam, come on.
That's gasoline.

1108
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,229
Eva!

1109
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:22,652
Eva! Eva!

1110
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:25,321
Open the fucking door!

1111
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:29,242
Eva, come on.
Open the fucking door!

1112
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:32,995
Eva! Eva!

1113
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,376
- Eva!
- Eva!

1114
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:51,055
- Eva!
- Eva!

1115
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:02,733
- They changed the numbers.
- What?

1116
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,610
They changed
the fucking combination.

1117
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:06,487
What's the new combination?

1118
01:53:09,158 --> 01:53:11,576
- What's the new combination?
