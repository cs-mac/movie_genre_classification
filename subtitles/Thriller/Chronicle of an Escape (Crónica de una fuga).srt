1
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,712
On March 24, 1976

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,379
the Argentine Armed Forces
organized a coup d'etat.

3
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,289
In 1985 the military,
who ruled for seven years,

4
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,919
were taken to court
for human rights violations:

5
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,863
the first such trial
in Latin America.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,598
This story is based on the testimony
of two of the victims.

7
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:18,342
Buenos Aires. November 23, 1977

8
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,605
The mimeograph guy lives there?

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,751
Yes.

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,081
Are you sure?

11
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,181
Yes.

12
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,283
Unit calling Attila.

13
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,194
Get on that side!
To the left, asshole!

14
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,223
Want me to hit you again, bitch?

15
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,159
No, please.

16
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,389
Where does your son live now?

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,526
I don't know. He didn't
give me the address.

18
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,592
You don't know where your son lives?

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,265
I don't know where he is.
He didn't leave an address.

20
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,176
How long has it been since you saw him?

21
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,508
He hardly ever comes here.

22
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,947
- How long?
- A long time.

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,942
Since he moved in
with school friends.

24
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,421
Lefties too? Who are they?

25
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,688
He moved out months ago,
after my husband died...

26
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:45,357
I don't know exactly. I don't know.

27
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,867
Try to remember.

28
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,172
You don't know
your son's a terrorist?

29
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,143
No. No no no.

30
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,678
Saying we screwed up?

31
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,843
No. I'm just saying
he is a normal person.

32
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,752
They're killers! They murder children!

33
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,280
Stop lying! Your son is dangerous.

34
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,952
A terrorist!

35
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,756
You keep arms here?

36
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,525
Arms? No.

37
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,592
Go on, look! Look!

38
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,660
- There's nothing!
- Nothing?

39
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,332
Keep looking!

40
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,244
- Let's start again?
- Please, no...

41
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,242
Check there's nothing out back.

42
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,721
Nice house!
They're loaded.

43
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,564
They didn't check here.

44
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,742
Look at this!

45
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,815
The people united...

46
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,964
Out in the midfield
you were a sitting duck!

47
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,467
You were on your own.

48
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,800
You need Ariel with you,

49
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,601
and Guille on the left wing.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,801
When you learn to pass the ball,

51
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:40,040
that's when you'll start scoring.

52
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,072
To see who's in control.

53
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,550
It's no good for anybody.

54
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,453
We're not team players.

55
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,116
That's the problem.

56
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,511
Move it!

57
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,149
You lied! Why did you tell me
there were no arms?

58
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,125
There aren't any arms!

59
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,025
Then what's this?

60
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,691
- Yes, this!
- That thing.

61
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,222
It's a piece of cloth.

62
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,564
It's a weapon.

63
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,398
I don't understand.

64
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,405
Mom!

65
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,710
What does my daughter
have to do with this?

66
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,442
Nothing.

67
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,184
I beg you!

68
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,354
You decide, lady.

69
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,066
Your daughter,

70
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,263
or your terrorist son.

71
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,541
Thanks.

72
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,964
Keep walking! Come on!

73
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,812
Is this really your friend's house?

74
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,337
Take a good look.

75
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,373
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

76
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,443
Don't waste my time.

77
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,545
Do you understand?

78
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,716
Which one?

79
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,783
- Which one?
- That one.

80
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,387
- That one?
- Take him.

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,263
Tell the cops to clear the area.

82
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,625
Move the truck.

83
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,009
Let's go.

84
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,557
What do you want?

85
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,321
What's the matter?

86
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,062
Look at the floor!

87
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,896
Eyes on the floor!

88
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,426
- Easy, please!
- Get your head down!

89
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,167
Take anything you want!

90
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,743
You won't see a thing.

91
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,941
Stop! What is this?

92
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,418
Claudio Tamburrini.

93
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,480
Look, Claudio.

94
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,118
We need to have a little chat.

95
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,927
Tell me everything.
Right away would be best.

96
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,661
The longer you hold out,
the worse it'll be.

97
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,861
You're coming with us.
We have to check you out.

98
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,134
I don't understand.
I can't tell you anything!

99
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,701
Ask me here. Are you cops?

100
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,245
So you play for Almagro?

101
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,887
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,823
What position?

103
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,019
The goalie, sir.

104
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,086
And you need a mimeograph?

105
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,825
I don't have
any mimeograph.

106
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,528
What's this about?

107
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,337
On your feet.

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,634
- You're a goalie?
- Yes.

109
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,612
Stop this then!

110
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,448
You don't have a mimeograph...

111
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,015
or about being a terrorist?

112
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,721
I'm not in any political party!

113
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,458
We'll see.

114
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,161
I need to let my mother know.
She'll worry.

115
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,865
Worry about yourself
and don't fuck about.

116
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,101
Where are you taking me?

117
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,805
Just for a drive.
We'll talk, that's all.

118
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,615
When will I get back?

119
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,277
Lie down!
Eyes on the floor!

120
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,488
Unit calling Attila. Come in.

121
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,129
Attila! Come in!

122
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,662
Attila here. Over.

123
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,602
Bird's in the cage.

124
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,473
Heading back to the nest.

125
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,909
Roger.

126
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,751
Get out!

127
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:08,326
CHRONICLE OF AN ESCAPE

128
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,352
No!

129
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,397
No!

130
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,290
DAY 1

131
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,427
No no no!

132
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,062
No!

133
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,539
You're making a mistake!

134
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,737
Please.
I have to tell my mom...

135
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,739
Shall we talk?

136
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,149
Yes, sir.

137
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,087
Who are your contacts?

138
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,731
I don't have any contacts, sir.

139
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,396
Why do you need a mimeograph?

140
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,708
I don't have a mimeo-

141
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,255
Shall we try again?

142
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,286
Who are your contacts?

143
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,819
I have no contacts.

144
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,900
Now it's your turn,
fucking lefties!

145
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,001
I'm coming for you.

146
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,343
And you'd better talk!

147
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,872
Anyone want to get out?

148
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,181
Who wants to talk?

149
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,281
You'll escape, right?

150
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,813
Sons of bitches!

151
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,238
Praying, Marito?

152
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,472
Hurry it up,
your turn next.

153
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,819
Water...

154
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,726
I want water.

155
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,961
God has abandoned them.

156
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,406
Where are we?

157
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,105
Were they hard on you?

158
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,306
You screamed a lot.

159
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,588
Straighten up.

160
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:04,330
I don't know anything.
They've got no evidence.

161
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,203
These are trials
sent by the Lord

162
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,807
to make us stronger.

163
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,811
DAY 3

164
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,695
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

165
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,634
- Have you had any water?
- No, sir.

166
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,636
Give him some.

167
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,717
Involved in heavy shit?

168
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,353
No, sir.
I'm a goalkeeper for Almagro.

169
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,289
Almagro,
your case is going nowhere.

170
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,396
What case?
What you're talking about?

171
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,838
If you don't talk,
we're stuck.

172
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,901
I've told you everything I know.
It's the truth.

173
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,572
Sure?

174
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,137
Think about it.

175
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,641
They found your flag
with the guerrilla slogan.

176
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,452
I have nothing to do
with guerrillas, sir.

177
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,290
I don't know what to tell you.
It wasn't me.

178
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,225
Do you want to freshen up?

179
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,765
Do you play water polo?

180
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,861
Come on!

181
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,496
Man overboard!

182
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,937
You don't know about the attack
or the mimeograph?

183
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,446
Hold him down.

184
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,443
What's your alias?

185
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,144
I don't have an alias.

186
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,551
We're going to kill you, asshole.

187
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,523
- When did you join the guerrillas?
- I didn't, I swear!

188
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,322
The meeting, an attack...
you know nothing?

189
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,028
Your friend disagrees.

190
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,200
What friend, sir?

191
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,005
Claudio, tell them the truth.

192
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,537
Your pal with the mimeograph.

193
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,072
You're with them,
and you're planning an attack.

194
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,950
We want to know
when and where.

195
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,980
I have no friend here, sir.
I don't know anybody here.

196
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,493
Anything to tell him, Tano?

197
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,018
Don't bother lying.
Tell them the mimeograph

198
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,325
was for you!

199
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,209
Tano?

200
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,841
I don't know any Tano!
Tano who?

201
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,485
Bring the other one,
see who's lying.

202
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,722
Kneel, fucker!

203
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,233
Tell them you're
in the movement.

204
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,538
You're Clara's brother.

205
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,842
I saw him twice in my life.
I don't know him.

206
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,906
I called him!

207
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,143
I have no phone, sir!

208
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,674
I have no phone!

209
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,750
He's lying!

210
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,653
You're lying, bastard!

211
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,126
Tell them you're with the group,
you know people.

212
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,856
Tell them you're-

213
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,164
I don't know him, sir.

214
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,766
Tell them about the attack.

215
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,295
What attack?
I'll kill you!

216
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,369
Did you call him there, Tano?

217
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,980
I don't know.
I don't remember.

218
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,179
- You rang, he answered?
- Yes.

219
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,520
He's lying, sir.
I have no phone.

220
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,150
You know it.

221
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,254
Leave him!

222
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,731
He hit me!

223
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,345
The asshole hit me!

224
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,450
Enough!

225
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,894
When did you move?
Think carefully.

226
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,897
I have no phone.

227
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,865
Answer my question!

228
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,131
I have no phone, sir. I swear.

229
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,473
Get Lucas to take him away.

230
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,671
They get scared and lie.

231
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,340
Come on, champ!

232
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,973
Got to treat 'em nice.

233
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,914
Leave him to me.

234
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,714
Nice friend, kid.

235
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,056
He was more scared than you.

236
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,863
Another go, Tano?

237
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,162
I've done nothing, sir.

238
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,227
Then you'll be out by Christmas.

239
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,564
Can I go home, sir?

240
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,975
In 20 days, ready for Christmas.

241
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,207
Hallowed be Thy name.

242
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,374
Thy kingdom come,

243
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,510
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in Heaven.

244
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,986
Give us this day our daily bread

245
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,286
and forgive our trespasses...

246
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,849
as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

247
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:39,159
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

248
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,443
Shut up, man.

249
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,518
Don't let rage win you over.

250
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,718
You must pass these tests.

251
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,958
Fuck off, you and Jesus Christ!

252
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,990
Do you know what day it is?

253
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,331
Wednesday, sir.

254
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,996
Get ready.

255
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,272
Let's go, Marito.

256
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,890
Everybody kneel straight!

257
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,918
Prayer positions!

258
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,562
Pray! Christmas is coming!

259
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,636
Louder!

260
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,669
God can't hear you!

261
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,889
You'll all talk!

262
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,260
Bunch of faggots!

263
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,613
DAY 31

264
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,433
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

265
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,499
Get up!

266
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,473
Come on. On your feet.

267
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,544
Put these on, Marito.

268
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,742
- What?
- Put your shoes on.

269
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,977
You're going home.

270
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,385
- Or do you want to stay here?
- I want to go home.

271
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,052
Hurry up, then. Straighten up.
You look like a bum.

272
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,894
- They're letting us go.
- Always have faith.

273
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,632
What a stupid face!
Hands out.

274
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,302
- You have family?
- A daughter.

275
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,811
I live with my parents...

276
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,814
They'll be happy to see you.

277
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,584
- Time to go home?
- Yes, sir.

278
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,680
Have to behave.

279
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,851
I'll drive by every night
to make sure you're home...

280
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,329
- And no lies. We're good people.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,695
- Say it again.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,030
No, idiot! Say we're good people.

283
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,695
You're good people.

284
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,226
You're good people.

285
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,761
Good!

286
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,706
- Is the ditch ready?
- Don't joke.

287
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,507
He'll shit in the car.

288
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,749
Turn around.

289
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,183
Thanks.

290
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,212
I have white sneakers.

291
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,350
Is he going home too?

292
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,988
But I can go barefoot.

293
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,657
And say we mistreated you?

294
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,099
We have to do things right.

295
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,126
It's the only way.

296
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,743
What for?

297
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,612
Where are you taking me?

298
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,243
You? Nowhere.

299
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,782
Think about it,
while we look for your sneakers.

300
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,820
Merry Christmas!

301
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,031
Your turkey awaits you.

302
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,797
It'll get tough.

303
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,566
You almost managed to trick me.

304
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,164
Walk!

305
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,140
Hello, girls. Get up.

306
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,983
Take your blindfold off.

307
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,825
Open your eyes, moron.

308
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,995
Merry Christmas, Almagro.

309
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,245
- Can I?
- Go ahead. That's why it's there.

310
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,144
Today, I'm a nice guy.

311
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,048
- Go on, eat.
- No, thanks.

312
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,383
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Lucas.

313
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,389
- Louder.
- Thank you, Lucas.

314
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,119
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

315
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,888
Merry Christmas.

316
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,925
The party's over.

317
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,765
This is your new roommate, girls.

318
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,867
Treat her nice.

319
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,380
Especially you, Tano.

320
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,713
Merry Christmas.

321
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,444
Shut up!

322
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,749
This piece of shit gave me up!

323
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:47,315
They'll beat us all.
Sort it out quietly.

324
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,292
Quiet. Okay?

325
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,817
Okay. Let go.

326
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,625
You too, Tano. Quiet.

327
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,258
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

328
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,782
They found your number
in my address book.

329
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,479
Why did you make up
the mimeograph story?

330
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,880
They beat me up really bad.

331
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,785
Did all sorts of things.

332
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,601
Claudio... I had no choice.

333
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,538
Why choose me?

334
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,139
I needed time.

335
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,008
Do you understand?

336
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,707
I needed time

337
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,241
for my comrades to get away.

338
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,713
So you'll have a revolution

339
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,590
by betraying those
who have done nothing?

340
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,390
Claudio,

341
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,761
when they see you're
not involved,

342
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,767
they'll let you go.

343
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,033
You just have to
hang in there a bit longer.

344
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,499
Tano...

345
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,172
they won't let me go.

346
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,184
You've killed me, Tano.

347
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,037
DAY 45

348
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,079
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

349
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,480
You are our prisoners,
we're here to guard you.

350
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:08,622
If you need the toilet,
knock on the door.

351
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,999
We take you out
and we bring you back.

352
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,301
Two meals a day
and we count you twice at night.

353
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,173
Is that clear?

354
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,074
Yes, sir.

355
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,171
Obey us, you'll be okay.

356
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,114
Don't make life complicated.

357
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,682
And we share the housework.
Questions?

358
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,780
No, sir.

359
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,087
DAY 61

360
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,692
- Serve the food, Guillermo.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,228
Sir?

362
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,825
What is it?

363
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,499
Could you bring us cutlery?

364
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,270
At least a spoon, sir.

365
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,685
What's wrong with you?

366
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,357
You need a spoon, asshole?

367
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,560
They'll beat us.

368
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,831
Think this is a hotel?

369
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,832
Don't make demands here.

370
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,762
Vasco!

371
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,139
Vasco! Vasco!

372
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,170
Not eating?

373
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,547
You want his food?

374
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,283
The guard will take it.

375
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,593
If he won't eat,
we'll take his.

376
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,289
Let him starve.

377
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,835
Then it's my turn,

378
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,337
then his...

379
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,805
That it, Gallego?

380
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,977
Come on. What a welcome!

381
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,606
The German's here!

382
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,680
Everybody look down.

383
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,686
Eyes on the floor!

384
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,781
You have visitors.

385
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:57,386
Tomorrow we'll come for you.
Think of what to say.

386
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,692
Do you understand?

387
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,733
Can I go to the toilet?

388
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,499
Don't be so blunt, you shit!

389
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,649
Jorge...

390
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,850
Take off your blindfold.
They're gone.

391
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,255
You're an asshole, Tano.

392
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,593
Why didn't you give up
your comrades?

393
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,070
Take him to the bathroom, Almagro.

394
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,807
Yes, sir.
Can I take off my blindfold?

395
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,677
- Where?
- Right there.

396
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,327
So Tano knows you too?

397
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,854
Yes.

398
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,662
Yes, but he says anything,
he's fried.

399
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,805
He told them about papers
he ordered from me.

400
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,538
I printed them,
and they caught me.

401
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,672
You're the mimeograph guy!

402
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,679
They have to let me go.

403
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,916
- They'll let me go.
- Me too.

404
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,186
Tano's the one who's staying.

405
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,594
I told them
you're not involved in it.

406
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,031
It's all clear now.

407
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,728
They need you to give
them names.

408
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,464
Something.

409
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,272
But I have nothing to give them.

410
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,904
They don't buy it.

411
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,176
You must give them someone.

412
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,148
Don't you know anybody?

413
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,679
Someone from school...
someone really involved.

414
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,959
I don't know anyone
from school.

415
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,463
And in here?

416
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,828
You need to wake up.

417
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:24,068
Start looking around you.

418
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,803
Listen out.

419
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:31,037
Besides, it's not us.
It's the revolutionaries.

420
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,511
It's them they're after.

421
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,152
DAY 72

422
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,273
You're going to prison, Tano.

423
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,646
- I'm leaving?
- Yes, put your shoes on.

424
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,488
Easy, Tano. There's no rush.

425
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,455
This is the first
case we've solved.

426
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,087
In a few days

427
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,293
the situation
will be clarified for you all.

428
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,465
Let's go, Tano.

429
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,610
But you must continue
to help us.

430
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,250
For some of you...

431
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,693
we don't have enough.

432
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,861
You know what we want.

433
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,233
Information: names,
addresses, phone numbers.

434
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,979
They took him to prison.

435
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,511
Good.

436
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,849
We'll be legal prisoners now.

437
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,553
They'll bust me in jail.

438
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:31,930
When they find out
my brother's a rebel...

439
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,531
they won't leave me alone.

440
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:39,939
They'll kill me.

441
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:44,141
Why would they?
You're a nobody.

442
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,706
Sorry, Guillermo.

443
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,678
I should've taken the pill.

444
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,150
My brother warned me.

445
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:02,665
Knock it off. They'll beat us.
Easy, Vasco.

446
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,725
My brother knew.

447
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,237
They're incompetent,
don't you see?

448
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,296
Easy.

449
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,706
Sorry.

450
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,232
I'm sorry.

451
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,669
I'm fine now.

452
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,725
So you knew him?

453
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,535
He squealed on me.

454
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,972
He did?

455
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,442
Vasco turned you in?

456
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,311
- What do you mean?
- He just let something slip.

457
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,947
They tortured him, he gave
my name and address.

458
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,187
Of course.

459
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,458
That's why you took
such good care of him.

460
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,523
Because he turned you in.

461
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,238
I should've taken care of Tano.

462
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:21,506
Easy. Just some medicine
for the trip home.

463
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,382
Is he ready?

464
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,647
Single file!

465
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,892
Single file!

466
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,157
Let's go!

467
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,429
Come on, kid!
Move it.

468
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,493
Easy, I said!

469
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,739
Let's go back in.

470
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,188
DAY 118

471
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,826
Eyes down!

472
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,229
Eyes on the floor!

473
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,963
Put these on, Jorge.
You're going home.

474
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,369
Are you scared, faggots?

475
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,774
What are you waiting for?

476
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,245
You're all shit-scared?

477
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,084
Guillermo.
You're coming with me.

478
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,556
I have some questions for you.

479
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,896
What's going on?
I don't understand.

480
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,077
Wait here for me, Jorge.

481
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,751
Let's visit your mates,
see if they're where you said.

482
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,797
Jorge? Jorge?

483
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,662
What do you want?

484
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,168
My name is Guillermo Fernandez.

485
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,067
Please tell my family.

486
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,870
- I live in Moron.
- Shut it.

487
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,779
I don't help guerrillas.

488
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,007
So don't bust my balls, okay?

489
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,115
Come on, Jorge.
Mind the door.

490
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,284
You're going home,

491
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,351
but choose
your friends with care.

492
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:02,559
And don't print that bullshit.
It's bad for you.

493
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,397
We know you're a good guy.

494
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,631
Don't worry your parents.

495
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,047
Head down, motherfucker!

496
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,151
Hello, Guillermo.
Want to go for a ride?

497
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,568
Take his cuffs off.

498
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,437
Head down!

499
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,148
Recognize this house?

500
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,778
Yes.

501
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,812
Go ring the bell.

502
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,129
And mind what you do
or I'll blow your head off.

503
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,464
Look back and you're dead.
Got it?

504
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,663
Careful crossing the street.

505
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,140
I said go!

506
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,735
Guillermo Fernandez?

507
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,337
A smoke?

508
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,745
Yes please, sir.

509
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,510
Your hand.

510
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,725
Do we do a good job?

511
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,728
Yes.

512
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:29,102
Only I've heard rumors
you were saying we don't.

513
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,668
Explains why you're giving us
bad addresses.

514
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,270
Ones we already know.
Like this one.

515
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:40,147
Or those of friends
who've already fled the country?

516
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,047
You put on a great show, kid.

517
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:49,354
Even the guards
thought highly of you.

518
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,823
You lied to us, Guillermo.

519
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,425
You kept information from us.

520
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,059
No, sir. Please understand.

521
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,936
I didn't know what I was doing.
I panicked.

522
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,771
You bought time
to save your friends.

523
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,472
No, sir, I was scared. Really.

524
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:13,643
I didn't hide anything.
I was so confused.

525
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,015
Do you know who I am?

526
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,754
I'm the judge.

527
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,454
A judge?
Will you send me to prison?

528
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,902
I decide whether we kill you

529
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,200
or let you go.

530
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,332
Understand?

531
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,833
You haven't done
much to stay alive.

532
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,574
I swear it wasn't an operation.

533
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,048
I didn't know
what I was saying.

534
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,484
My head was a mess...

535
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,082
You've got three days
to put your ideas in order,

536
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,821
and come up
with real information.

537
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,692
Either you open your head
or we do it.

538
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,774
I told you.

539
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,116
It's worse for those
who hold back information.

540
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,917
But you don't listen.

541
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,992
You're stupid.

542
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,291
Now you're all punished.

543
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,833
You must cooperate.

544
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,137
Tell the truth.

545
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:52,879
When there's a lead
the investigation progresses.

546
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,511
The FBI started
in a house like this.

547
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,785
You have to
tell what you know.

548
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,821
Or you'll end up like Tano.

549
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,335
Underground.

550
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,159
Get undressed!

551
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,331
Hands out.

552
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,812
Undress! Are you deaf?

553
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,898
The blindfolds.

554
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,143
Look at yourself, Vasco.

555
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,580
That's you.

556
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,317
Recognize yourself?

557
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,480
You don't?

558
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,322
And you, Gallego...

559
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,792
Recognize yourself?

560
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,664
Nor will anyone else outside.

561
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,402
Now you must talk.

562
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,475
Look at that mug!

563
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,144
Aren't you ashamed?

564
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,316
You're repulsive.

565
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,122
Here.

566
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,630
You betrayed me, Guillermo.

567
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,162
I was handling your case.

568
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,074
You were getting out,
now look at you.

569
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,103
You played me.

570
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,513
But now I'll get you clean.

571
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,949
Disinfectant!

572
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:01,661
How can someone this young

573
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,640
be so rotten inside?

574
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,808
I'll make you shine.

575
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,657
Sir...

576
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,252
Sir!

577
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,692
You'll shine like new.

578
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,792
Shut up!

579
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,541
Don't forget.

580
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,570
Talk and you can still get out.

581
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,625
Guillermo!

582
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,864
Are you okay?

583
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,629
I've got to get out.

584
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,572
Really?

585
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,777
I'm going with you.

586
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,448
DAY 119

587
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,322
I'm hungry.

588
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,930
Plenty of restaurants
on the outside.

589
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,330
We'll be out soon.

590
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,326
Have to hang on.

591
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,168
Gallego...

592
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,508
Still think they'll let you go?

593
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:52,675
- You'll end up like Tano.
- Nothing happened to Tano.

594
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,779
Lucas just wants to scare us.

595
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,450
Why else say we'd go to prison?

596
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,425
They killed Tano.

597
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,485
How do you know
they killed him?

598
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,464
And Jorge?

599
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,763
Jorge was never with us.

600
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,801
Your case is closed, Gallego.

601
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,002
All our cases are closed.

602
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,170
We have to escape.

603
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,580
How do you suggest?

604
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,609
We must think like we did outside.

605
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,452
It's easier than it seems.

606
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,701
And you, goalie...

607
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,535
get dressed!

608
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,440
Think you can just lounge around?

609
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,034
Dirty bums!

610
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,345
Blindfold off,
pants on.

611
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,664
Here.

612
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,468
Have the scraps.

613
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,679
Thank you, Lucas.

614
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,685
Goal!

615
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,993
Come on, Argentina!

616
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,600
Argentina! Argentina! Argentina!

617
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,070
Argentina! Argentina!

618
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,800
Argentina!

619
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,979
Were Lucas' scraps tasty?

620
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,895
You want me to reject food?

621
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:08,026
Don't pretend. You're not tough.

622
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,436
You're nobody.

623
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,498
You left me alone.

624
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,407
Why didn't you do it?

625
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,915
What were you scared of, Gallego?

626
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,975
- We're all scared here.
- I wasn't scared.

627
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,386
This lunatic wanted
to hit Rivas with the pan.

628
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,788
- You held the weapon.
- It was there.

629
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:32,022
If it went wrong,
we'd all have paid.

630
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,427
I'm not going to kill anyone.

631
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,560
- You're terrified, Gallego.
- You can't talk.

632
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,399
Acted like Lucas' pal,
now look at you!

633
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,110
I want to get out alive.

634
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,915
My way.

635
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,052
DAY 120

636
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,102
How do you take them off?

637
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,471
I've got a plan.

638
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,100
A plan?

639
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,875
Fuck off.

640
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,749
- What's that?
- A screw.

641
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,720
- What for?
- To open the window.

642
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,484
I know they open,
I've cleaned them.

643
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,458
Then what?

644
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,289
Climb out using blankets.

645
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,785
They're too worn.
They won't hold.

646
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,130
We'll tie them with the straps.
They'll hold.

647
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,068
And then?

648
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,695
We'll be out.

649
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,798
On the outside.
We go out stark naked, right?

650
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,004
Nice plan! Great!

651
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,036
You'd rather tunnel out
with a spoon?

652
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,539
And when we're outside?

653
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,044
Know what you'll find
when you open the window?

654
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,368
Get up!

655
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,499
Get up! Let's go!

656
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,354
Attention!

657
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,753
Attention!

658
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,732
Quiet! Quiet!

659
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:10,174
You think you're cool
because you went to college?

660
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,777
No, sir.

661
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,387
They teach you
to handle guns there?

662
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,017
No, sir.

663
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,495
You'd like to escape, right?

664
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,742
You'd all like to escape.

665
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,982
You're guilty.
That's how it is.

666
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,617
I know that's how it is.

667
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,030
We'll kill whoever
wants to escape.

668
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,528
Start thinking
about your last request.

669
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,604
Let's see.

670
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,185
How about you, Gallego?

671
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,382
What's your last request?

672
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,818
I want...

673
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:31,293
I'd like to call home.

674
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,405
And you, Guillermo?

675
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,947
What do you want?

676
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,018
Will you grant it?

677
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,659
We are men of honor.

678
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,687
We are not filthy liars.

679
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,701
Of course we will.
I'm listening.

680
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:11,733
If you're going to kill me,
I want to see your faces.

681
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,569
Tie them up!

682
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,165
Get up!

683
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,114
You're killing prisoners
without telling me?

684
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,656
You guards are to blame.

685
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:12,031
You spoil these bitches rotten.

686
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:17,533
No, Hugo.
I make good use of them.

687
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,498
Think.

688
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,502
The more you mistreat them,
the less they talk?

689
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,546
Then it's you who's rotten.

690
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,453
Do you feel pity for them?

691
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,656
You do your job. I'll do mine.

692
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,626
Less than one day left.

693
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,127
You're real scum!

694
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:23,098
Treat you well
and you pay me back like this.

695
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,841
That was the last time,
Guillermo.

696
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,071
Good night.

697
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,298
Why do you play tough?

698
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,295
Want to get killed?

699
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:59,899
- They heard us.
- They didn't hear anything.

700
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,835
I want to finish it all.

701
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,506
We're already dead.

702
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,510
We're dead.

703
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,019
I won't be here
when they come for me.

704
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,557
We're disappearing.

705
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,959
Gallego!

706
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,661
You're disappearing!

707
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,373
DAY 121
March 24, 1978

708
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,661
Claudio!

709
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,228
What is it?

710
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:09,774
It has to be today.
Tomorrow I'll be dead.

711
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,372
Tucumano and Lucas are out.

712
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,110
They're the most unpredictable.

713
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,813
These guys are very methodical.

714
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,785
They've fed us.

715
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,453
Now they count us
and clear the dishes.

716
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,189
They count us again at dawn.

717
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,926
Just before sunrise.

718
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,729
That gives us three hours.

719
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,967
Tonight?

720
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,408
Let's pray.

721
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,792
What's up?

722
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,536
What are you doing?

723
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,177
Go back to sleep.

724
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:28,843
Shut up!

725
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,112
Do what I tell you.

726
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:34,054
It's decided, Gallego.
Don't bust my balls. Shut up.

727
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,055
Untie Vasco.

728
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,002
This is wrong.

729
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,245
- Watch the door.
- I don't want to.

730
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,989
You have no right.
You have no right.

731
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,657
You have no right.

732
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,343
Come on! Come on!

733
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,413
What are you doing, Vasco?

734
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,148
Go see what he's doing.

735
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,516
Come on, Gallego.

736
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,695
Come on, Gallego.

737
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,840
Thank you.

738
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,052
Over there, Vasco. Stay there!

739
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,556
Where's Guillermo?

740
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:37,457
- Why isn't he coming?
- I don't know.

741
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,653
THANK YOU LUCAS

742
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,326
Grab his feet.

743
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,309
Give me your hand.

744
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,344
Easy... Easy.

745
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,855
Give me your hand.

746
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,425
Come on!

747
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:02,002
Go on.
You can do it.

748
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,895
Stop!

749
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,398
Good evening.

750
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,017
Run, Vasco!

751
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,696
They're coming!

752
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,946
It's okay, Vasco.
It's over.

753
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,256
- Let's go.
- I can hear them.

754
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:21,091
- It's them.
- No. There's no one.

755
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,525
Calm down.

756
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,629
We'll stay here.
We're not moving.

757
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,721
Gallego.
You're too exposed.

758
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,858
There's some tools.

759
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,130
Take off my handcuffs.

760
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,070
Push hard.

761
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,846
I'll get them off, then I'm gone.

762
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,407
What's that?

763
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:22,522
- We have to split up.
- No! Wait!

764
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,458
Calm down.

765
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:28,553
We'll wait for the others

766
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:31,064
and decide together.

767
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:35,629
We'll wait.

768
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,546
Call my house.

769
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,485
Tell them I'm here.

770
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,932
You remember the number?

771
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:11,171
Don't move, okay?

772
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:13,765
Don't move.

773
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,049
It's them!

774
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,487
They're coming!

775
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:35,322
Calm down!

776
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,092
It's over.

777
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,428
We're going now.

778
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,904
Where are we going?

779
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,603
We'll take a train
and that's it.

780
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,445
No, it's not.
I can still hear them.

781
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,144
Listen.

782
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:06,854
Calm down.

783
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,884
Guille!

784
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,821
Don't worry.

785
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,654
Where is he?
Guillermo!

786
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,435
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

787
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,208
Excuse me, madam.

788
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,216
I've been mugged.

789
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,686
I was with my girlfriend.
They stole everything.

790
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,278
Can you help me?

791
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,812
Adela?

792
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,380
What is it?

793
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,325
Nothin, mother. It's okay.

794
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,850
Help me, madam.

795
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,584
It's all I've got.

796
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,953
- For a cab.
- Thanks very much.

797
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,391
Now go.

798
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:10,283
Stop!

799
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:35,841
Where is he?

800
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,208
Shut up!

801
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,778
Is something wrong?

802
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:51,455
He went to get help,

803
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:52,982
so somebody will come.

804
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:55,086
Who is he asking for help?

805
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,063
- It doesn't matter.
- What?

806
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,828
You don't know him.

807
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,028
He went to ask a neighbor.

808
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,665
- He asked for clothes.
- He said we should stay here?

809
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:08,574
Did you take the cuffs off?

810
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,169
Come here.

811
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,908
Stay here and stand guard.

812
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,314
I'll get your cuffs off.

813
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,114
There's a hammer.

814
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,456
Look, clothes.

815
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,187
How long do we have to wait?

816
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:33,928
The sun's coming up.

817
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,462
I've been robbed.
I need to get home.

818
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,196
Can anyone take me?

819
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:11,171
I have money.

820
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:15,834
I'll take you.

821
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:24,746
Are you a mechanic?

822
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,219
No, why?

823
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,188
That screw in your mouth.

824
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,560
What happened to you?

825
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:39,122
I was attacked.

826
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:43,194
It's dangerous alone at night.

827
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:45,171
Especially at your age.

828
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,800
There was a whole gang.

829
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,778
Cowards always go in gangs.

830
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,579
That's true.

831
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:26,736
Hold it! Quiet.

832
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:29,716
Shut up!
Get these off and we'll go.

833
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,878
But it's daylight!
We can't go now.

834
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,684
Shut up and let me do it!

835
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:39,826
Done.

836
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:43,262
Listen. I can hear a car.

837
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:44,958
Quiet.

838
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,597
It's them!

839
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,536
It's the squad!

840
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,460
That's my dad's car!

841
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:26,297
Carlos.

842
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,441
Look what they did to me.

843
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,442
Son?

844
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:41,284
What happened to you?

845
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,584
Where have you been?

846
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:46,718
How did you find me?

847
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:49,696
A guy named Guillermo called...

848
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,290
Get us out of here.

849
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,665
I was kidnapped.

850
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:57,398
Get us out of here, I beg you!

851
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:00,100
Go to the car!

852
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:01,608
I don't know you.

853
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:05,237
- They're coming with me.
- What?

854
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,410
In the trunk.

855
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,709
Get in the truck.

856
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:16,983
Thanks.

857
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,651
Get in.

858
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:34,238
We've been looking everywhere.

859
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:39,474
The house was chaos.
I stopped going to work.

860
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,750
They're killing people, Dad.

861
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:48,277
Torturing people.

862
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:53,722
Politics is dirty.
You know that.

863
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:02,001
How did you get out?
Who is Guillermo?

864
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:06,833
He's my friend.

865
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:09,207
A friend!

866
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:13,573
Who got you out of that?

867
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:16,549
A real good friend!

868
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:22,747
He helped me escape.

869
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:26,249
Escape?

870
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,921
You're crazy! You escaped?

871
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:32,857
They'll come after you.

872
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,130
They'll come after us.

873
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,974
You say they torture and kill,

874
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:45,808
but nothing will
happen to your family.

875
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:48,576
Be quiet, Vasco.

876
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:50,550
Trust me.

877
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:54,384
It's Gallego's dad.

878
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,190
We're getting out.

879
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,468
Come on!

880
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:09,922
Good morning.

881
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:30,213
Guillermo Fernandez fled to France
where he now acts.

882
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:32,776
In 1984, he met Claudio in Italy,

883
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:36,256
and the same year,
he met Gallego in Spain.

884
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:40,249
In 1985, he testified at the trials
of the military dictatorship.

885
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:57,468
Vasco sought refuge with a relative.

886
01:36:57,511 --> 01:37:02,210
He was kidnapped again
and set free in 1983.

887
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:06,982
In 1985, he testified at the trials
of the military dictatorship.

888
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:16,528
Gallego left Argentina
with his family's help.

889
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:21,433
He was last known to be
living in Spain.

890
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:25,427
He never returned to Argentina.

891
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:35,579
Following the escape
on March 31, 1978,

892
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:39,279
the remaining prisoners
were moved to regular jails

893
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,117
and later set free.

894
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:42,850
The mansion was torched,

895
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,482
eliminating all evidence.

896
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:53,228
Located at 48 Blas Parera Street
in Moron, Province of Buenos Aires,

897
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:58,796
Sere Mansion (Attila) functioned
as a detention camp

898
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:03,833
for the military junta
between 1976 and 1978.

899
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:27,156
Claudio claimed
political asylum in Sweden,

900
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,829
where he played
amateur soccer.

901
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,703
A researcher in philosophy
at Goteborg University,

902
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,538
in 1985, he testified at the trials
of the military dictatorship.

903
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:07,667
THE END
