00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:20,970
And you are...who am I?

118
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,064
There's a reason why you're here.

119
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,327
A reason I'm here for.

120
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,570
So?

121
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,599
<i>Everything is somehow connected.</i>

122
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,810
<i>Everything that has a beginning has an end.</i>

123
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,252
<i>It's a mix of everything</i>

124
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:42,956
<i>And I'm in the middle.</i>

125
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,949
<i>I always wanted to be a superhero</i>

126
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,238
<i>with a superpower</i>

127
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,015
<i>I wanted to do things that nobody thought possible.</i>

128
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:58,700
<i>In reality I already had a superpower</i>

129
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,830
<i>I was invisible.</i>

130
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,661
<i>And I also had a superhero costume.</i>

131
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,706
Paradise Pizza : the end of the rainbow

132
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,880
<i>Every superhero needs a tragic family story:</i>

133
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,580
<i>Spiderman's parents</i>

134
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,818
Dead.

135
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:12,201
<i>Batman's parents</i>

136
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:13,439
<i>Killed.</i>

137
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:14,938
<i>Superman's parents</i>

138
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:16,377
<i>Exploded.</i>

139
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,706
<i>I actually had the best requirements</i>

140
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,813
<i>My dad ran away to France when I was born.</i>

141
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,563
<i>I've never met him.</i>

142
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,089
<i>A similarity that I share with my grandma.</i>

143
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,068
<i>Her father died in the Second World War</i>

144
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,610
<i>The only memory she has from him</i>

145
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,204
<i>are three bullet casings his comrade
brought from foreign countries</i>

146
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,411
<i>My mom took her own life when I was 8</i>

147
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:52,082
<i>The best material for a hero story.</i>

148
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:55,281
<i>My grandma took care of me</i>

149
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,835
<i>and later I took care of her.</i>

150
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,220
I'm not a psychologist.

151
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,719
I don't care about your dreams.

152
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,957
What do you know about CLAY?

153
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,428
About your alliance with the Fr13nds?

154
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,389
Everything you want to know.

155
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,207
<i>But every detail is important.</i>

156
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:26,886
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

157
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,848
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

158
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,914
<i>Since I was 14 I spent my time in front of the PC.</i>

159
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,953
<i>I learned programming languages</i>

160
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,693
<i>Hacked my first system.</i>

161
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,926
<i>A universe of infinite possibilities.</i>

162
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:48,233
<i>For the first time I felt like I was good at something.</i>

163
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,706
<i>In real life I was a zero among ones.</i>

164
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
<i>An outsider.</i>

165
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:52,947
<i>A loser.</i>

166
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:53,999
<i>A freak.</i>

167
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,452
<i>But on the Internet I felt a sense of belonging.</i>

168
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,822
<i>A refuge for people like me.</i>

169
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,626
<i>Everyone who wasted their time on the World-Wide-Web</i>

170
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:10,860
<i>met here in the so-called "darknet"</i>

171
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,699
<i>The Internet within the Internet</i>

172
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,097
<i>Here I could be whoever I wanted.</i>

173
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,488
<i>I spent days and nights on the PC.</i>

174
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,384
<i>Then I slept in the real world.</i>

175
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,560
<i>But there was an antidote</i>

176
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:27,126
I got the idea from my biggest idol.

177
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:30,284
<i>There are a lot of great hackers out there.</i>

178
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,633
<i>There was only one true hero for me</i>

179
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,949
<i>He called himself "MRX"</i>

180
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,013
<i>He is from nowhere</i>

181
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,872
<i>No one knew who he was.</i>

182
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:40,671
<i>He could hack into any system.</i>

183
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,840
<i>He was a real star</i>

184
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,798
<i>One of his most famous hacks
was a social network attack</i>

185
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,492
<i>He didn't take anything or anyone seriously.</i>

186
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,882
<i>He was the superhero among all hackers.</i>

187
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,562
<i>I wanted to be like him.</i>

188
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,915
<i>He had an exploit used to manipulate an online pharmacy</i>

189
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,212
<i>to get Ritalin</i>

190
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,876
<i>The hacker's watchman</i>

191
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,238
MRX had 3 rules:

192
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,982
3rd: Have fun in cyberspace and meatspace

193
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:16,408
In other words, don't limit your fun, don't
enjoy things only in the virtual world

194
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,182
<i>But the real reason I sit here now</i>

195
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,137
<i>why everything happened this way</i>

196
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,156
<i>is Marie.</i>

197
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,873
Hey! Just resting hasn't helped anyone so far.

198
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,850
Hope is the rainbow over the waterfall of our life.

199
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,967
Do you still want to pass the exam?

200
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,402
Try with learning!

201
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:37,018
Or do you hope someone will steal
the exam questions for you?

202
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:39,561
I called Superman but he had no time.

203
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:43,217
Retard!

204
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,299
What kind of weirdo bird are you?

205
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Paradise Pizza

206
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:49,138
The end of the rain-...

207
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,338
-bow.

208
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:54,747
<i>During the school time I was
desperately in love with Marie.</i>

209
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,610
<i>But after ten years no one still
remembers the freak from the last row.</i>

210
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,561
That'll be 34.28

211
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,912
I said without anchovy

212
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:15,308
I'm not paying for this!

213
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,142
Don't be an ass, Oscar!

214
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,643
The rest is for you.

215
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,379
What? Are you crazy?

216
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:24,125
Mr. Anchovy gives you a hundred
more if you get the exam questions.

217
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,240
Bachelor of Laws

218
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,754
The world doesn't need a savior

219
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,856
but everyday I hear people crying for one.

220
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,797
What?

221
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,549
That's Superman

222
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,483
It's okay.

223
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:44,706
Thanks.

224
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,734
You're such a jerk!

225
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:52,760
<i>I finally wanted to be a superhero.</i>

226
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,403
<i>Marie had a problem</i>

227
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,930
<i>and I could solve it.</i>

228
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,963
<i>I just had to get her the exam questions.</i>

229
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:00,228
<i>She'll remember me.</i>

230
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,233
<i>We'll fall in love</i>

231
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,220
<i>get married</i>

232
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,064
<i>have kids</i>

233
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:03,834
<i>be happy together</i>

234
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,034
<i>Bingo.</i>

235
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:16,303
<i>The bachelor exam questions were stored on
the central server of the university</i>

236
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,957
<i>All I needed was access.</i>

237
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,229
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

238
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,419
<i>Most of the hackers only pass through</i>

239
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,795
<i>They appear in the system without changing a thing</i>

240
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,372
<i>Others leave a hint</i>

241
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,411
<i>and many take a souvenir.</i>

242
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,837
<i>I was Superman, Spiderman, Batman</i>

243
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:48,188
What are you doing there?

244
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,365
<i>I was an idiot.</i>

245
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,264
No entries, no previous conviction

246
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,975
50 hours of community service

247
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,106
Do something with your life!

248
00:08:58,313 --> 00:08:59,313
It's up to you!

249
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:13,538
<i>My 50 hours of community service meant
cleaning a city I didn't care about</i>

250
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,063
<i>It couldn't be any worse.</i>

251
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,372
<i>Not even the ritalin worked anymore.</i>

252
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,739
<i>But everything had to change in one fell swoop.</i>

253
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,779
And? why are you here?

254
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,335
Can't you speak or what?

255
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:52,611
Then no.

256
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:56,332
Let me guess...

257
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,101
you're one of those guys who
thinks life's unfair for them

258
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,113
who feels like only passing by

259
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:02,147
invisible

260
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,236
just as the rest of society

261
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,910
In school you weren't even beaten up

262
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,368
because nobody gave a damn about you

263
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,482
That's all really really sad.

264
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:11,413
Do you know what I think?

265
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:13,302
it's all just a scam.

266
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,037
Computer stuff.

267
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:23,244
And you?

268
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,322
This and that

269
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:32,679
What kind of things? huh?

270
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:33,746
DDoS attacks?

271
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:34,827
Botnets?

272
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:35,962
Phishing?

273
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,806
Or are you just a script kiddie?

274
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,827
I hacked the University's server.

275
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:43,274
How did you manage to gain access?

276
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,502
Using a 0Day Exploit.

277
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,105
You know how to read machine language?

278
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,204
Simply as that?

279
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:50,284
Mhm

280
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:56,245
I am Max.

281
00:10:58,771 --> 00:10:59,771
Benjamin.

282
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,239
Any plans for today?

283
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:08,067
<i>I keep wondering if there's a moment
that pulls all strings together</i>

284
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,734
<i>That moment which changes everything</i>

285
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,967
The later the evening gets, the
more drunk the guests become

286
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,366
How do you like my modest temple?

287
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:12,531
I don't even know half of these people.

288
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,708
All shit suckers!

289
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,002
<i>Max was the total opposite of me</i>

290
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,046
Self-confident, charismatic

291
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,238
A winner

292
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,950
Close the door!

293
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:33,516
Let me introduce you

294
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,556
This is Benjamin.

295
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,687
Stefan

296
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:46,684
Benjamin

297
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,148
Benjamin Engel.

298
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,625
<i>Stefan was the software master</i>

299
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,829
<i>He could find a bug in any application</i>

300
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,230
<i>He's always been completely insane.</i>

301
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,271
<i>He loved the thrill</i>

302
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,200
craziness

303
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,211
and so on

304
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:01,963
No last name.

305
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,897
<i>Paul was the hardware freak</i>

306
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,851
<i>Give him a paper clip and a motherboard
and he'll build anything you want.</i>

307
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,279
<i>Like me, he lost his mother early.</i>

308
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,053
<i>His rich father left him at an orphanage</i>

309
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,782
<i>so he could focus on the important things.</i>

310
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,857
Don't worry! His smile muscles were removed at birth.

311
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,671
Max said that you can read machine language

312
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,436
Machine language?

313
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:22,536
Anyone can say that!

314
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,446
It's not something that's easy to prove!

315
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,501
Prove it!

316
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,001
Or you won't leave alive.

317
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,970
Angel

318
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,625
Paul

319
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,688
Benjamin

320
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,303
Just Benjamin

321
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,049
The fun begins now!

322
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,229
Don't worry!

323
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,065
We're not the swindlers

324
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:37,201
What? Did you think that I live here?

325
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:38,736
Come on!

326
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:46,603
Come on! Go!

327
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:53,986
Make way!

328
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,250
You're the pizza bird!

329
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,004
Do you know each other?

330
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,005
It's his party!

331
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:12,324
What the fuck?

332
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:33,935
No last name.

333
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,330
I always stopped at warnings

334
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,469
never asked myself again after that

335
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,014
I can't anymore

336
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:48,482
I can't go any further

337
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:52,287
See ya after!

338
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,162
Now I remember you!

339
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,511
Benjamin! Benjamin Engel!

340
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:06,107
Our teacher forgot about you

341
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:09,653
and then you had to take the train back home!

342
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,362
It was interesting...

343
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:17,915
..the evening

344
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,875
Bye!

345
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:24,638
Bye.

346
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,787
We all knew that this day will come.

347
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,969
Your grandma needs professional help.

348
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:29,884
You must let go!

349
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,176
She's on really good hands.

350
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:45,616
<i>My grandma was diagnosticated
with Alzheimer 4 years ago.</i>

351
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:50,239
<i>Since then it's like an invisible
eraser deletes her borders.</i>

352
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,305
Tickets, please!

353
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,417
I thought the cops have caught you!

354
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:25,337
It wasn't a good idea in the very
first week to close the exit.

355
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,445
What's wrong?

356
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,344
You'll feel better.

357
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,903
Come on! I show you something!

358
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:48,884
Come on!

359
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,947
<i>I should have stayed there sitting</i>

360
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,957
<i>But it was like between us was an invisible rope.</i>

361
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,437
<i>He told me how he started with hacking</i>

362
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,490
<i>I was all ears.</i>

363
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,409
There are people out there, they think they're safe

364
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,228
They have no idea what's going on.

365
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,597
Security. Everyone wants security.

366
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,715
Security doesn't exist!

367
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,542
Once you understand this, you know

368
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:15,671
it's like you have the world served on a plate.

369
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,142
You only have to get it!

370
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,580
<i>Even though we were so different,
we had something in common.</i>

371
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:22,968
First: Don't enjoy your actions
only in the virtual world

372
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,176
Second: aim for the impossible

373
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:25,939
3rd: No system is safe

374
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:27,861
MRX!

375
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,208
Never hide behind your computer.

376
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:33,262
MRX already knows this.

377
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:36,938
The main vulnerability isn't in applications or servers

378
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,336
Man is the main security flaw.

379
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,544
You hack people?

380
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:40,731
Exactly.

381
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:44,916
The most effective of all hacking
methods, the great art of deceiving:

382
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,003
Social engineering

383
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,981
Man is by default trusting and confiding

384
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:54,428
Social engineering uses these two components

385
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:55,737
so that you can get anything you want:

386
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,670
Passwords, secret information, login data

387
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:02,936
Hungry?

388
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:12,004
Hold this!

389
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:29,935
How many chocodonuts do I get for this?

390
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,133
It's a new sales pitch? huh?

391
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,188
Pay for 10, get 8!

392
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,821
For those with chocolate it wasn't available.

393
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,780
What would I stand here for?

394
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,332
Who required this?

395
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,999
That blonde from there!

396
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:51,487
Come on! I'm hungry and got things to do!

397
00:20:58,965 --> 00:20:59,865
There you go!

398
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:00,879
Have a good evening!

399
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,565
All good!

400
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,729
You must be bold enough!

401
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:10,380
Then the world is at your feet

402
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:12,790
Oh! Already late!

403
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:14,255
Are you ready?

404
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:15,728
Come on let's go.

405
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:16,798
But...

406
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,468
Where are we going?

407
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,613
Come on!

408
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,803
Go!

409
00:21:58,507 --> 00:21:59,974
Why did you bring him?

410
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,702
You don't know if we can trust him!

411
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:05,921
You already saw what he can.

412
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:14,509
You can drive.

413
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:19,965
Don't make a big deal out of this! We'll bring it back!

414
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,335
Looking like this, you'll never get in!

415
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:43,598
Why does he come?

416
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:46,277
I thought I come with you!

417
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:47,104
What are you up to?

418
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,119
Not "you", "we" !

419
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,230
Come on! Get dressed!

420
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:51,375
Chop-chop!

421
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:53,223
This wasn't part of the plan!

422
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:58,923
Let's go!

423
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,673
Good luck!

424
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:05,857
Don't you come with us?

425
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:06,934
I'd rather not!

426
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,704
Let's go, my young boy!

427
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:23,123
<i>The identification card was a
small simple piece of paper</i>

428
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,126
<i>Five minutes of Photoshop</i>

429
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,009
<i>Two minutes for printing</i>

430
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,076
<i>Any idiot could do that.</i>

431
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:29,484
Identity card?

432
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:35,349
Without despatch!

433
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:38,039
Fellow of the Danish Federation.

434
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:39,419
Without

435
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:40,741
Without despatch.

436
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,735
One of the guest speakers!

437
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:44,719
Danish people's front!

438
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,620
What has this to do with hacking?

439
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,344
The presentation's laptop

440
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,101
must be connected to another wifi network

441
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,833
This is your job!

442
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:14,145
Don't forget! Aim for the impossible!

443
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:19,588
Shit! Shit!

444
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:20,745
Which?

445
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,341
What other network?

446
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,710
I don't trust the small one!

447
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:31,424
You don't trust anyone not even yourself!

448
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,810
Listen! They're sick of this!

449
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,376
The Federal Intelligence Service has people everywhere!

450
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:38,059
They're between us! OK?

451
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:41,166
They have this kid that never said a lie.

452
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,471
I'm invisible!

453
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:31,232
I'm invisible!

454
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:34,264
I'm invisible!

455
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,047
You assholes!

456
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,565
Time for a bit of blasphemy!

457
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:34,131
Dear fellows,

458
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:37,539
we're presenting you now our new wallspot!

459
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,502
A small flame that will burn in german's hearts!

460
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,012
Quiet!

461
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:15,531
Cut! Cut!

462
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,647
The lamers are coming!

463
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,015
Stefan! the keys!

464
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,021
I don't have them!

465
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,440
<i>That was our first action together</i>

466
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,018
<i>The birth of something real big.</i>

467
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,588
<i>And I was a part of it.</i>

468
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:10,438
How do I know that what you're telling me, is for real?

469
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:16,516
17-04-73 6212

470
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:19,072
What did you say?

471
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,041
Your insurance number.

472
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:22,689
Born in Friedrich

473
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,668
studies in Germany

474
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,586
Graduated as the best of the year

475
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,856
Investigator at the European Cybercrime Center in Hague

476
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Two bank accounts: one at Densk Bank

477
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:32,798
other at Holland Direct Bank

478
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:37,335
During the study period, you had a problem

479
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,859
Since then you couldn't have kids anymore.

480
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,121
Because of an uterus disease

481
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,919
Your colleagues consider you cold

482
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,432
I consider you lonely.

483
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:58,251
<i>We needed a place for hacking</i>

484
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,980
<i>My grandma's house was the perfect place.</i>

485
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:02,885
This reminds me of the old times.

486
00:29:02,902 --> 00:29:04,402
Having a computer crib or something.

487
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:08,660
1 million views!

488
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,221
We need a name!

489
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:17,063
We must become a brand! We must become famous!

490
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,291
All what attention generates is counterproductive.

491
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,441
We're staying off the radar.

492
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,367
Fuck the radar!

493
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,366
Brand is awesome!

494
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,758
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

495
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:26,435
Like MRX!

496
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:29,322
Are you all completely nuts?

497
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:33,177
<i>Max had an idea</i>

498
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:36,724
<i>If Max had an idea, nothing could stop him</i>

499
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,923
I no longer do this shit with you!

500
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:58,902
Take the surprise from chocolate!

501
00:29:58,966 --> 00:29:59,866
Take it!

502
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Sure! No problem!

503
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:02,203
I follow the polls!

504
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,230
Who is "for" ?

505
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,646
We still need a name.

506
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:12,463
How about "CLAY" ?

507
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:15,137
as in "Clowns laughing at you"

508
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:19,395
because it's all about fun and because of the mask

509
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:26,278
Nominated with 4 votes.

510
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:28,385
For CLAY

511
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,320
<i>CLAY's next move was a small
greeting to the financial world</i>

512
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:45,672
We had taken a liking to this.

513
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:47,624
Our next target was a big pharma company.

514
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:12,485
<i>Max was right</i>

515
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,739
<i>The bolder you were, the more you could achieve.</i>

516
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:17,106
<i>We hacked everything we got our hands on.</i>

517
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,168
<i>The ritalin kept us awake</i>

518
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:21,576
<i>We didn't take anything and anyone seriously.</i>

519
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,461
<i>Who hides behind this mask?</i>

520
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:57,805
<i>Is it a criminal organization</i>

521
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,995
<i>or just a group of rebel teenagers?</i>

522
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:23,678
Hi!

523
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,717
What are you doing?

524
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,470
Me? Nope.

525
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:30,237
You?

526
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,213
I'm looking for the man of the rainbow.

527
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:38,891
<i>Marie? Are you coming?</i>

528
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,246
We must stop meeting in secret!

529
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:46,627
and also leave our covers!

530
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:55,151
You're such a fiasco!

531
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,192
You...for you it's easy!

532
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:01,200
You're...you're different! people are listening to you!

533
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:02,271
You're cool!

534
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,116
Maybe you're right!

535
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,575
When life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.

536
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,040
<i>Max was marching on</i>

537
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,008
<i>but his mood could change in seconds.</i>

538
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:45,369
<i>For weeks he tried to get from
MRX a reaction about CLAY.</i>

539
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,474
<i>He wanted appreciation from his biggest idol</i>

540
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,636
We are fucking losers!

541
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,409
<i>But MRX didn't give a fuck about us</i>

542
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,661
<i>Abroad there was another player.</i>

543
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,775
<i>Around this time she entered the game.</i>

544
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:20,739
<i>Now I call on Hanne Lindberg, lead
cybercrime investigator of Europol</i>

545
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,447
<i>Yesterday night, was a cyberattack on
the European Central Bank of Frankfurt</i>

546
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,120
<i>We found out that the same hackers are involved</i>

547
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:35,675
<i>which are also behind the attacks
on the German Army's servers.</i>

548
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:37,961
<i>they call themselves "Fr13nds".</i>

549
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:43,254
Fr13nds is part of the Russian cyber mafia

550
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:46,822
They hacked as in the past years
many international targets.

551
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,371
The group has 4 nicknames to locate

552
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:49,595
3 of them are:

553
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,839
The last one is still unknown.

554
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:56,253
The data they got was sold on the so-called "darknet"

555
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:00,066
and consumed by the Russian cyber mafia.

556
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:01,836
According to our newest
investigations, at least one

557
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:03,362
of the Fr13nds members seems
to operate from Berlin.

558
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:05,786
Our commission joins the Europol investigations.

559
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,933
Nobody knows the Fr13nds and their past
actions better than Hanne Lindberg

560
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,107
Is it true that you're tracking the Fr13nds for 3 years

561
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,123
without success?

562
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:18,514
Yes!

563
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,472
OK. Any other questions?

564
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,395
Good.

565
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:27,116
Hanne!

566
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:32,407
I just wanted to say...

567
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:35,144
Glad to see you!

568
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:38,855
I hope you don't have any problems with this

569
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:39,936
No!

570
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:45,216
No. I'm glad to work with you!

571
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:47,575
Good.

572
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:51,463
One more thing...

573
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:56,864
The fact that we were together, no one must know it.

574
00:36:57,211 --> 00:37:00,278
People are talking. Must lose the information!

575
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:08,275
<i>While she was hunting the Fr13nds,
Max tried to get rid of the frustration caused by MRX.</i>

576
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:32,503
Wanna take a ride?

577
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,884
<i>Max and Stefan borrowed one of Paul's toys</i>

578
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,233
<i>and tampered the transmission line
of a radio's prize competition</i>

579
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:41,905
<i>They interrupted all the lines but one</i>

580
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:44,123
<i>so that Max could be put through.</i>

581
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,003
Hello!

582
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:47,362
My name is Benjamin Engel.

583
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:50,315
The correct answer is B: Ottmar Hitzfeld.

584
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:57,518
Are you crazy?

585
00:37:57,898 --> 00:37:59,698
What has this to do with CLAY?

586
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,127
What kind of fucking message
is behind stealing a Porsche?

587
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:03,872
It's not like that!

588
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:06,031
It's not like a shitty Renault!

589
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:09,339
Superheros need a superhero car!

590
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,375
Exactly!

591
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,804
Moreover it's not stolen, it's won!

592
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:15,546
Forget it!

593
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:48,868
Here!

594
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:21,296
Excuse me, girls!

595
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:23,889
We were a bit late!

596
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:47,600
These guys are like Windows: it
takes a while till they boot up.

597
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,195
Cheers!

598
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:54,296
You can be whoever you want!

599
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:56,406
Check this out!

600
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,199
Be open minded!

601
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:13,637
You achieved everything when you
completed your ultimate challenge

602
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:19,170
So can Benjamin, for example, he has a
huge potential, but he doesn't use it!

603
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:24,924
He hides behind the others. He doesn't open his mouth!

604
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:28,023
If someone must always pull you

605
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,243
then you'll never go far!

606
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:33,496
Most of the people can only follow rules!

607
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:47,080
It wasn't enough!

608
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:54,614
<i>Max was right. I had to finally change something</i>

609
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:47,109
I passed the exam!

610
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:52,351
What are you up to now?

611
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,782
Do you know how I made it?

612
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:58,113
Nope.

613
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,930
I've intentionally answered wrong the questions.

614
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,001
Why?

615
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:09,646
There are so many possibilities outside.

616
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,459
I had the feeling that is not carved
in stone that I pass the exam.

617
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,351
Like all the doors shut forever.

618
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:20,169
But now I've decided on a door.

619
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:28,081
Why are you driving a Porsche?

620
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,015
I'm the employee of the month.

621
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,245
Or maybe I'm also a superhero

622
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,890
and this is my superhero car

623
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:45,412
Yeah...maybe

624
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:51,478
<i>Come on! believe in yourself!</i>

625
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,065
<i>Be like Max</i>

626
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:57,155
<i>Aim for the impossible!</i>

627
00:44:08,977 --> 00:44:10,110
I'd better go out

628
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:21,278
It fits to Porsche

629
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,331
Oh look who's here!

630
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:45,869
The pizza bird!

631
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:54,169
Get your hands off Marie!

632
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:00,378
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

633
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,383
Everything's alright?

634
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:11,747
Don't ask.

635
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:16,468
MRX sent a message!

636
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:20,737
<i>MRX hasn't missed a single word about CLAY</i>

637
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:22,112
until this moment.

638
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,087
<i>In front of us we had the
confidential cybercrime</i>

639
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,377
<i>investigation document
they sent to Europol</i>

640
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,965
<i>It was a marked paragraph about CLAY</i>

641
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:43,791
<i>The packet's purpose was only one:</i>

642
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,179
<i>He wanted make this clear to us</i>

643
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,006
<i>CLAY in his eyes wasn't more</i>

644
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:48,063
<i>than whining babies.</i>

645
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:57,466
We'll finish the fucker!

646
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:59,006
Let's do an attack that tops all!

647
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:05,043
We could hack a big bank!

648
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,452
Yes! the money of a famous company!

649
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:08,563
Bullshit!

650
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:10,840
We need an attack on something real huge!

651
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,437
Something able to reach the Olympus!

652
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:15,312
The Federal Intelligence Service.

653
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:16,396
What?

654
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,630
BND!

655
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:21,586
The king class.

656
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:24,899
The German Secret Service.

657
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:28,265
Bullshit! It's unhackable!

658
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:29,357
No system is safe.

659
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,674
And aim for the impossible!

660
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:48,634
<i>The BND action must be the most complex we ever did.</i>

661
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:48,659
Here you go, you pussy!

662
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:50,003
<i>With the right bait</i>

663
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,964
<i>you can catch any fish.</i>

664
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,732
<i>Without knowing, Gerdi granted us access.</i>

665
00:48:09,935 --> 00:48:14,001
<i>But from her system we still
couldn't access the main server.</i>

666
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:16,472
<i>Gerdi was the jackpot, though.</i>

667
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:19,529
<i>Gerdi was responsible for the card cloning</i>

668
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:21,528
<i>and for distribution of the entry-cards to BND.</i>

669
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,045
Accepted by password or address?

670
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,001
<i>It was the all time biggest breaking cliché.</i>

671
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:27,856
Idiots!

672
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:35,503
<i>Many tried to hack the BND before.</i>

673
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:39,177
<i>But you can't do this only by hiding behind your desk.</i>

674
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,170
Ready?

675
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,155
Where's Benjamin?

676
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,691
No idea

677
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,295
Where have you been?

678
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:08,865
<i>We really made it.</i>

679
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:16,020
<i>That was the Olympus</i>

680
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:21,021
<i>We haven't just climbed it, we
also have put a flag on its peak.</i>

681
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:28,594
<i>As for BND, the employees will get the
next day the shock of their lives.</i>

682
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,028
<i>That was my night</i>

683
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:31,551
Leave me alone!

684
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:32,752
Let us in!

685
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:35,539
Don't act like a kid!

686
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:36,593
And you like an asshole!

687
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:38,879
You're nothing without us!

688
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:39,888
A nobody!

689
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:41,424
<i>It's enough</i>

690
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,620
Nobody.

691
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,770
Nobody

692
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,510
<i>Without the others knowing it</i>

693
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,219
<i>I stole secret data from BND server.</i>

694
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:51,451
First he has manipulated the printers over
the communication protocol

695
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,197
then he bypassed the security firewall

696
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:55,968
and stole data.

697
00:54:56,942 --> 00:54:58,342
Our unhackable system

698
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:00,943
has been hacked in 2 minutes 23

699
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,134
You're saying this like you were excited about it.

700
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:06,532
Whoever did this is a genius.

701
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,605
We should have had recordings

702
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:11,918
They deleted all the video files and left something.

703
00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:23,248
<i>But everything has a consequence</i>

704
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:25,261
<i>Every single fly flap.</i>

705
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,687
That was found about his body.

706
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,774
He was found in the woods.

707
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:35,827
Moritz Lauer, better known as Krypton.

708
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:49,209
Morning!

709
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:52,689
Get out!

710
00:55:56,268 --> 00:55:57,268
Get lost!

711
00:55:57,611 --> 00:55:59,311
What the fuck? you need us!

712
00:55:59,342 --> 00:56:00,142
What?

713
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:01,165
I need you?

714
00:56:01,382 --> 00:56:02,782
Or maybe you need me!

715
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,166
Do you know what?

716
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,972
You're nothing! you're nothing
more than a shitty impostor!

717
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:09,237
All you can do is using people and manipulate them!

718
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:20,419
Stop! Stop!

719
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:24,687
Be quiet!

720
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:25,708
Quiet!

721
00:56:26,825 --> 00:56:31,325
<i>This morning was found the dead body of the hacker
which has the pseudonym "Krypton"</i>

722
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:36,419
<i>His dead and the German Secret
Service hack of the last night</i>

723
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:41,991
confront the BND with something that might be
the biggest scandal of its history.

724
00:56:42,073 --> 00:56:45,973
<i>Near to the dead body, was
found the stolen data from BND</i>

725
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:49,011
<i>A secret employees list</i>

726
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,178
<i>proving that Krypton worked for the BND.</i>

727
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:57,339
<i>It seems that Krypton belongs
to the hackers group Fr13nds</i>

728
00:56:58,641 --> 00:57:02,374
<i>Financed by the BND to collect
information about hackers</i>

729
00:57:03,117 --> 00:57:10,350
<i>At this time, the hackers group CLAY
seems responsible for the BND breaking.</i>

730
00:57:13,023 --> 00:57:14,756
You were the only one in the server room!

731
00:57:14,787 --> 00:57:15,787
What have you done there?

732
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:20,032
We said that we don't touch anything,
take anything and turn on only the printers!

733
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,070
Did you leave any data?

734
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:27,458
I've found a hidden partition on the BND server

735
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:30,124
I have...I've cracked the password

736
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:33,152
and then downloaded some kind of employees list

737
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,201
I don't know...

738
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:35,727
I sent it to MRX.

739
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:36,797
Are you crazy?

740
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:38,661
I wanted to prove him!

741
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:40,448
I wanted to prove you!

742
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:41,456
You thought I'm a nobody!

743
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:48,903
<i>Sometimes we hold so tight a
photograph we got from someone.</i>

744
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,024
<i>It was like I couldn't recognize myself anymore.</i>

745
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:54,849
<i>Everyone sees what they want</i>

746
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,520
<i>Suddenly, it was crystal clear</i>

747
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,110
<i>MRX has sold the stolen data to the Russian cyber mafia</i>

748
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:11,232
MRX belongs to the Fr13nds

749
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,591
When he found out that Krypton worked
for the BND, he eliminated him!

750
00:58:15,603 --> 00:58:18,003
Now everyone thinks that we did it!

751
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:20,118
It's only his fault!

752
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:31,111
Austrian product.

753
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:35,569
Krypton has been admitted to the
government agency and was eliminated.

754
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:37,494
What has this to do with CLAY?

755
00:58:38,092 --> 00:58:39,092
I don't know.

756
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:45,707
We could fail.

757
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:49,698
I received a call from Hague.

758
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:52,508
They wanted me to make an evaluation

759
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,860
of you.

760
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,980
Your work

761
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:01,981
I didn't know that your chair isn't stable

762
00:59:02,029 --> 00:59:03,562
Why didn't you tell me?

763
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:25,009
Where are you going?

764
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,961
To find some fun. This isn't fun anymore!

765
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,902
Krypton is dead, Max, dead!

766
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:32,627
And we'll get fucking blamed for all this scandal!

767
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:34,559
Benjamin could hand himself over to the police

768
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:36,666
and tell them how he built alone his shit CLAY!

769
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:38,412
Do you want sacrifice one of us?

770
00:59:38,477 --> 00:59:40,477
You always wanted to run away!

771
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:42,233
I don't fuckin' care what you're doing, I'm out!

772
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:43,276
Stefan! Wait!

773
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:45,549
This is all my fault!

774
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:47,334
I must find MRX!

775
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:50,287
And then what?

776
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:51,966
It's not about us! it's about MRX

777
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:52,821
the Fr13nds

778
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:53,732
they are the target!

779
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,100
Benjamin is right. Running away doesn't solve this

780
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,585
There are so many tracks left there

781
00:59:58,004 --> 01:00:00,671
It's just a matter of time till they catch us!

782
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:03,628
We deliver them MRX and the Fr13nds
and we'll become invisible again.

783
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:04,854
Exactly.

784
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,700
When I said "we" I didn't mean "you" too!

785
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:33,166
Oh my god! what happened to you?

786
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,710
I'm fine.

787
01:00:34,913 --> 01:00:36,046
What do you want?

788
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,676
...last night you suddenly disappeared and...

789
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:43,169
and I thought that...

790
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:45,113
You came here for Max.

791
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:46,568
Max? No!

792
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:50,416
It's better that you go now.

793
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:52,970
Are you building there a bomb or what?

794
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:55,224
Anything else?

795
01:00:57,395 --> 01:00:58,862
What's wrong with you?

796
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:00,718
You're completely weird

797
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:02,112
Exactly

798
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,689
That's all you can see, right?

799
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:05,749
the freak weirdo

800
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:07,256
Do you know what?

801
01:01:07,562 --> 01:01:09,362
I wish I had never met you!

802
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:16,269
<i>We had to find MRX</i>

803
01:01:17,414 --> 01:01:18,414
<i>I was the decoy</i>

804
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,776
<i>We were lately so paranoic that
we could use only public networks</i>

805
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,531
Oh! here are you!

806
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:44,647
Come on fast!

807
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,712
He tried to contact MRX

808
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,127
His IP address is spoofed

809
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:04,982
he uses 100 different servers in Europe

810
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:08,929
He's changing his location at every 3 seconds!

811
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:09,999
I think I got something!

812
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,927
The server he uses more often points to this IP address

813
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:17,093
In Berlin!

814
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:20,065
Get as much information as you can, Katja

815
01:02:21,645 --> 01:02:24,378
<i>He gave me access to his private channel.</i>

816
01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,853
What are you waiting for?

817
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:20,327
We're running out of time!

818
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:21,534
I almost have it.

819
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:45,106
They're here!

820
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,411
Did you get it?

821
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:49,211
Let's get outta here!

822
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:51,185
Now.

823
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,147
We'll meet downstairs!

824
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:16,466
Nothing! as if the earth had swallowed him up!

825
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:42,445
I am suspended.

826
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:48,309
They're looking for someone else from Hague!

827
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,740
I'm sorry

828
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,077
What did MRX ask for?

829
01:06:19,214 --> 01:06:22,614
He wanted us to send a Trojan to the Europol system

830
01:06:24,723 --> 01:06:28,590
If someone has access to Europol,
can track investigations

831
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:29,948
and tamper

832
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:32,140
What was your plan?

833
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:34,779
We wanted to know who is MRX

834
01:06:35,176 --> 01:06:37,842
His identity in exchange for our freedom

835
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:40,668
We wanted to prove that he's behind Krypton's death

836
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:43,199
We wanted to disappear from the
1st position of the wanted list

837
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:46,512
We only wanted to be...invisible again

838
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:48,801
<i>To get access to MRX's computer</i>

839
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:51,687
<i>we had to reach deeply into our bag of tricks</i>

840
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:53,891
<i>Stefan called the application
"the pregnant horse"</i>

841
01:06:54,404 --> 01:06:57,037
<i>It was a Trojan horse inside of a Trojan horse.</i>

842
01:06:57,063 --> 01:07:00,763
<i>The second when MRX would log on to
the Europol server using our backdoor</i>

843
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:04,095
<i>we could be able to access his computer.</i>

844
01:07:04,097 --> 01:07:05,297
<i>And MRX's mask would fall.</i>

845
01:07:06,718 --> 01:07:09,718
<i>But before we had to destroy all the evidence</i>

846
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:28,292
I want to apologise...

847
01:07:30,558 --> 01:07:31,692
for the blue-eyed

848
01:07:33,378 --> 01:07:34,378
like Marie.

849
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:43,014
You knew all the time what she means to me

850
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:44,940
and you didn't give a fuck

851
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,219
What can I say? I'm an asshole.

852
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:55,093
The statement is true.

853
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:05,746
I'm an impostor! I could never do what you can

854
01:08:06,157 --> 01:08:08,290
I'm just a fucking script kiddie

855
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:10,314
I can't do more than copy/paste!

856
01:08:10,364 --> 01:08:11,964
I don't even know how to program!

857
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:15,754
I didn't know that

858
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:21,278
Do you like this?

859
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:22,739
Love birdies!

860
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:55,621
<i>We were on the way to Hague</i>

861
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:57,084
<i>to Europol</i>

862
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,386
<i>We had to get in the lion's den</i>

863
01:08:59,795 --> 01:09:01,262
<i>but the road was long.</i>

864
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:05,192
<i>We tried several methods</i>

865
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,239
<i>No success.</i>

866
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:10,221
<i>Our old phishing methods</i>

867
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:14,494
<i>We even tried to get in across the canalization.</i>

868
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:20,106
It's the only entrance.

869
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,947
What are you doing there?

870
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:31,283
A fucking nail!

871
01:09:32,694 --> 01:09:33,694
Take it out!

872
01:09:35,148 --> 01:09:39,148
<i>We had to admit that it was
impossible to enter the Europol.</i>

873
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:55,559
What are you looking at?

874
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,046
<i>It was my fault.</i>

875
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:16,604
<i>I've dragged us in this</i>

876
01:10:16,703 --> 01:10:17,703
<i>I also had to get us out.</i>

877
01:10:33,883 --> 01:10:36,550
<i>Man is by default trustful and confiding</i>

878
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:38,725
<i>Social engineering.</i>

879
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:45,943
<i>Come on! Believe in yourself!</i>

880
01:12:53,755 --> 01:12:56,421
<i>With Paul's box I could access a network</i>

881
01:12:56,528 --> 01:13:01,861
<i>and then a second one, in
parallel, a so called "evil twin"</i>

882
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:11,281
<i>If someone had logged in from one
of the offices in that network</i>

883
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,313
<i>I could access their laptop</i>

884
01:13:13,749 --> 01:13:15,016
<i>and then the server</i>

885
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:20,698
<i>MRX gave us an access key to a darknet channel</i>

886
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,532
<i>where we could find the instructions.</i>

887
01:13:25,464 --> 01:13:28,464
<i>I only had to give MRX the manipulated Trojan</i>

888
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:32,822
<i>As soon as he would log in in the Europol server</i>

889
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:34,551
<i>his mask would fall</i>

890
01:13:49,339 --> 01:13:50,939
<i>But MRX foiled our trick</i>

891
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,619
<i>MRX won the game</i>

892
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,525
<i>and I lost everything</i>

893
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:14,324
<i>Max, Paul, Stefan</i>

894
01:16:17,784 --> 01:16:18,917
<i>they're all dead.</i>

895
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:30,005
I want to be Benjamin again

896
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,036
I want to be invisible again

897
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,262
This is Anne! Call me as soon as you wake up!

898
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:44,609
You must come here immediately!

899
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:05,366
Finally no one else

900
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:12,274
You came...

901
01:17:13,764 --> 01:17:14,764
Yeah, I came.

902
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:24,398
Oscar said that someone hacked the
University's server some months ago

903
01:17:24,476 --> 01:17:26,276
and stole the questions for the Bachelor exam

904
01:17:26,983 --> 01:17:27,983
and got caught

905
01:17:35,503 --> 01:17:36,503
You once said that

906
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:42,007
you must find out who you are

907
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:47,938
..and that there are a lot of opportunities outside

908
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:50,214
but you can be whoever you want

909
01:17:50,557 --> 01:17:51,823
you can be anything

910
01:17:52,894 --> 01:17:54,094
Do you understand?

911
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:56,421
I can be the federation!

912
01:17:56,814 --> 01:17:57,881
You're a weirdo!

913
01:18:21,747 --> 01:18:23,747
Do you come with me?

914
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,399
I already said that you're crazy!

915
01:18:28,694 --> 01:18:29,694
Where?

916
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,106
Wherever you want.

917
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:32,107
Copenhagen?

918
01:18:32,938 --> 01:18:35,105
You can go anywhere and want to go to Copenhagen?

919
01:18:35,152 --> 01:18:36,152
Why not?

920
01:18:36,868 --> 01:18:37,868
Yeah...

921
01:18:38,485 --> 01:18:39,485
Why not.

922
01:18:50,378 --> 01:18:52,444
What else do you know about me?

923
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:55,607
Do you know that I'm suspended?

924
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,675
You want to be invisible again!

925
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:03,563
But the Fr13nds know who you are!

926
01:19:04,419 --> 01:19:05,953
You want a new identity

927
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:11,442
you want in the witness protection program!
that's all you always wanted!

928
01:19:12,616 --> 01:19:15,016
For this I give you MRX, the Fr13nds

929
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:17,394
It's not that easy!

930
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:19,985
The Federal Criminal Police Office will be successful

931
01:19:20,962 --> 01:19:22,762
politics and media, pleased

932
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:24,640
You are rehabilitated.

933
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:47,919
Let's say I agree.

934
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,630
How will you get MRX?

935
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:57,924
Using a magic trick

936
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,867
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!

937
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:02,887
He's nothing

938
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,291
A no one!

939
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:07,246
He played with fire and got burned

940
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:09,658
but he can lead us to MRX!

941
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,263
If we have him we will also get the Fr13nds!

942
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:13,273
You're suspended!

943
01:20:16,188 --> 01:20:19,854
The promise of the witness protection program must end.

944
01:20:21,177 --> 01:20:22,510
I need you for this!

945
01:20:27,243 --> 01:20:29,443
How should work this magic trick?

946
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:32,617
We will attack MRX's weakest point

947
01:20:34,391 --> 01:20:35,391
his pride!

948
01:22:46,804 --> 01:22:47,804
We got him!

949
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,608
What's his real name?

950
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:54,324
19 years old

951
01:22:54,985 --> 01:22:55,985
from New York

952
01:22:56,668 --> 01:22:58,668
You should be the last one too

953
01:22:59,065 --> 01:23:00,665
so that you're not alone

954
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:02,571
That's from Superman!

955
01:23:04,968 --> 01:23:07,101
In a few hours you're a freeman!

956
01:23:08,241 --> 01:23:09,441
New name, new city

957
01:23:30,102 --> 01:23:33,702
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!

958
01:24:45,148 --> 01:24:48,681
I'd like to ask you some questions.

959
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:56,213
Do you know this person?

960
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:58,051
No.

961
01:24:59,662 --> 01:25:01,995
He said you were in the same class.

962
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:05,790
The freak!

963
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:09,356
Have you seen Benjamin lately?

964
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,330
No.

965
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:14,735
Excuse me.

966
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:16,353
What's this all about?

967
01:25:16,372 --> 01:25:18,905
Benjamin is under the BKA's attention.

968
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:22,197
He declared that in the last months you met often

969
01:25:22,328 --> 01:25:23,328
We did what?

970
01:25:25,514 --> 01:25:26,981
He's completely crazy!

971
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:31,295
I'd never like to meet such a guy!

972
01:25:38,193 --> 01:25:40,393
Thank you for having time for me!

973
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,577
It's about Engel

974
01:25:42,072 --> 01:25:43,572
Or better said "your angel"

975
01:25:43,614 --> 01:25:44,414
You know him?

976
01:25:44,429 --> 01:25:45,429
Since he was young.

977
01:25:47,269 --> 01:25:48,702
I have curated his mother.

978
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,040
What can you tell me about him?

979
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,974
He's uncommunicative

980
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:53,404
outsider

981
01:25:54,312 --> 01:25:55,912
No wonders in his story.

982
01:25:56,142 --> 01:25:58,009
His mother took her own life

983
01:25:58,337 --> 01:26:01,404
Benjamin has grown up in unclear circumstances

984
01:26:01,914 --> 01:26:04,181
His mother had an identity problem

985
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,740
Schizophrenia?

986
01:26:06,168 --> 01:26:08,101
Multiple personality disorder

987
01:26:08,565 --> 01:26:12,498
She had multiple personalities
thinking they're all herself

988
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,067
The medication kept her at bay.

989
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:18,060
In the end she couldn't endure anymore.

990
01:26:18,405 --> 01:26:19,505
Is it inheritable?

991
01:26:19,602 --> 01:26:20,602
Possible.

992
01:26:20,944 --> 01:26:22,344
What is it caused by?

993
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:26,544
It can be caused by a
predisposition to other substances

994
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:30,225
Some medicines can make the symptoms even stronger

995
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,420
There are several triggers.

996
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:33,463
Ritalin?

997
01:26:35,217 --> 01:26:36,750
Ritalin is one of them.

998
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,719
But what it's all about?

999
01:26:41,873 --> 01:26:44,273
Is everything alright with Benjamin?

1000
01:27:06,246 --> 01:27:08,079
The laboratory results are here!

1001
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,090
Let me guess! The bullets are from the 2nd World War!

1002
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:11,094
Yes.

1003
01:27:17,171 --> 01:27:18,971
How did you get this wound?

1004
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:20,327
what did hurt you?

1005
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:22,764
Why were the car keys at you?

1006
01:27:23,023 --> 01:27:26,089
It is supposed that Stefan has driven the car!

1007
01:27:26,147 --> 01:27:28,480
What did you tell me about Paul? about his mother?

1008
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:29,742
She died when he was young

1009
01:27:30,274 --> 01:27:31,274
That's you!

1010
01:27:33,629 --> 01:27:34,696
They're all you!

1011
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:37,930
No. They're dead!

1012
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,159
There are no dead bodies! No evidence!

1013
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,343
In any damn hotel in Hague!

1014
01:27:48,837 --> 01:27:50,837
What you saw in the hotel room

1015
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:07,962
doesn't exist!

1016
01:28:10,688 --> 01:28:13,155
You made them up in your imagination!

1017
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:17,469
CLAY - that's you alone!

1018
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:22,359
You are Max

1019
01:28:24,577 --> 01:28:26,844
What? Did you think that I live here?

1020
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:28,133
You are Stefan!

1021
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:32,182
You are Paul!

1022
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,286
Every action, it was you!

1023
01:28:38,988 --> 01:28:39,988
Alone!

1024
01:28:40,187 --> 01:28:42,020
I don't even know one half of the people!

1025
01:28:42,062 --> 01:28:43,062
All shit suckers!

1026
01:28:43,278 --> 01:28:44,278
We need a name!

1027
01:28:44,693 --> 01:28:46,560
We must become a brand! We must become famous!

1028
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:48,619
All what attention generates is counterproductive

1029
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,408
We're staying off the radar!

1030
01:28:50,488 --> 01:28:52,588
Nothing off the radar! Brand is awesome!

1031
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:55,442
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

1032
01:28:57,379 --> 01:28:58,379
Like MRX!

1033
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,600
fucking nail!

1034
01:29:11,322 --> 01:29:12,655
I'm not like my mom!

1035
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:24,699
I know who I am

1036
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:31,334
That means that our agreement

1037
01:29:33,133 --> 01:29:36,533
disqualifies you for the witness protection program

1038
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:39,308
No! You said we have a deal

1039
01:29:39,654 --> 01:29:40,654
a caution!

1040
01:29:40,846 --> 01:29:42,979
I get the witness protection
program, that's what you said!

1041
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,077
I'm sorry!

1042
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:45,894
They killed Krypton

1043
01:29:46,635 --> 01:29:48,768
I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!

1044
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:50,105
Do you understand?

1045
01:29:50,357 --> 01:29:52,437
We had a deal! I get the witness protection program!

1046
01:29:52,473 --> 01:29:53,593
That's what you promised me!

1047
01:29:54,781 --> 01:29:55,781
I'm sorry.

1048
01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:57,533
You're sick!

1049
01:29:58,109 --> 01:29:59,443
I'm not like my mom!

1050
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:15,977
I'm sorry!

1051
01:30:21,627 --> 01:30:24,961
The Fr13nds will kill me like they killed Krypton!

1052
01:30:26,425 --> 01:30:28,691
I want witness protection program!

1053
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,367
You promised me!

1054
01:30:44,563 --> 01:30:45,563
Congrats!

1055
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,272
The collaboration between the Europol and BKA
 (Federal Criminal Police Office)

1056
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:58,366
has been from the start a composite of
efficiency, professionality and certain

1057
01:30:58,758 --> 01:31:01,291
Responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg

1058
01:31:01,755 --> 01:31:04,821
an exceptional fighter against the cyber mafia

1059
01:31:05,327 --> 01:31:07,860
The Internet is not a legal black hole

1060
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,990
its doors aren't invisible!

1061
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:12,175
Anyone can be traced.

1062
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:16,885
I asked them to bring you to the court.

1063
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:47,368
I'm sorry for hacking you!

1064
01:31:49,548 --> 01:31:50,548
It wasn't fair

1065
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:16,495
The witness protection program is literally a program

1066
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:21,439
You have 5 minutes

1067
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,729
<i>What will you tell them?</i>

1068
01:32:34,097 --> 01:32:36,664
<i>That you're on the way to the courthouse</i>

1069
01:32:36,722 --> 01:32:37,722
<i>Won't you be fired again?</i>

1070
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:42,931
<i>They wanted MRX, the Fr13nds. You're a nobody to them!</i>

1071
01:32:44,506 --> 01:32:46,173
<i>You're invisible to them!</i>

1072
01:32:48,392 --> 01:32:51,059
Promise me that you're done with hacking

1073
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,250
I promise!

1074
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,284
No magic tricks anymore

1075
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:05,927
Wait!

1076
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:08,396
Just one more thing

1077
01:33:14,919 --> 01:33:16,719
How do you make this trick?

1078
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:26,695
If you know how's working, it's less deceiving

1079
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:37,578
Everyone sees what they wanna see

1080
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:42,810
Take care!

1081
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,340
She swallowed it hook, line and sinker.

1082
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:30,193
The all time greatest social engineering trick

1083
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:33,139
Not even the Europol knows now who you are.

1084
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:34,159
What name did you pick?

1085
01:35:34,347 --> 01:35:35,347
No name

1086
01:35:42,181 --> 01:35:43,181
<i>OK. Who am I?</i>

1087
01:35:44,543 --> 01:35:45,543
<i>I'm Benjamin.</i>

1088
01:35:46,043 --> 01:35:47,043
<i>I'm a hacker.</i>

1089
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,910
<i>and this is my story.</i>

1090
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:55,015
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

1091
01:35:55,419 --> 01:35:58,085
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

1092
01:36:02,814 --> 01:36:03,847
Where have you been?

1093
01:36:03,916 --> 01:36:04,916
They have my computer!

1094
01:36:05,304 --> 01:36:06,504
They know who am I, we all gotta get outta here!

1095
01:36:06,954 --> 01:36:07,954
What happened?

1096
01:36:07,984 --> 01:36:09,051
I was at Europol

1097
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,767
How did you get in there?

1098
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:14,542
I pretended to be one of the students from a group
it doesn't fuckin' matter!

1099
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:15,576
The task.. was a failure!
They got.. they have all my personal details!

1100
01:36:16,259 --> 01:36:18,259
Everything! Do you understand?

1101
01:36:18,281 --> 01:36:20,748
We gotta get outta here! Immediately!

1102
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,246
Come on! What are you waiting for?

1103
01:36:27,579 --> 01:36:28,712
You're one of us!

1104
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:31,541
We don't forsake you!

1105
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:36,698
Now what?

1106
01:36:46,813 --> 01:36:48,413
No system is unhackable.

1107
01:36:50,088 --> 01:36:55,488
Excluded from the witness protection program
are persons having psychic diseases

1108
01:36:57,594 --> 01:36:58,594
Once again

1109
01:37:00,038 --> 01:37:02,305
Give her very detailed information

1110
01:37:02,665 --> 01:37:05,132
this works only if you trust yourself

1111
01:37:05,658 --> 01:37:08,058
And if she doesn't feel mainpulated!

1112
01:37:11,657 --> 01:37:12,657
You can do it!

1113
01:37:15,145 --> 01:37:16,278
Only this is left

1114
01:37:27,989 --> 01:37:28,989
Ready?

1115
01:37:36,424 --> 01:37:37,757
We're all invisible!

1116
01:37:39,552 --> 01:37:40,886
What if she checked?

1117
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:44,050
Don't worry!

1118
01:37:45,302 --> 01:37:46,369
She has checked.

1119
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:48,874
But she has what she wants

1120
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,308
No more magic tricks.

1121
01:37:53,333 --> 01:38:53,333
