1
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,986
- What's new?
- Same old daily bunkeroo.

2
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:43,912
Mr. Powers says he wants to see
that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.

3
00:01:47,344 --> 00:01:49,514
Don't declare war for a few minutes.

4
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:06,912
"According to a high official,
it is believed"...

5
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,217
Foreign correspondent.

6
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,959
I could get more news out of Europe
looking in the crystal ball.

7
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:15,774
That Stebbins cable has a morsel in it.

8
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:18,932
Stebbins makes me sick.
They all make me sick.

9
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:20,791
Europe about to blow up...

10
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:24,689
and all I can get from my foreign staff
is a daily guessing game.

11
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,400
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley.
- For instance?

12
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,134
Any kind of fact.

13
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,526
There must be something
going on in Europe...

14
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,289
beside a nervous breakdown.

15
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,230
Why not try sending me over, Mr. Powers?

16
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,452
You've written a book
on economics or something.

17
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:43,463
<i>The Twilight of Feudalism?</i>

18
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:46,219
- Yes. It was very well received.
- Not by me.

19
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:50,278
I don't want any more economists, sages,
or oracles bombinating over our cable.

20
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,559
I want a reporter.

21
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:54,790
Someone who doesn't know the difference
between an ism and a kangaroo.

22
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,987
<i>A good, honest crime reporter.
That's what the Globe needs.</i>

23
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,430
That's what Europe needs.

24
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,342
There's a crime hatching
on that bedeviled continent.

25
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,218
Wait a minute.

26
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:07,581
I've got something
that might pass for an idea.

27
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,826
Who was that fellow that ran down
the payroll robbery last week?

28
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,172
You mean Johnny Jones.

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,856
He beat up a policeman, didn't he,
in the line of duty?

30
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:19,826
Yes. There's some talk at the city desk
of firing him.

31
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,293
Beat up a policeman?

32
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,080
Sounds ideal for Europe.

33
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,298
Send Mr. Jones up here right away.

34
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:33,067
- Mr. Powers wants to see you, Mr. Jones.
- He does?

35
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,856
- You should come to his office right away.
- What about?

36
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,777
I ain't in his confidence.

37
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,557
Tell him to save his breath.
Tell him I've resigned.

38
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:44,615
- I'm supposed to bring you there.
- Okay. Wait till I open this.

39
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:52,101
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!

40
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,231
- Are you Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

41
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:00,834
Sit down, please.

42
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,281
- You mind a personal question?
- No.

43
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:07,295
- Are you married?
- No luck.

44
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,506
Single?

45
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,454
- Ever been in Europe?
- No.

46
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,243
What's your opinion
of the present European crisis, Mr. Jones?

47
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:17,657
What crisis?

48
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,159
I'm referring to
the impending war, Mr. Jones.

49
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:26,159
That. To tell you the truth,
I haven't given it much thought.

50
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,938
You don't keep up
with our foreign news, do you?

51
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:32,306
If you're gonna fire me,
you can scrap the intelligence test.

52
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,799
It's perfectly okay with me.

53
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,873
I can get a job on any newspaper in town
within an hour. So long.

54
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,180
Wait a minute. Nobody fired you.

55
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:42,500
How would you like to cover
the biggest story in the world today?

56
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,459
With an expense account,
I'll cover anything.

57
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:45,985
You'll get an expense account.

58
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,262
- Okay, what's the story?
- Europe.

59
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,206
I'm afraid I'm not exactly equipped,
but I could read up.

60
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:54,085
No reading up. I like you just as you are.

61
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,864
What Europe needs
is a fresh, unused mind.

62
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,580
- Foreign correspondent?
- No. Reporter.

63
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,696
I don't want correspondence. I want news.

64
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:08,795
- Can you dig up some news in Europe?
- I'll be happy to try, sir.

65
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,072
This is what I mean:

66
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,206
Mr. Van Meer, when questioned
by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...

67
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,097
refused to open his mouth.

68
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,071
A 1,200-word cable told...

69
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,894
to the fact that
the great Van Meer had nothing to say.

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,668
Know what that's doing? It's driving
our readers crazy with frustration.

71
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:27,441
- Who's Van Meer?
- Keynote to the European situation today.

72
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,926
If Van Meer stays
at the helm of his country's affairs...

73
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:33,741
for the next three months,
it may mean peace in Europe.

74
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,873
If we knew what he was thinking
we'd know where Europe stands.

75
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:39,243
- German?
- No. Holland's strongman.

76
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:42,086
One of the two signers
of the Dutch treaty with Belgium.

77
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:45,633
Now, this is your first assignment.
I want you to talk with him...

78
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:48,867
find out what's in that treaty,
and what he thinks will happen. Facts.

79
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,849
- Van Meer?
- Right.

80
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,227
- Anybody else?
- No.

81
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,845
How about Hitler?
Don't you think we should pump him?

82
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,988
He must have something on his mind.

83
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,910
<i>- Yes?
- Mr. Stephen Fisher to see you.</i>

84
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,789
Tell him to come in.

85
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,422
Ever hear of Stephen Fisher?

86
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:09,077
- I'm afraid he's not on my beat.
- He is from now on.

87
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:12,213
He's head of the Universal Peace Party
and very close to Van Meer.

88
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:15,379
They're both working
to prevent Europe going up in flames.

89
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:19,854
How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
Nice of you to come over.

90
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,546
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

91
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,238
Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones,
our new foreign correspondent.

92
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,485
I want you to know each other.

93
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:27,048
How do you do, Mr. Jones.

94
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:31,113
Jones. I don't like that name.
It's going to handicap you, young man.

95
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:35,435
Now, wait a minute.
I've got some sort of a name here.

96
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,266
Yes. Haverstock. Huntley Haverstock.

97
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,509
Sounds more important,
doesn't it, Mr. Fisher?

98
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,039
Yes, very dashing.

99
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,021
Sounds better than Richard Harding Davis.

100
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:47,549
- What's the matter with that?
- We can't use that.

101
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:51,068
That's the name of one of our
greatest war correspondents 40 years ago.

102
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,880
Speak up, young man. You don't mind
being Huntley Haverstock, do you?

103
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,506
A rose by any name, sir.

104
00:06:56,578 --> 00:07:00,220
It's exciting being present at the
christening of a newspaper correspondent.

105
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,457
Shouldnt we break
a bottle of champagne?

106
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:06,452
Break one over my head to see
if I'm still awake. Huntley Haverstock.

107
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:10,039
Mr. Haverstock, you better get started.
You've got a lot to do.

108
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:12,014
- Passports, photos, visas...
- Expenses.

109
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,648
I'll send a note to the cashier.

110
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,492
- I hope you brought your Sunday articles.
- I managed three of them.

111
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,555
- See you in London then, Mr. Haverstock.
- Yes, of course.

112
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:23,528
Thank you, Mr. Powers.
Thank you for everything.

113
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:25,805
Except Huntley Haverstock.

114
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,916
Get a load of this, Mother.
How's it look? Chic?

115
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:49,371
Don't wear it over one eye.
It makes you look like a dandy.

116
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,289
You always think the boys are wearing
their hats over one eye.

117
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:55,668
- Let him wear it the way it is.
- He'll have to wear a stovepipe in London.

118
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:58,131
- They call them poppers over there.
- Toppers.

119
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:01,204
Bobby, put that in the box for Uncle John,
will you?

120
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,696
- Let me try it on.
- No, I want to try it on.

121
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:06,552
- Now he's a regular war correspondent.
- Without a war.

122
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,243
I'm afraid he'll get his war.

123
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:11,540
- They're throwing a big bluff over there.
- Let's hope so.

124
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,895
How do you like the way
we've our little nest furnished?

125
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:18,792
If I were you, I'd hang lighter curtains,
and move that sofa out here.

126
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,004
It's too bad you haven't an open fireplace.

127
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:24,268
If you'd speak to the captain,
I think he'd attend to everything.

128
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,985
All ashore that's going ashore!

129
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,032
Now, Mother.

130
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:34,663
Goodbye, John.

131
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,736
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

132
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,932
<i>You're Jones?
I'm Stebbins, London man for the Globe.</i>

133
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,818
Mr. Powers told me you'd probably
be here. Nice of you to come.

134
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,770
Reminds me. I lost mine on the way over.

135
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,932
I can say your other name, too.
That Huntley...

136
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,367
I could say it yesterday...

137
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:23,300
but I had a rather tough session
with the boys last night.

138
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:26,504
- So I'll stick to Jones if you don't mind.
- Jones is great with me.

139
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:30,148
Let's go. This crowd's making me nervous.
My nerves aren't in the pink.

140
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:32,835
Just take it easy.
I'll follow you right along.

141
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,481
Porter, bring those bags. And don't
bang them into my knees from behind.

142
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:42,104
What about a drink
after that long train ride?

143
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,967
Sounds like a very logical idea.

144
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,554
I may not act it,
but I've been here 25 years.

145
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,819
<i>London man for the Globe
and they haven't caught onto me yet.</i>

146
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,163
How'd you manage it?

147
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,596
Cable back the government handouts
and sign them...

148
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,089
"Our London correspondent."

149
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,235
- What's yours?
- Scotch and soda, please.

150
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,713
Miss?

151
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:02,771
Miss, please.

152
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,278
- Scotch and soda, and a glass of milk.
- A glass of milk?

153
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,183
I'm on the wagon. I went to the doctor
today about these jitters I got...

154
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:15,079
and he said it was the wagon for a month
or a whole new set of organs.

155
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,453
I can't afford a whole new set of organs.

156
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,714
If I'd known you're on the wagon,
I could have got along without this.

157
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,788
But as long as it's here...

158
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,616
Good luck.

159
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,682
Good?

160
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,128
- Yeah, just like any other Scotch and soda.
- That's what I thought.

161
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,956
Doesrt taste the way it did
when I was a baby. That's got poison in it.

162
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,198
Speaking of that, I've got some pills
I got to take.

163
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:42,080
Here's some cables that have been
coming over from New York.

164
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:46,005
They love to cable. It makes them think
you're working for them.

165
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,426
There's an invitation to that lunch
for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow.

166
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,875
I guess that's your dish.

167
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,583
This is given by the Universal Peace Party.
That's Fisher's organization, right?

168
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,136
I don't know.
I don't follow those things very much.

169
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,101
New York wants it, I send it.
That's the secret of being a correspondent.

170
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,996
Been doing it 25 years.

171
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:06,376
Twenty-five years, and I end up on milk.

172
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,562
Good morning. How's the water wagon?

173
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,312
Look at that.
One of them shook off this morning.

174
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm just on my way
to the Van Meer luncheon.

175
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:41,248
I'm lunching with old man Clark.
He's the International Press...

176
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:45,270
Here you are. I didn't know whether
to meet you in the grill or upstairs.

177
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,951
Goodbye, Stebbins. Goodbye, Miss Clark.

178
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:52,345
Who's he calling Clark? He's got his nerve.

179
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,577
Some fresh American reporter.

180
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,754
Good morning, Mr. Van Meer.

181
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,947
I beg your pardon, sir.
You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?

182
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,425
That's my name, yes.

183
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,877
I'm Haverstock. You don't know me.
I'm an American.

184
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,799
And I just happen to be
on my way to your luncheon.

185
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,196
- Then, perhaps...
- That's very kind of you, sir...

186
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:15,977
Come, come. It's all in a good cause.

187
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,664
Savoy Hotel.

188
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,062
- This is very kind of you.
- It's a pleasure, my boy.

189
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,237
I dislike riding alone.

190
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:32,888
One thinks too much while riding alone.

191
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:36,605
Yes, exactly. The Polish situation,
and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians...

192
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,973
must be on your mind
quite a lot these days.

193
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,755
What do you feel
that England will do in case the Nazis...

194
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,708
England is so beautiful.

195
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,280
It's nice to see London in the sunshine.

196
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,314
Always there's lots of rain or fog.

197
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:53,201
Also it is August.

198
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:55,920
I found out it was August.
That's pretty good for me.

199
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,581
Would you mind telling me...

200
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,302
how you feel about Mr. Fisher
and his Peace Organization?

201
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,475
You know Mr. Fisher?

202
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:06,024
A very fine man. And a good man.

203
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:09,607
I wish there were more like him
in the world just now.

204
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:12,458
I take it you don't think
there's much hope for peace?

205
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:15,522
I mean, you don't think
one little peace organization...

206
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,081
can make much headway
against the European war panic?

207
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:20,256
I would like to think so.

208
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:21,985
Look at those birds.

209
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,795
No matter how big the city,
there must always be parks...

210
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,321
and places for the birds to live.

211
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:31,257
I was walking
through the park this morning...

212
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,142
and I saw several people feeding the birds.

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,108
It's a good sign at a time like this.
Is it not?

214
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:39,449
Yes, it's a dandy sign...

215
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,450
but I do think that right now
birds are the least of our problems.

216
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,620
Your country, for instance.
What's its attitude toward these matters?

217
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,892
We're now near the Savoy.

218
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,148
- How much?
- A shilling.

219
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,064
That's fine.

220
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:07,110
By the way, young man,
what newspaper do you represent?

221
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,725
As a matter of fact,
I'm not exactly a reporter...

222
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:13,827
but I was trying to get you to talk.
I didn't want bird talk either.

223
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:15,456
I gathered that.

224
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:20,292
Just what was it
that you were trying to get me to tell you?

225
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:24,512
I'm trying to find out what you know
about the possibility of a general war.

226
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,302
How do you really feel about it?

227
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,630
My boy, I feel very old and sad...

228
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,286
and helpless.

229
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,604
I did have one.

230
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,111
The last news from Poland
was very alarming.

231
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:24,894
- Nobody wants a war...
- Then we don't have to have it.

232
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:28,123
You must understand, often circumstances
over which we've no control...

233
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:31,637
Yes, those convenient circumstances
over which we have no control.

234
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,847
It's always odd,
but they usually bring on a war.

235
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,664
You never hear of circumstances
over which we've no control...

236
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,802
rushing us into peace, do you?

237
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,628
Very determined woman, my daughter.

238
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,990
Come on. Let's go and see
if you can pick a fight somewhere else.

239
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,777
- Good for you.
- Wasrt he a bore?

240
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,852
Many won'thy people are, bless them.

241
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,159
How do you like to be fishing in Ireland
right now?

242
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:52,778
We haven't had a good sail
or swim together in months.

243
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,433
Not even a game of cribbage. Miss them?

244
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,386
There's the Admiral.

245
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:00,167
He has a weakness for you.
Go on. Do your stuff.

246
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:03,682
Here you are. The Jones that became
a Haverstock. Have a good trip?

247
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,510
Still wish you were Richard Harding Davis.

248
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,326
- So do I, sir. Anything except...
- Hello.

249
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:12,700
<i>Mrs. Appleby, meet Huntley Haverstock,
Special Correspondent, New York Globe.</i>

250
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,194
- Foreign correspondent? Not really.
- Cross my heart.

251
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,878
You look such a dear, sweet boy.
You don't seem a bit like the others.

252
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,855
But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.

253
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,230
Do you know a friend of mine,
Monte Rockingham?

254
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:26,425
He's in the embassy at Istanbul.
Or is it Honolulu?

255
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:29,658
Do help me with this
distinguished-looking gentleman here.

256
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:33,465
I can't make any headway with him,
but I'm sure he speaks some language.

257
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,416
I haven't the least idea who he is...

258
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:38,546
but there's nobody here
who isn't internationally important.

259
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,753
- This is Mr. Haver...
- Stock.

260
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:48,527
No English?

261
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,489
Try German.

262
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:55,979
Splendid. What else do you know?

263
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,313
- Only pig Latin.
- Pig Latin.

264
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,866
Here we are. This will do it.

265
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,815
Now we're getting somewhere.
The universal language.

266
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,381
Dear Maharajah.

267
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:21,556
Well, they come in pairs.

268
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,539
If you speak English,
give me a hand with the laughing Latvian.

269
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:26,993
- What's his racket? What's he talking?
- Latvian.

270
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,554
No kidding. I didn't know
the Lats had a language.

271
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,926
I thought they just rubbed noses.

272
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:37,294
- You mean you actually speak Latvian?
- Just enough to get about.

273
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,425
What does just enough to get about
consist of in Latvian?

274
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,354
I don't think you'd have any trouble.

275
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,785
Be a comfort to know when I get to Latvia.

276
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,532
You think there's a chance
of you getting to Latvia soon?

277
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,029
Never can tell in my racket.

278
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,469
I suppose you've guessed
I'm a foreign correspondent.

279
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,257
Are you? That's nice.

280
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:57,633
I see you're taking notes.
Are you covering this affair, too?

281
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,266
I sort of work here.

282
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,987
Publicity? You're just the one
I'm looking for.

283
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,771
We've got to go in a secret conference
right away.

284
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,495
Me? Excuse me.

285
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:13,852
I beg your pardon, sir.
I have a Latvian friend here...

286
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,538
who's particularly interested
in the origin of the kilt.

287
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:20,119
I wonder if you'd be interested
in talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.

288
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,261
It's a most amazing story.

289
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,544
You see, the Greeks, in the early period,
they used to wear a kilt.

290
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,651
Now, what is this big secret conference
all about?

291
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,158
It's no secret as far as I'm concerned.
However, I'll let you in on that later.

292
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,253
Since you're handling publicity here,
give me a line on what it's about...

293
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:40,210
this league for peace and understanding.

294
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:42,128
Just what is it you'd like to know?

295
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:45,322
In the first place, is this Mr. Fisher
entirely on the level?

296
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,819
Very much so.

297
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:50,151
- Seems like a very nice guy.
- He is, I assure you.

298
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:54,339
What is it that makes him or you
think that an organization like this...

299
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,198
made up of well-meaning amateurs...

300
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,566
buck up against those
tough military boys of Europe?

301
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:03,037
It's the well-meaning amateurs
who do the fighting when the war comes.

302
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,977
- Luncheon is served.
- Please don't go yet.

303
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,156
You don't want those
dreary chicken patties.

304
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,687
I'm sorry. I must go.

305
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,932
Then sit at the press table with me.

306
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,868
Nobody ever listens to the speeches,
and we could talk.

307
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,600
You don't even know my name yet.

308
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,807
- Is it necessary?
- It is to me.

309
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:21,297
Don't mind if you hear
it's Huntley Haverstock...

310
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:23,225
because it's really Jones.

311
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,777
- What's yours?
- Mine's really Smith.

312
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,884
Don't mind if you hear it's anything else.

313
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,468
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,438
Same young lady. Try again.

315
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:42,155
I've taken the young lady 13 notes, sir.
She won't accept any more.

316
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:50,056
Milords, ladies and gentlemen...

317
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:53,121
pray silence for your chairman...

318
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:55,746
Mr. Stephen Fisher.

319
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement to make...

320
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:03,416
which I'm sure will be
a great disappointment to us all.

321
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:06,043
I've just received this telegram
from Mr. Van Meer...

322
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:09,014
who was to have been
our guest of honor today.

323
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:12,891
"Deeply regret. Called away suddenly
owing to unforeseen circumstances.

324
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,738
"And I will be unable
to attend your meeting as planned.

325
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:18,225
"I am with you and your work
with all my heart.

326
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,199
"I could not have said more
had I been there."

327
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:25,358
Although this removes
one of our star attractions...

328
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:28,528
we may, as a result, have more time
to tell you from the inside...

329
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:32,555
just what this party has stood for
and why we've asked you here today.

330
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,270
I can think of no one
more competent to do this...

331
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,384
than the speaker I'm about to introduce.

332
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,876
I trust you won't think this a family affair...

333
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:43,877
when I say that I refer to my daughter
Miss Carol Fisher.

334
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,557
Milords, ladies and gentlemen...

335
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,817
pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher.

336
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,015
Ladies and gentlemen...

337
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:12,696
I trust, even making allowances
for a father's exuberance...

338
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,888
you do not think I'm in any way
being put forward today...

339
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:18,262
as a substitute for Mr. Van Meer.

340
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,771
Unappily for us,
no one can take Mr. Van Meer's place.

341
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,713
What I can do possibly
is to clear up a few misapprehensions...

342
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:28,714
that have crept into
the public discussion of this movement...

343
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:32,014
and revise some of the epithets
that have been applied to us...

344
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:35,145
by some who have not gone
as deeply into the matter as they might.

345
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:37,930
The female of the species
is deadlier than the male.

346
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,582
...as a group of well-meaning amateurs.

347
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,975
Now, I'm sure there's some of you
here today who think of us as such.

348
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:48,033
I'd like to ask anyone who has called us
well-meaning amateurs...

349
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:51,964
to stand up and tell me
just why a well-meaning amateur...

350
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,614
is any less reliable than a well-meaning
professional at a moment like this.

351
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:57,243
But I'll not take the time.

352
00:21:57,314 --> 00:22:00,312
The world's been run long enough
by the well-meaning professional.

353
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,872
We might give the amateurs
a chance now.

354
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:06,553
But what I really want to do
is to give you a very brief idea of...

355
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,172
just how far-reaching
our amateur plans are.

356
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:18,164
Use your notes.

357
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:20,301
And just...

358
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,216
why we ask for your support...

359
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:24,843
professional or amateur.

360
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,420
What I mean to say is that,
however much one may...

361
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,665
I mean, we should both...

362
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:37,954
Both of us...

363
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,725
Tell them to wait in there.

364
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,754
- Mr. Fisher, how are you?
- When did you get over here?

365
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:07,955
Just now. I had a cable.
This conference is my first assignment.

366
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:11,797
An ironic assignment. A peace conference
under the shadow of war.

367
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:12,942
It's really coming?

368
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:15,314
Today and tomorrow will tell.
There's still hope.

369
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,786
I'm going back to London today.

370
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,494
Leaving for London? I just got here.
But the conference is just beginning.

371
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:24,204
Today and tomorrow the work for peace
is in London rather than Amsterdam.

372
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:27,881
You're taking your whole staff
back to London with you, including your...

373
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,242
No. I have someone staying here
who'll give you all the help you need.

374
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:34,023
You'll be in very good hands. Here she is.

375
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,447
Mrs. Appleby. Mr. Haverstock.

376
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:39,519
We met at the luncheon.
You remember him, don't you.

377
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,891
He's nice, but I still can't understand him.

378
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:45,087
<i>Dr. Williamson, this is Huntley Haverstock
of the New York Globe.</i>

379
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,543
He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam
and peace meetings.

380
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:50,038
Would you be good enough
to take him under your wing?

381
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,981
Perhaps you'll both see
that he samples Dutch cheese...

382
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,396
at dinner tonight.

383
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:58,616
Now I must see what unlucky person
will give up his seat on the London plane.

384
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:00,887
Don't get into any mischief, will you?

385
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:02,547
Mischief?

386
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,591
- Your first visit to Amsterdam?
- Yes.

387
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:07,183
You must let me take you
to Rembrandt's house...

388
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:11,344
It might be a good idea if we went over
the agenda of the conference with him.

389
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,867
If you'll excuse me. I think I see a friend.

390
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,011
Mr. Van Meer. How are you?

391
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:30,335
We somehow seemed to lose each other
day before yesterday.

392
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm so sorry you were called away.

393
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:34,653
Don't you remember me?

394
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:38,042
We shared the same cab together
on the way to the luncheon.

395
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:39,387
Excuse me.

396
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,142
May I have your picture, Mr. Van Meer?
Thank you.

397
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:56,912
There he goes!

398
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:04,496
He's getting away!

399
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:52,058
Follow that car, quick!

400
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:00,400
You'd better get out of here.
Might be dangerous.

401
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:02,161
Don't be silly. Drive on.

402
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,379
- Who has he shot?
- Van Meer assassinated.

403
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:08,044
- Dead?
- Looked like it.

404
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:11,146
- Bad show.
- Couldrt be worse from his viewpoint.

405
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:17,158
Do you mind shoving your knees
out of the way.

406
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,848
- You better hop in the back, old girl.
- Hurry.

407
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,794
Safety glass. I wonder whose make.

408
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,800
- Good chauffeur you've got.
- Yes, isn't he?

409
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,150
You know each other?

410
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:56,470
This is Scott ffolliott, newspaperman,
same as you. Foreign correspondent.

411
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,738
- Mr. Haverstock, Mr. Ffolliott.
- With a double "F."

412
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:00,398
How do you do?

413
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,776
I don't get the double "F."

414
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,850
They're at the beginning. Both small "F's".

415
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,384
They can't be at the beginning.

416
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,912
One of my ancestors
was beheaded by Henry Vlll.

417
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:11,114
His wife dropped the capital letter
to commemorate it. There it is.

418
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:16,741
- How do you say it, like a stutter?
- Just a straight "fuh."

419
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,355
- It's stopped raining. Surs coming up.
- The police are coming.

420
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:08,167
It's the most amazing disappearing trick
I've ever seen.

421
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,820
You don't suppose they could've got up
that high, do you?

422
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:28,567
Vanished.

423
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,805
- Take a look for yourself.
- Tell him your name with the small "F"s.

424
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:36,504
That'll be a bit over his head.

425
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:43,638
This isn't catching any assassins.

426
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,877
We should have kept a policeman
and played bridge.

427
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,405
I guess you're right.

428
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,703
I'll bet 2-to-1 on the derby.

429
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:21,060
Look at those sails on that windmill.

430
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,288
You'll get used to those
when you've been in Holland longer.

431
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:27,706
I was sure they were going
against the wind.

432
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:30,110
Why don't you lie down on the grass
and cool off?

433
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:33,403
I'll cool off in due time.
But first get the police back here.

434
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,574
- The police again?
- We don't want them.

435
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,498
- I won't be prosecuting.
- No...

436
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,734
- Get the police, our mars there.
- Where?

437
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,907
- In that mill.
- What makes you think so?

438
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:45,140
A lot of things can happen
while I'm explaining. Please get the police.

439
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,800
I'd go myself if I spoke the language.

440
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,942
- What will you do?
- A little bit of snooping.

441
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,052
I hate to seem executive.
But this is serious.

442
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,123
- Come on, Scott.
- All right. You shall have your police.

443
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:23,355
It's a signal.
It's a signal for that plane to land.

444
00:33:56,715 --> 00:34:00,008
Come in and close the door, mister.

445
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:05,214
Why, Mr. Van Meer. It isn't possible.

446
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,602
I've just been given a drug.

447
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:12,125
Drug of some sort.

448
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,223
But I saw you shot just outside
the conference hall. I saw it!

449
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,555
They gave it to me...

450
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,012
when they moved me from...

451
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,371
It's beginning now.

452
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,935
But the man I saw shot was a dead image.

453
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:30,383
The man you saw shot, it wasrt me.

454
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,005
He was a...

455
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:36,815
substitute that looked like me.

456
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:38,258
But why? What...

457
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:41,736
They want the world to think...

458
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:46,089
that I've been assassinated. Yes.

459
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,060
To conceal the fact...

460
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:53,921
- that I'm in their hands.
- Their hands? Who are they?

461
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,703
I can't explain.

462
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,197
I'm not certain.

463
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:05,085
This drug. I can hardly think.

464
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:09,921
All that I can tell you...

465
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:13,463
is that they are going
to take me away by plane...

466
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:16,412
like a bird.

467
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:20,213
Always there are places in the city...

468
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,832
where birds can get crumbs.

469
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,083
Birds.

470
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,120
Quick.

471
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,097
A pencil.

472
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,982
Give me the pen.

473
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:13,902
See? Old mill.

474
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,340
Up the road.

475
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,668
Look.

476
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:20,650
Man.

477
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,917
Old mill. Understand?

478
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:28,612
- Does anyone here speak English?
- We speak English in the school.

479
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,693
Why have you been holding out on me?

480
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:33,481
Look, tell these two policemen
to come with me.

481
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:36,862
Very, very important.
Big old prisoner. Old mill.

482
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,431
Tell them to follow me.
Do you understand?

483
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:56,215
Yeah. That's what
I've been trying to tell you. Come on.

484
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,321
They've gone.

485
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,548
They've killed him.

486
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,244
But it isn't...

487
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:42,723
Who are you?

488
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,791
Where are the others?

489
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,396
There's been a frame-up.
Ask him where the others have gone.

490
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:04,404
He doesn't know what you're
talking about. There are no other people.

491
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:06,511
And in any case,
he's been asleep here all day.

492
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,331
He's lying. I talked to Van Meer
in this very room.

493
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:20,998
There's one thing I can show you.
The assassins' car. The one we followed.

494
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:32,258
Rather a unique specimen, old boy.
The only one horsepower car in the world.

495
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,400
I don't care what you say.
That car was here.

496
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:38,211
Listen, I know I look a fool,
but there's something fishy going on.

497
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:40,861
There's a big story in this.
I can smell it, I can feel it.

498
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,418
I'll get to the bottom of it,
if it's the last thing I do.

499
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,562
Nothing's going to stop me.
Do you understand?

500
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:49,559
I'll prove that that wasrt Van Meer
that was assassinated, but his double.

501
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,350
Who is it?

502
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:15,275
All right. Come in.

503
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:23,172
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes.

504
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:26,018
What are you, the house detective?
You werert announced.

505
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,437
- I'm sorry, sir. We asked at the desk.
- Policemen?

506
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:31,845
You're not here
to apologize about the windmill?

507
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:36,032
We simply want you to come with us
and tell your story to our chief of police.

508
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,360
Does this chief of police speak English,
because I'm a very busy man.

509
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:42,840
It will take no more than half an hour.
We all speak English.

510
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:45,780
That's marvelous. That's more
than I can say for my country.

511
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,374
Would you sit down?
I have to make a phone call.

512
00:42:48,445 --> 00:42:50,266
Dinner date with a young lady.

513
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,921
The exchange doesn't answer.
I'll call later.

514
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:10,095
Look, I'm a very quick bather.

515
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:13,574
Would you excuse me while I
jump in the tub and have a quick shave?

516
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,012
Look at some magazines. I'll be right back.

517
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:18,313
You can't you bring
the chief of police here?

518
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,997
- No, I am afraid not.
- I thought not.

519
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:31,391
Please don't bother to come.

520
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,946
You'll find it on my dressing table.

521
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,052
- We meet again.
- So it seems.

522
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,408
Quite a lot's happened
since I last saw you.

523
00:44:55,477 --> 00:44:56,721
So I see.

524
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:01,359
I had quite a chase
after that guy outside Amsterdam.

525
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,522
It's quite a country.
It's interesting. Windmills and tulips.

526
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:06,413
Did you find everything you...

527
00:45:08,366 --> 00:45:11,943
We were just talking about the tulips.
Don't seem to be any.

528
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,595
I really think I should be going now.

529
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:17,982
Thank you very much for the powder.

530
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:19,908
Must you really go now?

531
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:22,527
Yes, I must be going now. Really.

532
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:27,325
Goodbye.

533
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:35,672
You've made quite a day of it,
haven't you?

534
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:38,905
Making fools of Scott ffolliott and me,
breaking into my bedroom...

535
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:41,241
and disgracing me
before a friend of my father's.

536
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:44,273
What are your plans now?
You might at least have clothes on.

537
00:45:44,346 --> 00:45:46,766
Take it easy. This is serious.
I've got to talk to you.

538
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:49,589
I've seen your serious business.
What're you doing here?

539
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:51,377
- I'm escaping.
- Escaping from what?

540
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,354
From some fellows
in my room about to kill me.

541
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:54,605
May I ask who?

542
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:57,708
Two gentlemen disguised as policemen,
waiting to take me for a ride.

543
00:45:57,778 --> 00:46:01,159
- You're talking through your hat.
- I'm not talking through my hat.

544
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:04,198
I've thrown a monkey wrench
into some international dirty business.

545
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:06,658
I know Van Meer's alive.
That's why want to kill me.

546
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:08,042
I can think of others.

547
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:10,180
You've got to help me.
Not for my sake alone...

548
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:11,810
but it's the biggest story in Europe.

549
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:15,655
Your childish mind is out of place
in Europe as you are in my bedroom.

550
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:18,108
Get over there.

551
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:36,315
You see what you're doing?

552
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,575
All this is going back to London
and will be common gossip by tomorrow.

553
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:42,488
I don't care for myself,
but my father's engaged in great work.

554
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:44,340
He's trying to help avert a dreadful war...

555
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:46,862
and this is just the sort of thing
to discredit him.

556
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,559
I know you care nothing about our work.

557
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,693
All you're interested in is having fun
with windmills and bathrooms.

558
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:53,355
You don't believe I'm in trouble?

559
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:55,498
You'll be in lot of trouble
if you don't get out.

560
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,870
Now for the last time, please go.

561
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:05,834
Okay. But I want you to know exactly
what's going to happen when I do go.

562
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:08,800
I'll go back to my room
and try and shake those fellows off...

563
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:10,018
but I won't succeed.

564
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:13,121
They'll stick to me like a
couple of tattoo marks until they get me.

565
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:16,986
They'll stop at nothing. I seem to know
too much. And you're right.

566
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:19,427
I don't know much about
your crackpot peace movement...

567
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:22,752
I don't know what's wrong with Europe.
But I know a story when I see one.

568
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:26,165
I'll keep after it until either I get it
or it gets me.

569
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:29,150
Sorry you have those
derogatory opinions of me...

570
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,220
but I guess that can't be helped.

571
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:35,312
So long. It's been nice knowing you.

572
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,877
I said goodbye.

573
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,366
Don't go.

574
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:54,603
I guess I could have handled those fellows
with a little luck.

575
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,125
We mustrt take any chances.
We should get help.

576
00:47:57,198 --> 00:47:58,659
That's what I had in mind.

577
00:47:58,734 --> 00:48:02,441
- I'll get Dr. Williamson...
- Wait. They might not understand.

578
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:05,253
They have understood.

579
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:14,747
We could catch the night boat to England
if we could get out.

580
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,753
That's the hitch.
What's that friend's name, that "ff"?

581
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:20,575
- Ffolliott.
- Get me Mr. Ffolliott's room, please.

582
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,652
Left the hotel?

583
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,053
That's strange.
We were to dine together tonight.

584
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:28,793
- He realized how much I meant to you.
- You'd mean more with your clothes on.

585
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,103
You like the intellectual type.

586
00:48:30,171 --> 00:48:31,926
- Say, I've got an idea.
- What?

587
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:34,481
Give me the manager, please.
Buzz for the valet.

588
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:38,163
Is this the manager?
This is Mr. Haverstock in 537.

589
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:39,921
What kind of hotel is this?

590
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,836
My bathtub leaks, phone's out of order,
and I've been robbed.

591
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,866
Will you send somebody up right away?
Thank you.

592
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,871
Operator, send a waiter up to 537.

593
00:48:49,937 --> 00:48:52,586
And ask the chambermaid
to bring up some clean sheets.

594
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:53,898
I've set mine on fire.

595
00:48:53,966 --> 00:48:55,972
And I'd like my windows cleaned.

596
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,971
And ask boots to come get my shoes.
Hurry up. That's a good girl.

597
00:49:00,043 --> 00:49:02,976
Clutter up that room nicely
for those two guys.

598
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:05,438
It's the valet. Come in.

599
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:07,840
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sir.

600
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,916
Go to my room, 537...

601
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,955
and get me shirt, tie, suit, and a hat.

602
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,719
You see, my husband's
waiting in the room for this gentleman.

603
00:50:35,924 --> 00:50:39,271
No sign of them yet.
Let's hide ourselves in the cabin.

604
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:47,875
- Full up, sir. Sorry.
- Not even a small cabin?

605
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,566
Not a thing.
Everybody in a hurry to get home.

606
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:53,569
I have a rather rare banknote
you might be interested in.

607
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:56,358
It's a memento,
that is if you collect rare banknotes.

608
00:50:56,425 --> 00:51:00,034
It's no use, sir. I'd do it if I could,
but there just isn't a place left.

609
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:03,646
On English ships, you come up against
such an air of incorruptibility.

610
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:06,814
As a matter of fact,
I've just had a cabin returned.

611
00:51:06,883 --> 00:51:08,540
Can I have your name, sir?

612
00:51:09,218 --> 00:51:12,347
One cabin isn't going to do us much good.
We just can't...

613
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:15,610
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge.
I hope you didn't think I...

614
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:18,360
No, of course not. It's very kind of you.

615
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,085
I'll take it.

616
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:22,575
I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid it's too late now.

617
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,609
You had some doubt about taking it,
so I had to let that gentleman have it.

618
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,711
That's too bad. It's such a rare 5 note.

619
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:32,650
The water mark's upside down.
I think you'd have loved it.

620
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:34,610
Well, perhaps next time.

621
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:16,594
- Were you really going to tip that man 5?
- Of course.

622
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,935
I charge all my traveling expenses
to the office.

623
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,692
Corrupting an official, 5.

624
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:23,345
You're just a wee bit unscrupulous,
aren't you?

625
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:25,618
Not unscrupulous. Just in love.

626
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:29,320
- It's the same thing, I suppose.
- I beg your pardon?

627
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,153
I beg yours.

628
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:34,567
You see, I love you,
and I want to marry you.

629
00:52:37,711 --> 00:52:40,165
I love you, and I want to marry you.

630
00:52:41,165 --> 00:52:44,459
That cuts our love scene down
quite a bit, doesn't it?

631
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:47,489
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. It's made a new man of me.

632
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:49,186
I hope not entirely new.

633
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:52,572
It took me some time
to get used to the first man you were.

634
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:55,907
To be perfectly frank with you,
I expected a little more argument.

635
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,874
I'm really left with quite a few things
I very much wanted to say.

636
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:02,241
Save them until after we're married.
I imagine they'll sound better then.

637
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,376
I've saved things to say then, too.

638
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,836
You were really quite sure of yourself,
werert you?

639
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:10,204
I didn't think I had a chance.
A guy's got a right to dream, hasn't he?

640
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:11,446
Evidently.

641
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,197
Do you think your father will understand?

642
00:53:14,266 --> 00:53:16,883
I think that Father
will be delighted, frankly.

643
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:37,536
All right, sir.

644
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,441
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Stiles, this is Mr. Haverstock.

645
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,969
- Is Father up yet?
- Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.

646
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,153
Come on.

647
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,562
- Hello, Father.
- What on earth are you doing in London?

648
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:02,968
Mr. Haverstock brought me back
on the boat.

649
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,611
- You're not ill? You look healthy.
- I'm fine. It's Mr. Haverstock.

650
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:08,534
I hope you don't mind my barging in.

651
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,421
On the contrary, I'm delighted to see you.

652
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:13,899
You cover a lot of territory, don't you?
You didn't even wire me.

653
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:16,240
For that I hope
your trip was uncomfortable.

654
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:17,484
It wasrt so bad.

655
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,480
The boat was crowded, we couldn't get
any cabins, but we slept on the deck.

656
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:23,623
<i>Monsieur Krug, how nice to see you again.</i>

657
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,443
<i>But you haven't met
Mr. Haverstock, Monsieur Krug.</i>

658
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:30,723
<i>Monsieur Krug is a member
of the Baruvian embassy staff.</i>

659
00:54:30,795 --> 00:54:33,030
Sit down, Haverstock. Have breakfast.

660
00:54:33,098 --> 00:54:35,813
I should tidy up, but I'm simply starved.

661
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:42,365
So you were in Amsterdam
yesterday, Mr. Haverstock.

662
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:45,053
Poor Van Meer.
His death is a personal loss.

663
00:54:45,123 --> 00:54:46,977
Of all people, why Van Meer?

664
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:50,269
You can't ask why with assassins.
There's no logic in killing.

665
00:54:50,335 --> 00:54:53,149
We can't spare such men
in a world like ours.

666
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:56,020
Did you by any chance
meet him, Mr. Haverstock?

667
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,636
- Not formally, but I saw him die.
- Horrible.

668
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:04,406
As a matter of fact, I chased the man
that shot him, and almost caught him.

669
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,772
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman.

670
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:08,693
That'd be quite a coup...

671
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:11,755
bringing in your first story
wrapped around an assassin.

672
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:17,000
I think I shall have to be
getting along now, Mr. Fisher.

673
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,515
Shall we write the peace petition now
or leave it for later?

674
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,589
We may as well do it straightaway,
in the study. Excuse us.

675
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:27,139
Father, could I speak to you for a moment?
It's terribly important.

676
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,737
This won't take a moment.

677
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:32,157
Meanwhile, see if you can interest
Mr. Haverstock in some eggs and bacon.

678
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:34,173
Mr. Fisher. What's that man doing here?

679
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,424
<i>Why, it's Monsieur Krug.</i>

680
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:37,500
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- I just read...

681
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:41,084
That was his double that was shot.
Van Meer was kidnapped. I talked to him.

682
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,681
<i>What has Monsieur Krug to do with it?</i>

683
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:44,760
Remember my description
of the man in the mill?

684
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,068
You mean the sweater. Of course.

685
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,305
<i>That's impossible.
We've known Monsieur Krug...</i>

686
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:52,853
Krug brought Van Meer here last night.
He's in England. They're hiding him.

687
00:55:52,924 --> 00:55:54,385
- You're positive?
- Of course.

688
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:56,280
I was as close to Krug as I am to you now.

689
00:55:56,346 --> 00:55:59,541
It'd be terrible if we made a mistake.
But we can't allow him to...

690
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:01,069
Leave it to me.

691
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:09,963
I don't want to be inospitable,
but leave my house.

692
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:13,546
Mr. Haverstock will suggest
that I turn you over to the police.

693
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:16,811
Mr. Haverstock seems to be
something of a troublemaker.

694
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,844
You said he'd been taken care of
by our agents in Amsterdam.

695
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:23,046
I thought so, too. I don't understand it.

696
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,833
Unless, perhaps,
Miss Fisher's being with him...

697
00:56:25,898 --> 00:56:27,751
may have caused complications.

698
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:30,528
It would've been ideal
if she'd been in our confidences.

699
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,445
- Please leave my daughter out of it.
- I beg your pardon.

700
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:35,101
Most unfortunate, his coming here.

701
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:38,716
I've never had to cope with this
sort of thing before, thanks to you, Krug.

702
00:56:38,787 --> 00:56:41,120
Someone has to take care
of the sordid details.

703
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:43,289
This is close to home.
In fact, it is my home.

704
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,227
After all, I'm only a politician. In a sense.

705
00:56:47,326 --> 00:56:50,172
And politicians aren't usually
called upon to...

706
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,012
do away with their guests, are they?

707
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:54,803
Quiet, boy.

708
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:56,814
Not in the house. No, sir.

709
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:58,797
But I have an idea.

710
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:07,948
- Do you remember Rowley?
- Rowley?

711
00:57:08,434 --> 00:57:12,010
Yes. The little man that used to work
at your father's stables in Austria.

712
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,819
I seem to recall he was present
when a mutual friend of ours...

713
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:18,761
accidentally fell off
the high bridge at Bern.

714
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:20,104
He's retired now.

715
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,558
Lives somewhere in Clapham,
here in London.

716
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:24,743
If Mr. Haverstock could be induced...

717
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,556
to hire him in the capacity
of a private detective.

718
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,088
What for?

719
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:32,702
You should warn him
that it's very dangerous for him...

720
00:57:32,772 --> 00:57:35,869
to go about London
with the knowledge that he has.

721
00:57:36,962 --> 00:57:38,521
Yes, I see.

722
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,294
You use the English language
with great delicacy.

723
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,740
Thank you, sir.

724
00:57:43,805 --> 00:57:46,902
I shall look Mr. Rowley up at once
and give him his instructions.

725
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:49,331
You mustrt. It would be too dangerous.

726
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:54,127
What do we do now, call Scotland Yard?

727
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,053
<i>I thought it best to send
Monsieur Krug away.</i>

728
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:57,743
You let him get away? Listen...

729
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:59,406
If what you say is true...

730
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,996
then it's important not to rouse
Krug's suspicions.

731
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,683
- Van Meer will be killed.
- Dead or alive, it's a story.

732
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:06,247
Johnny, father's right.

733
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,799
- Okay. I'll cable them what I've got.
- I wouldn't, if I were you.

734
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:13,164
Van Meer's life may depend on
our keeping this quiet a few hours.

735
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:14,569
Keep it quiet?

736
00:58:15,211 --> 00:58:18,755
A famous diplomat's kidnapped right
under my eyes and I muzzle myself?

737
00:58:18,826 --> 00:58:21,280
I'm sorry, but this is a story
with facts in it.

738
00:58:21,353 --> 00:58:24,929
This is the kind of story I'm here to get,
the kind America's waiting for.

739
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:27,517
It'll be a bigger story if you can
wait a few hours...

740
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:31,612
until we find Van Meer and discover
what's behind this curious business.

741
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,110
I know what's behind it.

742
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:36,315
I don't mean who is behind it.
I mean the why of it.

743
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:39,677
Would you get me
all my correspondence with Krug?

744
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:43,866
Do what Father says.
It'll be best for you and Mr. Van Meer.

745
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,322
Okay. I'll wait.

746
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:51,634
I'm worried about you, Mr. Haverstock.

747
00:58:51,703 --> 00:58:53,775
I'm worried about myself.
I feel weak-minded.

748
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:57,073
You're right. I don't like you dashing about
without some protection.

749
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,408
- Forget it.
- Lf you're right, you need protection.

750
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:02,026
I've covered beer mob killings
and race riots...

751
00:59:02,097 --> 00:59:04,333
without even carrying a rabbit's foot.

752
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,741
These people are criminals...

753
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,555
more dangerous than your rumrunners
and house-breakers.

754
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:09,962
They're fanatics.

755
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:13,824
They combine a mad love of country
with an equally mad indifference to life...

756
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:16,036
their own, as well as others'.

757
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:20,702
They're cunning, unscrupulous
and inspired.

758
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:27,198
I couldn't face Mr. Powers again
if you didn't live long enough...

759
00:59:27,267 --> 00:59:29,785
to turn in the best story of the year.

760
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:32,789
I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent
hiding in an attic.

761
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:36,473
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere.
Just get somebody to protect you.

762
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:39,159
A nurse? Johnny Jones goes to Europe
and hires a nurse.

763
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:41,943
That's going to look great
on the expense account.

764
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,936
I know a very efficient detective agency
where we can get just the man.

765
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:49,138
- Okay. Whatever you say.
- I can arrange it for you.

766
00:59:50,198 --> 00:59:52,684
If you'll feel better, I won't mention it
to anybody.

767
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:57,063
Mention it. If anyone finds out I've hired
a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.

768
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:11,396
If that's Mr. Rowley,
tell him to wait outside.

769
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:16,128
I've called on Mr. Haverstock.
Will you tell him Mr. Rowley's here.

770
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,564
- Yes. Will you wait here, please?
- Thank you.

771
01:00:20,644 --> 01:00:23,457
- Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.
- Where are you going?

772
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,456
- To the office, I've got work to do.
- You mustrt go.

773
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:30,139
I was sent over here at great expense
as a newspaperman, not a refugee.

774
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:32,955
- How about lunch at the Savoy?
- I'll see you out.

775
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,587
- Johnny, please be careful.
- I'll be all right.

776
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,772
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Is this the man?

777
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:47,569
Look, who's protecting who?

778
01:00:47,638 --> 01:00:49,676
I ain't lanky, but I'm quick.

779
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:51,983
You understand what you have to do?

780
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,798
You can trust me to take good care
of Mr. Haverstock.

781
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:57,864
- Are we going now, sir?
- Take me to my office in Fleet Street...

782
01:00:57,936 --> 01:01:01,098
- and if you're good, to the American Club.
- Right, sir.

783
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,953
You'll keep after this other thing?

784
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,466
When there's any definite news
of our friend, you can break the story.

785
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,261
Goodbye.

786
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,075
Why, Carol.

787
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,522
Nothing must happen to him, Father.
I just couldn't...

788
01:01:24,672 --> 01:01:25,849
How do we go, sir?

789
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,234
Should I walk a little behind you,
or beside you, like a friend?

790
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:32,373
- What's the custom?
- People have different tastes.

791
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:35,508
When I served the Duke of Albertson,
a democratic sort of gent...

792
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:38,424
I used to walk alongside of him,
man-to-man like.

793
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:41,105
I once had a lady who thought
that was disrespectful.

794
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:43,856
"Three paces behind," she said.
"And don't smoke."

795
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:46,923
What's good for a duke is good enough
for me. We can be a team.

796
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:50,605
Thank you. If we want to go to
the American Club, we'd better take a cab.

797
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,949
There's one.

798
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:54,663
What's the trouble, sir?
Gangsters after you?

799
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:55,880
Not exactly.

800
01:01:55,951 --> 01:01:59,723
We're not afraid of gangsters here.
Even our police don't carry guns.

801
01:01:59,788 --> 01:02:02,470
- What do they do?
- Biff you over the head with a stick.

802
01:02:02,538 --> 01:02:03,847
It's more healthy-like.

803
01:02:10,342 --> 01:02:13,156
Did you see that?
Someone deliberately pushed me.

804
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:16,034
That was me. If I'd pulled you back,
you'd have been caught.

805
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,414
- It was push or nothing.
- That's smart work, Mr. Rowley.

806
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:22,139
- Thank you very much.
- That's what I'm here for.

807
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,320
Taxi!

808
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,874
- American Club.
- Yes, sir.

809
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:31,415
After you, sir.

810
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:41,618
I'm not certain, sir...

811
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:45,228
but I've got an idea two men
took another cab to follow us.

812
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:49,261
- I don't see anyone suspicious.
- I may have been mistaken...

813
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:51,885
but I'm almost certain I saw them.

814
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:57,412
They may have heard where we're going.

815
01:02:57,995 --> 01:02:59,107
Driver.

816
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:04,262
Go down Victoria Street,
round past Buckingham Palace.

817
01:03:04,328 --> 01:03:05,636
Right, sir.

818
01:03:05,735 --> 01:03:08,733
We might give them the slip
if we go the long way around.

819
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:13,918
I'm afraid they're still after us.

820
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:17,530
Our best plan is to pull around
the corner and change cabs.

821
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:20,638
Driver, take the first to your left
and pull up.

822
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:22,262
We're going to walk a bit.

823
01:03:29,082 --> 01:03:32,212
I'll do it, sir. I understand the money.
It'll be quicker.

824
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,457
Thank you, sir.

825
01:03:36,373 --> 01:03:39,055
I think our best plan
is to slip into the cathedral for a bit.

826
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:42,570
Let's stop this ducking out of sight.
Let them catch up and have a showdown.

827
01:03:42,642 --> 01:03:46,218
No, I wouldn't cause a scene.
Our job is to give them the slip.

828
01:03:46,288 --> 01:03:47,880
All right. Let's go.

829
01:03:48,334 --> 01:03:50,537
Nice bit of architecture, sir.

830
01:04:16,095 --> 01:04:17,850
Do you want to go right in?

831
01:04:17,918 --> 01:04:21,081
I saw on the notice it was a requiem mass.
A mass for the dead.

832
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,847
That sort of thing always depresses me,
praying for the dead.

833
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:27,125
The dead are all right in their place...

834
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:30,322
but the music and candles
always give me the creeps.

835
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,390
Just really, sir.
I could be so frightened, sir, I...

836
01:04:38,226 --> 01:04:41,802
How about a trip up top, sir?
That'd really put them off the scent.

837
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,682
Boys, careful there.

838
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,895
- I can't see.
- Here, here.

839
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,612
There you are, my boy!

840
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:23,991
Look. There it goes. There!
I'll have to buy you another now.

841
01:05:25,943 --> 01:05:26,990
Love a duck!

842
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:28,371
Careful, boys.

843
01:05:29,366 --> 01:05:31,339
You better be careful, too, sir.

844
01:05:36,338 --> 01:05:38,246
Not yet, boys. Come.

845
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,026
Let's leave. I have a luncheon date
and plenty to do before.

846
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:48,612
I've got it in mind, don't you worry.
Really, now. Look.

847
01:05:48,682 --> 01:05:53,023
Isn't it won'thwhile coming up here?
There's the Houses of Parliament there.

848
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:56,411
And there's St. James' Park.
That green patch. Yeah.

849
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:58,012
Come along, boys.

850
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:08,025
You must excuse me getting scared
when you leaned over just now, sir.

851
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:10,745
I was once with a man on a bridge
in Switzerland.

852
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:12,914
He had a very nasty fall.

853
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:16,374
Killed him. Stone dead.

854
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,561
Always made me a bit nervous since.

855
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:39,208
Don't go down just yet, sir.
I'd like you to see St. Paul's.

856
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:41,607
There it is, just coming out of the mist.

857
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:45,384
There's the horse guards approaching
Buckingham Palace. See them?

858
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,158
It makes the back of me legs go funny.
Heights always did.

859
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:50,789
Let's get down again, Eric.

860
01:06:50,855 --> 01:06:53,058
We've just come up.
Why didn't you say so before?

861
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:55,012
Excuse me. I know just how you feel.

862
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,010
Them as has no head for heights.
Nobody ought not to blame them.

863
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,708
What's it got to do with you?

864
01:06:59,778 --> 01:07:02,940
All right, keep your hair on.
I was only sympathizing with the lady.

865
01:07:03,008 --> 01:07:04,829
- I'm going.
- Wait for the lift.

866
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:05,877
No.

867
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:14,227
No stairs for me.
I'm going to take the elevator.

868
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:17,966
Wait a minute, sir.
You ain't seen the horse guards yet.

869
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:21,813
You must see the horse guards, sir.

870
01:07:22,933 --> 01:07:26,314
- Where? I don't see anything.
- Why, there they are, sir.

871
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:31,047
Down the road. Just going towards...

872
01:07:32,144 --> 01:07:33,801
the white building.

873
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:47,328
No, boys. This way.

874
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:09,880
There but for the grace of God.

875
01:08:09,947 --> 01:08:13,360
I still don't know what instinct made me
step aside when he came at me.

876
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:14,894
You need a drink.

877
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:17,649
I heard the lift coming up, and I turned.

878
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:20,204
I saw that look in his eyes
as he came toward me.

879
01:08:20,277 --> 01:08:23,275
That split second, the whole thing
flashed through my mind.

880
01:08:23,347 --> 01:08:26,760
All I could think of was Fisher.
Fisher planned this.

881
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:31,078
Then I guess I just stepped aside
and over he went.

882
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:34,313
- Over he went all right. You want this?
- No, thanks.

883
01:08:34,956 --> 01:08:37,507
When are you going to send the story
to the gazette?

884
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:38,854
When I get ready.

885
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:42,334
There goes another one of my illusions.

886
01:08:42,408 --> 01:08:45,254
I thought you were one of the journalists
nothing could stop.

887
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:48,219
Floods, smallpox, love:
The story must go on.

888
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:49,437
It'll go on.

889
01:08:50,947 --> 01:08:51,895
No.

890
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:55,008
I can understand you not wanting
to drag Miss Fisher into it...

891
01:08:55,073 --> 01:08:57,210
but she's probably in it already.

892
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:59,446
- The moll of the gang.
- You dirty...

893
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:02,484
On second thought,
I'm sure she's a fine girl...

894
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:04,563
upstanding, honest, and a great soul.

895
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:07,090
I can't send the story over
until Van Meer's safe.

896
01:09:07,162 --> 01:09:08,722
We got to find Van Meer first.

897
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:12,592
There's our man now, probably.
Mr. Van Meer, come in.

898
01:09:14,294 --> 01:09:16,747
Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?

899
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,633
Congratulations on your little set-to
with Rowley.

900
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:22,858
What do you know about Rowley?

901
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:25,742
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.
Probably knows about Fisher.

902
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:27,715
I was onto Fisher a year ago.

903
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:31,050
The fellow with the high neck sweater,
Krug, he's new to me.

904
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:33,254
- You're onto him, too?
- I followed him to London.

905
01:09:33,324 --> 01:09:37,511
- I thought you were cold on this story.
- I've been doing some noticing.

906
01:09:37,576 --> 01:09:40,477
Remember that tramp
you found asleep in the mill?

907
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,011
He wasrt a tramp at all.

908
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:44,540
- Van Meer, I suppose.
- Not quite.

909
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,978
But I notice him do
a strange thing for a tramp.

910
01:09:47,044 --> 01:09:50,424
He dirtied his hands
with some of that nasty Dutch soil.

911
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,593
I can't follow the workings
of these masterminds.

912
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:57,501
No. Tell him it's ridiculous.

913
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:01,940
You'd already disappeared,
so I followed Krug...

914
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:03,700
but found the same old mousetrap.

915
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,874
- You mean Fisher?
- The good, kind...

916
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:08,726
<i>genial head of the Peace Party,
Herr Fisher.</i>

917
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:12,594
Hello, Eddy. This is Plunger Stebbins.

918
01:10:12,661 --> 01:10:15,627
I want to place a bet on
Flibbertigibbet in the first race...

919
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:19,242
What? The race is over?
Okay, I'll call you later.

920
01:10:19,888 --> 01:10:22,636
Any objection to our working
this thing together?

921
01:10:22,703 --> 01:10:24,590
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer?

922
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:27,718
Fine, but I'd like to know
why they kidnapped Van Meer.

923
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:30,504
He was one of the signatories
to a certain treaty.

924
01:10:30,571 --> 01:10:32,958
The most important clause
was never written down...

925
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:34,942
just memorized by the two signatories.

926
01:10:35,016 --> 01:10:36,641
And they'll beat it out of him?

927
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,557
They'll try hard, and we should stop them.

928
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:42,654
It contains a piece of information
very valuable to the enemy...

929
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:45,243
in the war that starts tomorrow,
weather permitting.

930
01:10:45,314 --> 01:10:49,022
What? Why didn't somebody
let me in on this? Stebbins, let's get busy.

931
01:10:49,088 --> 01:10:50,516
Plenty of time. Lunch first.

932
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:52,662
Wait a minute. You might be of help.

933
01:10:52,734 --> 01:10:55,864
I thought up a little plan
for forcing Fisher's hand.

934
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:57,045
Let's have it.

935
01:10:57,115 --> 01:11:00,725
The neatest thing to do
would be to kidnap Fisher's daughter.

936
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:02,640
Yeah?

937
01:11:02,712 --> 01:11:05,428
One of his few genuine traces of affection
is for Miss Fisher.

938
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:07,566
Easy. You're speaking to a man in love.

939
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:11,530
Good. Gives you a chance to get chummy,
to keep her happy at your side...

940
01:11:11,603 --> 01:11:14,504
while we batter old Papa.
This is my little scheme.

941
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,892
I let Fisher know that his daughter is
in the hands of someone...

942
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:20,683
who means business just as he does
when he kidnaps people...

943
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,789
- and he'll see things our way.
- Nothing doing.

944
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,289
Arert you a newspaperman?

945
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:28,388
- That doesn't include kidnapping fiances.
- It would, if your country were at stake.

946
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:31,108
- This isn't my country.
- It's your story. Don't be gloomy.

947
01:11:31,177 --> 01:11:33,957
She doesn't have to know
what you're doing. Keep her amused.

948
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:36,061
Why not grab Fisher, have a showdown?

949
01:11:36,134 --> 01:11:38,467
That's no good.
We've got nothing on Fisher.

950
01:11:38,532 --> 01:11:42,872
He'd slip out of it. He has been for years.
We'd merely kill Van Meer.

951
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:47,998
Darling, are you all right?
Why were you on the tower?

952
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,884
Keeping safe, I thought.

953
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,796
Those assassins followed,
there was a scuffle, and over he went.

954
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,916
They won't stop till they get you.
You must leave London immediately.

955
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,766
The one thing everybody forgets
is that I'm a reporter.

956
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:06,219
- And there's a war. I can't run from it.
- He can't stay here.

957
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:09,673
- Tell him how desperate they are.
- Don't stay here, why don't you take him?

958
01:12:09,747 --> 01:12:10,761
I won't go.

959
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:13,352
Isn't there some maiden aunt
in the country?

960
01:12:13,424 --> 01:12:17,099
- My Aunt Margaret. Let me take you there.
- How about it?

961
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,361
- Stay out of this.
- It's the only sensible thing to do.

962
01:12:20,588 --> 01:12:22,497
May I use your telephone?

963
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:31,843
Hello, Stiles. Miss Carol speaking.

964
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:35,323
Please tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving
to my Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.

965
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:39,288
- I don't care what you arrange. I won't go.
- I'll be back for dinner. Thank you.

966
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:42,589
- It's all settled. We'll get you a toothbrush.
- Carol, it's no good.

967
01:12:42,656 --> 01:12:44,923
I wonder if this idea of your aunt
is so good.

968
01:12:44,991 --> 01:12:47,094
Maybe you should go further,
say, Cambridge.

969
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:49,074
No place is as obscure as Harpenden.

970
01:12:49,148 --> 01:12:52,376
It's not the place, but that Krug
might connect you with it.

971
01:12:52,442 --> 01:12:56,334
- Maybe so. Let's make it Cambridge.
- I'll phone your father so he doesn't worry.

972
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:58,578
Thank you. Please, Johnny.

973
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:13,161
That was a break, her coming,
and suggesting they go to the country.

974
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:14,986
As a matter of fact, old boy...

975
01:13:15,054 --> 01:13:18,500
I suggested it to her on the phone
about half an hour ago.

976
01:13:26,663 --> 01:13:30,010
There hasn't been a sign of anybody
for the last 30 miles.

977
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,859
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

978
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,699
At least talk to me.
It's unfair of you to sit and pout...

979
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,485
because I've kidnapped you
from your so-called duties.

980
01:13:39,552 --> 01:13:41,209
You've kidnapped me?

981
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:43,001
Just remember that.

982
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,443
Please forgive me.

983
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:47,736
Sure. I don't think kidnapping's anything
to get sore about...

984
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,452
- when the right kidnapper does it. Do you?
- Not at all.

985
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:51,249
Thanks.

986
01:13:58,485 --> 01:13:59,597
Hello?

987
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:03,754
No, Mr. Ffolliott, I'm afraid he's not in yet.

988
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,933
Very well, sir.

989
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:19,970
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy.

990
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,487
- You looked unappy kissing me.
- Never happier in my life.

991
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,826
Wort do. Johnny, what's happened?

992
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:28,707
I don't know.
They say war's coming tomorrow.

993
01:14:28,772 --> 01:14:31,258
You've changed your philosophy
since yesterday.

994
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,630
There are more important things
than love.

995
01:14:33,697 --> 01:14:36,216
I've got lots to do, important things.

996
01:14:36,448 --> 01:14:38,780
Got to start.
It'll take three hours to get back.

997
01:14:38,846 --> 01:14:42,193
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm so love with you, I'm going mad.

998
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:44,656
Wort do. I guess it can't be helped.

999
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:47,729
- You've turned European overnight.
- That's unfair.

1000
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:50,734
I'm just as big a jackass as ever. Bigger.

1001
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,456
You're not going back to London to dinner.

1002
01:14:53,526 --> 01:14:56,045
You can't run out on your kidnapper.

1003
01:14:56,436 --> 01:14:58,922
I mean, you know what I mean.

1004
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:03,367
If you leave, I'll go back to London
and let them bump me off.

1005
01:15:04,368 --> 01:15:06,984
- It'll be a relief at that.
- You are moody.

1006
01:15:07,822 --> 01:15:09,512
Am I the cause of it?

1007
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,564
If you knew how much I loved you,
you'd faint.

1008
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,320
There. What'd I tell you?

1009
01:15:25,763 --> 01:15:26,875
Come in.

1010
01:15:27,426 --> 01:15:28,636
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes?

1011
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:29,785
Call from London.

1012
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:33,150
- Have them switch it here.
- The only phone here is in the office.

1013
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:34,676
All right. I'll come down.

1014
01:15:35,486 --> 01:15:37,656
Forgive me for a moment, dear.

1015
01:15:44,217 --> 01:15:45,874
Just a moment, sir.

1016
01:15:52,596 --> 01:15:55,050
- Hello?
- Is that you, Haverstock?

1017
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:58,350
Are you alone? Can you talk?
I can't reach Fisher.

1018
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:00,334
He's been out all afternoon.

1019
01:16:01,007 --> 01:16:04,202
You'll have to keep the girl there
much longer than we planned.

1020
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:07,083
I don't know when he'll return.
I've got to catch him alone.

1021
01:16:07,148 --> 01:16:09,154
Better keep her there
for the rest of the night.

1022
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:11,525
That's absolutely impossible.

1023
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:14,182
We can't let this thing go now.

1024
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,820
I can't very well explain,
but I couldn't pull a thing like that.

1025
01:16:18,885 --> 01:16:22,232
There's nothing else to be done.
I'm counting on you.

1026
01:16:23,267 --> 01:16:24,314
Hello?

1027
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:39,443
Are you quite satisfied
with your room, sir?

1028
01:16:39,514 --> 01:16:42,774
Not exactly. I mean, yes...

1029
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,424
But what I really wanted
was another room as well.

1030
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:46,867
A single room.

1031
01:16:49,236 --> 01:16:52,234
Mr. Naysmith, this gentleman wants
another room.

1032
01:16:52,562 --> 01:16:55,113
Is it for the lady
and how long do you need it?

1033
01:16:55,184 --> 01:16:57,801
She'll only be here just the one night.

1034
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:03,713
- The gentleman has Number 7.
- What about Number 8?

1035
01:17:03,788 --> 01:17:07,942
It doesn't really make any difference.
Just a good room, windows and all that.

1036
01:17:08,009 --> 01:17:09,634
I understand.

1037
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:12,703
Perhaps the room next to yours
would be best.

1038
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:15,839
It's quite a cozy room, isn't it, Number 8?

1039
01:17:15,909 --> 01:17:18,875
- They're all alike to me, sir.
- Eight will do.

1040
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,561
Will you bring the lady down
to sign the book, please?

1041
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:23,967
Yes, I'll get her.

1042
01:17:42,486 --> 01:17:44,656
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1043
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:53,100
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man
who was here this morning.

1044
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:56,586
- Yes, terrible. My bags all packed?
- Yes, sir.

1045
01:17:56,654 --> 01:17:58,027
What about Miss Carol's?

1046
01:17:58,093 --> 01:18:01,353
Mrs. Stiles packed hers, too. She hopes
she's put in the right things.

1047
01:18:01,419 --> 01:18:03,873
It's been a rush, as she's not back yet.

1048
01:18:04,362 --> 01:18:06,662
Mr. Ffolliott's waiting in the sitting room.

1049
01:18:07,048 --> 01:18:09,730
Another gentleman phoned,
but wouldn't leave his name.

1050
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:12,895
I thought he sounded
like the foreign gentleman at breakfast.

1051
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:16,035
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes. He said it was urgent.

1052
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:18,519
Well, show Mr. Ffolliott into the study.

1053
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:38,421
- Hello, sir.
- You caught me at a very busy moment.

1054
01:18:38,486 --> 01:18:40,624
I'm going to America tomorrow.

1055
01:18:40,693 --> 01:18:42,219
Are you taking Carol with you?

1056
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:45,770
Yes, she doesn't know yet.
It's been a rush. I'm waiting for her.

1057
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:49,318
Scott, what's your worry?
Must be important.

1058
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,911
Yes, it is rather important.
It's about Carol.

1059
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:54,534
- I'm afraid that...
- What? Anything happen to her?

1060
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,865
No, but I don't think you'll be able to
take her with you to America.

1061
01:18:58,251 --> 01:18:59,428
Why not?

1062
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:03,908
I know it'll sound rather silly to you,
but Carol's been kidnapped.

1063
01:19:04,263 --> 01:19:06,367
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.

1064
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:08,866
What do you mean, kidnapped?

1065
01:19:08,933 --> 01:19:11,517
I happen to know she's with her aunt
in Harpenden.

1066
01:19:11,587 --> 01:19:13,147
I'm afraid she isn't.

1067
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:28,184
Who gave you the message that
Miss Carol's gone to her Aunt Margaret's?

1068
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,874
Miss Carol herself, sir.

1069
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:32,176
Thank you.

1070
01:19:32,728 --> 01:19:34,996
That's where she thought she was going.

1071
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:45,989
Get me Harpenden, 43422.

1072
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:51,945
Hello. Is that you, Margaret?
Is Carol with you?

1073
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,009
No. I wasrt certain.

1074
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:01,218
She said she might run down to see you.

1075
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:03,707
I didn't know whether to expect
her back for dinner.

1076
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,172
All right. Good night, Margaret.

1077
01:20:08,994 --> 01:20:10,423
No, she isn't there.

1078
01:20:12,385 --> 01:20:14,936
What makes you say
she's been kidnapped?

1079
01:20:15,903 --> 01:20:18,836
Sir, I arranged it.

1080
01:20:22,268 --> 01:20:24,950
Ffolliott, this has gone far enough.
Where is Carol?

1081
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:27,981
Carol's being held as a sort of hostage...

1082
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,643
by some people
who are very much in earnest...

1083
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,716
as much in earnest as you are.

1084
01:20:33,205 --> 01:20:36,716
Don't be so cryptic.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.

1085
01:20:39,442 --> 01:20:41,896
I want to know
where you're hiding Van Meer.

1086
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:49,188
So that's it. You've been talking
with that American, Haverstock.

1087
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,975
He told me something about Van Meer
being alive.

1088
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:54,278
You promised Haverstock
you'd look into it.

1089
01:20:54,345 --> 01:20:55,293
Naturally.

1090
01:20:55,368 --> 01:20:58,465
Unusual way of looking into it,
trying to put him out of the way.

1091
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:01,729
I realize a life's a small matter,
the way you work.

1092
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:05,599
The people who've got Carol
can take a leaf out of your book.

1093
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:10,582
Where is she? What've you done with her?

1094
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,116
Where's Van Meer?

1095
01:21:20,314 --> 01:21:21,426
Hello.

1096
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:25,271
I can get our Dutch friend to talk
if you come along yourself.

1097
01:21:25,592 --> 01:21:29,812
Sorry to drag you here, but it's the only
way if you want to leave tomorrow.

1098
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,825
When you get here,
ask at the cashier's desk to use the phone.

1099
01:21:35,282 --> 01:21:36,972
They'll show you straight up.

1100
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,094
I'll drop in as soon as I can.

1101
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:45,065
If you want Carol to go with you,
better tell me where Van Meer is.

1102
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:46,855
Bring her here, I'll give you the address.

1103
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:50,053
Carol can be home in three hours.
I want that address now.

1104
01:21:50,186 --> 01:21:52,606
You can have it as soon as Carol's home.

1105
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,621
I can't possibly wait three hours.

1106
01:21:54,695 --> 01:21:57,410
Besides, I happen to want Van Meer alive.

1107
01:22:26,038 --> 01:22:28,883
- Scott, I delivered him all right.
- Good.

1108
01:22:29,747 --> 01:22:31,568
I think I'll be getting along.

1109
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:34,928
Thanks very much for those points.
Can I take them now?

1110
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,034
Good night, Carol.

1111
01:22:58,403 --> 01:23:01,663
This isn't like you.
What is it that upsets you so?

1112
01:23:01,985 --> 01:23:05,366
I know I'm being silly.
I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.

1113
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:07,091
Please forgive me.

1114
01:23:08,189 --> 01:23:09,563
I wouldn't mind so much...

1115
01:23:09,628 --> 01:23:11,994
but I didn't think
he was that sort of person.

1116
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,846
Something to do with young Haverstock?

1117
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,312
You like him very much.

1118
01:23:19,863 --> 01:23:22,414
After what happened,
I drove him to the country...

1119
01:23:22,485 --> 01:23:24,339
to get him away from those people.

1120
01:23:24,692 --> 01:23:26,960
I thought you were going
to Aunt Margaret's.

1121
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:28,814
We were, but Scott ffolliott...

1122
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:31,084
thought it would be better
to go further away.

1123
01:23:33,935 --> 01:23:37,511
So I thought The College Arms
at Cambridge would be a good place.

1124
01:23:37,964 --> 01:23:40,418
When we got there,
I found out that he wanted...

1125
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,816
You see, we'd been joking about it.

1126
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:48,062
When I heard him book the extra room,
I knew he meant it.

1127
01:23:49,062 --> 01:23:52,027
Cheap trick. That's what hurts.
It was so cheap.

1128
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,749
It wasrt at all like I thought it was.

1129
01:23:56,194 --> 01:23:59,508
What difference does it make,
I don't care if I ever see him again.

1130
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:02,452
You won't have to. We're going
to America tomorrow by clipper.

1131
01:24:02,527 --> 01:24:04,435
Tomorrow? But I can't.

1132
01:24:06,236 --> 01:24:08,690
I suppose I can, but why tomorrow?

1133
01:24:08,763 --> 01:24:11,216
They'll probably declare war tomorrow.

1134
01:24:11,289 --> 01:24:13,709
We have to get to Washington.
The boats will be crowded.

1135
01:24:13,784 --> 01:24:15,638
We may have to wait two weeks
for passage.

1136
01:24:15,703 --> 01:24:19,050
- But what about Mr. Van Meer?
- We've done all we could.

1137
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:23,275
I was at the foreign office.
They're taking the whole thing over.

1138
01:24:24,114 --> 01:24:26,698
- What is it?
- The blackout. I have to draw the blinds.

1139
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:29,866
I forgot. Before you do that,
order me a taxi.

1140
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:31,014
Yes, sir.

1141
01:24:31,918 --> 01:24:34,251
There are some people I must see
before we leave.

1142
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:36,802
I shouldn't be long.
Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.

1143
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:39,841
We'll drive to Southampton,
stay overnight at the Southwestern.

1144
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:41,025
Stiles, my hat.

1145
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,397
Goodbye, darling.
I'll return as soon as possible.

1146
01:24:43,463 --> 01:24:47,105
Meanwhile, you and Stiles load the car
and get something to eat.

1147
01:24:47,173 --> 01:24:49,954
- But what about you?
- I'll get a sandwich later.

1148
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,591
242 Charlotte Street,
at the top of Tottenam Court Road.

1149
01:25:10,424 --> 01:25:13,455
Wait here until Haverstock turns up.
He's bound to come here.

1150
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:16,045
When he does, bring him to
242, Charlotte Street...

1151
01:25:16,117 --> 01:25:17,742
off of Tottenam Court Road.

1152
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,501
Be careful.

1153
01:26:16,626 --> 01:26:18,414
Might I use your telephone?

1154
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:20,358
This way, sir.

1155
01:26:40,037 --> 01:26:41,466
- Where is he?
- In there.

1156
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,873
We can't make him say anything.
It's up to you.

1157
01:26:43,939 --> 01:26:46,359
Let's go. Is this place safe?

1158
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:48,952
There'll be no interruptions.
We close it for decorations.

1159
01:26:49,024 --> 01:26:51,511
- The people downstairs?
- They won't make trouble.

1160
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:54,842
They know what will happen
to their relatives if they do.

1161
01:27:20,814 --> 01:27:23,911
It's an attractive nest, I know,
and the music...

1162
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,597
- It serves its purpose.
- Yes.

1163
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,199
Pardon me.

1164
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:54,584
Put your arm around him.
Hold his head forward.

1165
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:59,600
These lights, can't you cut them down?

1166
01:28:06,644 --> 01:28:07,985
I thank you.

1167
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:11,369
I thank you very much.

1168
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:17,737
You're like my friend Mr. Fisher.

1169
01:28:18,477 --> 01:28:21,639
I'm sorry. It's just so dark...

1170
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:25,954
I can't tell...

1171
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,104
but you are so like my friend.

1172
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:34,147
I am Fisher, Mr. Van Meer.
I am your friend.

1173
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,593
I'm so glad.

1174
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,893
Are the police here?

1175
01:28:41,568 --> 01:28:43,509
They mustrt get away.

1176
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:46,519
You mustrt let these people go.

1177
01:28:49,627 --> 01:28:53,553
I represent Jupiter Life Insurance.
Would you like a small policy?

1178
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:01,906
- Why did you bring him up here?
- I didn't know what to do.

1179
01:29:01,973 --> 01:29:04,306
I'd gladly relieve the lady
of this embarrassment.

1180
01:29:04,371 --> 01:29:07,119
You know how women are with firearms,
no sense of timing.

1181
01:29:07,186 --> 01:29:09,901
I'll just sit here. You carry on with
what you were doing.

1182
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,749
Don't mind me.
I sometimes sit like this for hours.

1183
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:14,444
Who's that?

1184
01:29:14,702 --> 01:29:16,457
Is it the police?

1185
01:29:17,324 --> 01:29:19,908
Tell me where I am.

1186
01:29:20,234 --> 01:29:22,273
You are in London, Mr. Van Meer.

1187
01:29:22,346 --> 01:29:23,654
In London?

1188
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:26,502
Have I been here long?

1189
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:32,319
You must send a telegram to my wife.

1190
01:29:32,388 --> 01:29:34,753
Tell her that I am safe with you.

1191
01:29:34,819 --> 01:29:37,784
Please try to understand, Mr. Van Meer.
The police are not here.

1192
01:29:37,856 --> 01:29:39,960
I am here merely to talk to you.

1193
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,963
But these people...

1194
01:29:43,325 --> 01:29:46,619
They think I'm working with them.
They don't know that I'm your friend.

1195
01:29:46,843 --> 01:29:48,784
We must play a little game.

1196
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,416
A little game?

1197
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:53,683
Yes. They've asked me
to get you to tell me...

1198
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:55,573
what they're trying to find out.

1199
01:29:55,638 --> 01:29:57,841
But I can't do that.

1200
01:29:58,421 --> 01:30:00,110
You know that I can't.

1201
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:02,060
You can tell me.

1202
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:06,315
Just that one clause in the treaty.
Clause 27.

1203
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:11,017
Clause 27. Come, Mr. Van Meer.

1204
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:14,119
That's the secret clause.

1205
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:17,825
I know it, Clause 27.

1206
01:30:18,505 --> 01:30:20,773
But they, they mustrt know it.

1207
01:30:21,032 --> 01:30:23,550
It would help them if they make war.

1208
01:30:23,622 --> 01:30:25,116
War, Fisher.

1209
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:28,192
- You don't want them helped, do you?
- Of course not.

1210
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:32,602
Just let them see you telling it to me.
That'll be enough.

1211
01:30:33,089 --> 01:30:35,641
Let them see you whisper it to me.

1212
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,297
I'll promise to keep it safe.

1213
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:41,495
He's not your friend, Mr. Van Meer.
Don't tell him.

1214
01:30:42,044 --> 01:30:43,385
Who's that?

1215
01:30:44,123 --> 01:30:47,023
Someone just said you werert my friend.

1216
01:30:48,856 --> 01:30:51,156
Why didn't you bring the police?

1217
01:30:51,734 --> 01:30:54,831
Why aren't you taking me away from here?

1218
01:30:57,459 --> 01:30:59,946
You are not to take me away.

1219
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,120
Why?

1220
01:31:10,092 --> 01:31:11,466
Where are you?

1221
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:15,107
Help me.

1222
01:31:18,823 --> 01:31:19,968
That's it.

1223
01:31:21,286 --> 01:31:22,714
I see now.

1224
01:31:23,716 --> 01:31:26,976
There's no help. No help...

1225
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:32,253
for the whole poor suffering world.

1226
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:38,067
You cry peace, Fisher.

1227
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,815
Peace. And there was no peace.

1228
01:31:42,266 --> 01:31:45,777
Only war and death.

1229
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,660
You're a liar, Fisher.

1230
01:31:49,622 --> 01:31:51,824
A cruel liar.

1231
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:56,401
You can do what you want with me.

1232
01:31:56,818 --> 01:31:58,726
That's not important.

1233
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,988
But you'll never conquer them, Fisher.

1234
01:32:04,174 --> 01:32:06,441
Little people everywhere...

1235
01:32:06,892 --> 01:32:09,062
who give crumbs to birds.

1236
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,816
Lie to them.

1237
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:15,782
Drive them, whip them...

1238
01:32:16,647 --> 01:32:19,198
force them into war.

1239
01:32:20,037 --> 01:32:22,653
When the beasts like you...

1240
01:32:22,723 --> 01:32:25,405
will devour each other...

1241
01:32:26,816 --> 01:32:28,757
then the world...

1242
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:33,275
will belong to the little people.

1243
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:35,638
We're wasting valuable time.

1244
01:33:04,076 --> 01:33:07,783
All right. I will tell you...

1245
01:33:09,896 --> 01:33:12,098
I will tell everything.

1246
01:33:12,615 --> 01:33:14,338
Come on, Mr. Fisher.

1247
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:19,808
In the event of invasion by an enemy...

1248
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:25,240
Why, it's only a restaurant.

1249
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:27,191
Look! Come on!

1250
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:30,458
This way. Down the back stairs.

1251
01:33:54,351 --> 01:33:55,463
Follow me.

1252
01:34:10,982 --> 01:34:12,672
They must've gone the other way.

1253
01:34:12,741 --> 01:34:13,950
Look after him.

1254
01:34:23,702 --> 01:34:26,035
You're a blithering idiot
if you don't nab Fisher...

1255
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:27,475
before he boards that plane.

1256
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,611
How can we arrest him
without any evidence?

1257
01:34:29,683 --> 01:34:32,071
You're obstinate.
Isn't Van Meer proof enough?

1258
01:34:32,145 --> 01:34:33,737
No, and you ought to know it.

1259
01:34:33,808 --> 01:34:35,749
What proof is there against
Fisher personally?

1260
01:34:35,823 --> 01:34:37,709
Of all the conceited, stupid numbskull...

1261
01:34:37,774 --> 01:34:40,707
Stop behaving like a boy scout
and let us handle this.

1262
01:34:41,036 --> 01:34:42,530
Ask McKenna to come in.

1263
01:34:42,604 --> 01:34:45,352
Go see Dr. Boniface.
He's very good for nerves.

1264
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:47,718
- Identification of Van Meer complete?
- Yes.

1265
01:34:47,784 --> 01:34:51,131
He's unconscious, but there's no doubt
it's Van Meer.

1266
01:34:51,206 --> 01:34:52,482
You'd better get back.

1267
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:55,647
Take somebody along to get a statement
when he comes to.

1268
01:34:55,972 --> 01:34:58,174
Meanwhile, keep an eye
on that flying boat...

1269
01:34:58,242 --> 01:34:59,768
await instructions from us.

1270
01:34:59,938 --> 01:35:02,173
What's the good of being related
to Scotland Yard?

1271
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,816
- My fool brother won't do anything.
- Scotland Yard can't solve my problems.

1272
01:35:05,886 --> 01:35:08,918
- Everyone's in on it but me.
- You're in it, too.

1273
01:35:08,988 --> 01:35:12,815
We've got to watch that plane.
While we're driving...

1274
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,954
- ring Mayfair 24574.
- Let me write that.

1275
01:35:16,024 --> 01:35:19,339
Mayfair 24574. That's my cousin.
He's the director of the airline.

1276
01:35:19,415 --> 01:35:23,089
Tell him we need two seats
on tomorrow's clipper to America.

1277
01:35:23,157 --> 01:35:25,838
Then go to Hilton Nursing Home
and stick by Van Meer.

1278
01:35:25,907 --> 01:35:28,807
Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster,
Kensington 66255.

1279
01:35:28,881 --> 01:35:30,254
Tell her I'm off to America.

1280
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,028
Will she dine with me next Monday
instead of tomorrow?

1281
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:36,297
<i>- Sure.
- Then call up Stevens at the Post.</i>

1282
01:35:36,365 --> 01:35:38,306
Tell him I'm off to America.

1283
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:40,964
Cable New York,
tell them I'm off to America.

1284
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:44,099
Ring up the Crescent Dancing Academy
and cancel my rumba lesson.

1285
01:35:44,936 --> 01:35:47,356
Two ham sandwiches on rye bread.

1286
01:35:49,414 --> 01:35:53,437
- There's no use in my waiting around.
- It's hard to say how soon he'll recover.

1287
01:35:53,507 --> 01:35:55,361
It may be some hours before he can speak.

1288
01:35:55,426 --> 01:35:58,207
I don't know much about this,
but my friend's on the clipper.

1289
01:35:58,272 --> 01:36:01,402
If Van Meer speaks,
they'll send word to the plane.

1290
01:36:01,471 --> 01:36:03,128
Did you hear the wireless?

1291
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:05,618
War is declared! Read all about it.

1292
01:36:07,323 --> 01:36:10,388
War declared! It's war with Germany!

1293
01:36:39,785 --> 01:36:41,856
I found that picture.

1294
01:36:57,151 --> 01:36:59,899
- Steward, bring me one of those, please.
- Yes, sir.

1295
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,234
- Any message for me?
- What name?

1296
01:37:32,299 --> 01:37:35,047
- Is there a message for me?
- I'll be with you in a minute.

1297
01:37:37,096 --> 01:37:38,917
- This one's for me.
- Yes, sir.

1298
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,748
Lovely, isn't it?

1299
01:37:53,823 --> 01:37:56,603
Sort of makes you forget
all about the war and troubles.

1300
01:37:57,725 --> 01:38:01,978
It would be nice if we could keep flying,
live in the clouds.

1301
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:04,279
Yes, it would be very nice.

1302
01:38:05,721 --> 01:38:09,679
It's time for me to make a landing,
a forced landing.

1303
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:12,687
What's the matter? Anything happen?

1304
01:38:12,948 --> 01:38:15,696
I've got to talk to you.
I don't want to, but I've got to.

1305
01:38:15,763 --> 01:38:17,867
The hardest part is talking to you now.

1306
01:38:17,938 --> 01:38:19,824
I don't mind about the rest.

1307
01:38:20,623 --> 01:38:24,996
- It's about Krug and Van Meer.
- You've guessed.

1308
01:38:25,517 --> 01:38:28,297
Not till last night. I've been worried...

1309
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:30,281
but I believed in you.

1310
01:38:30,346 --> 01:38:31,807
You shouldn't.

1311
01:38:33,192 --> 01:38:36,354
It's true, then, what I wouldn't believe?

1312
01:38:36,647 --> 01:38:39,940
Yes. I'm to be arrested when we land...

1313
01:38:40,868 --> 01:38:43,201
as a spy, shipped back to London.

1314
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:48,187
It's quite all right, except,
just the one phase of it. You.

1315
01:38:49,055 --> 01:38:51,061
That's why I've got to talk to you.

1316
01:38:52,701 --> 01:38:55,995
I should like for you to see a little
from my point of view...

1317
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:00,275
it might help you afterwards.

1318
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:03,055
First about yourself, my deceiving you.

1319
01:39:03,224 --> 01:39:06,189
I didn't want you involved in any part
because you're English...

1320
01:39:06,262 --> 01:39:09,424
half-English anyway. I'm not.
I'm just coated with an English accent.

1321
01:39:09,492 --> 01:39:10,736
A thin coat.

1322
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:14,566
I fought for my country in my heart
in a very difficult way.

1323
01:39:14,961 --> 01:39:19,181
Sometimes it's harder to fight
dishonorably than nobly in the open.

1324
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:23,431
I used my country's methods
because I was born with them.

1325
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:26,400
I don't intend on making this plea
to the court-martial.

1326
01:39:27,146 --> 01:39:30,373
I'm making it only to my daughter
whom I loved dearly...

1327
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:34,940
and before whom I feel a little ashamed.

1328
01:39:40,002 --> 01:39:43,349
What you say to me now
means more to me than any verdict.

1329
01:39:44,033 --> 01:39:45,276
My dear...

1330
01:39:46,015 --> 01:39:49,591
Steward, this is not for me.
It was a mistake.

1331
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,582
I'm not sitting 14 hours
playing hide-and-seek with her.

1332
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,536
I'm going to talk to her.

1333
01:39:56,602 --> 01:39:59,567
It can't do any harm,
now that he knows we're aboard.

1334
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,500
- Not a word in front of her, understand?
- I wouldn't dream of talking.

1335
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:06,643
- What will you say to her?
- I don't know. I'm all mixed up.

1336
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:09,162
I love her, and I'm going to help
hang her father.

1337
01:40:09,235 --> 01:40:11,655
I've got to say something. I'll go crazy.

1338
01:40:12,976 --> 01:40:14,862
Have some brandy. You'll feel better.

1339
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:17,381
You know it always makes me cry harder.

1340
01:40:18,925 --> 01:40:21,225
- Surprised?
- What are you doing here?

1341
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:23,330
Having myself a ride.

1342
01:40:23,914 --> 01:40:27,043
Carol, I've got to speak to you alone.
It's very important.

1343
01:40:27,112 --> 01:40:29,860
- Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?
- Ffolliott's with you, isn't he?

1344
01:40:29,927 --> 01:40:31,420
In a way, yes.

1345
01:40:31,846 --> 01:40:33,371
You're both after my father.

1346
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,963
You're having him arrested
when we land, aren't you?

1347
01:40:36,035 --> 01:40:38,816
I don't know what you mean.
I never arrested anyone in my life.

1348
01:40:38,881 --> 01:40:42,043
That's a lie. You've followed him
from the beginning.

1349
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:45,078
That's why you wanted me
out of the way at the inn...

1350
01:40:45,405 --> 01:40:49,429
pretended you loved me so you could...
It's a lie, that's all.

1351
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:51,887
Everything you've said to me
have been lies.

1352
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,349
- Quite a reunion, isn't it?
- You, too?

1353
01:40:54,425 --> 01:40:57,522
Please. Have a drink, Scott. I'll be back.

1354
01:40:57,591 --> 01:40:59,859
- Where are you going?
- To stretch my legs.

1355
01:40:59,926 --> 01:41:02,990
I read that wire you received.
It was given to me by mistake.

1356
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,488
That's all right, sir.

1357
01:41:04,563 --> 01:41:06,951
You're not going unless I go with you.

1358
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:10,057
I know you both think
my father is a traitor and a renegade.

1359
01:41:10,128 --> 01:41:11,949
He isn't. Not to me.

1360
01:41:12,047 --> 01:41:14,631
Thank you.
A minority report, but very welcome.

1361
01:41:14,893 --> 01:41:19,113
Carol, I've got nothing to do with spies.
I'm just a reporter here after a story.

1362
01:41:19,178 --> 01:41:20,933
I'm sorry I ever heard of Van Meer.

1363
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:24,382
<i>I'd blow up the Globe, cut Powers' throat
rather than harm you.</i>

1364
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:29,406
What is it?

1365
01:41:32,323 --> 01:41:34,362
They've gone crazy. What are they doing?

1366
01:41:34,434 --> 01:41:35,927
Who are they? What is it?

1367
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:39,255
Call Bob. Tell him we're being attacked.

1368
01:41:44,157 --> 01:41:47,057
Sorry about this, ffolliott.
It has nothing to do with me.

1369
01:41:48,154 --> 01:41:49,081
We're coming down.

1370
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:51,086
You're the most cool-headed woman
I've ever seen.

1371
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,272
Make Father wear this.

1372
01:41:52,344 --> 01:41:54,034
Here you are. Put these on.

1373
01:41:57,045 --> 01:41:59,695
Come out, sir.
They're all going nuts in there.

1374
01:41:59,764 --> 01:42:01,356
I'll be out immediately.

1375
01:42:01,427 --> 01:42:04,043
What am I going to say?
This isn't like bad weather.

1376
01:42:04,113 --> 01:42:06,501
Tell them it's a mistake,
that it's target practice.

1377
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:10,339
I know it's funny for me to ask you
to be calm.

1378
01:42:10,414 --> 01:42:12,201
We're doing the best we can.

1379
01:42:13,644 --> 01:42:14,690
Get back.

1380
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,762
Are we all going to drown?

1381
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:26,207
Keep away from that window, sir.
It might be dangerous. Sit back.

1382
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,699
I'm not going to put this on.

1383
01:42:29,091 --> 01:42:31,740
I've never heard of anything so stupid.

1384
01:42:31,809 --> 01:42:34,044
I'll see the British Consul as soon as l...

1385
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:48,725
She's gone.

1386
01:42:54,613 --> 01:42:56,467
What in the name of heaven
are they doing?

1387
01:43:03,823 --> 01:43:06,123
Switch off the gas.
You've got the other board motor.

1388
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:08,938
- They cut off the other starboard motor.
- Right.

1389
01:43:09,228 --> 01:43:12,194
It's the Germans. They're sorry.
They thought we were a bomber.

1390
01:43:12,266 --> 01:43:13,989
She'll rescue us straight-away.

1391
01:43:14,058 --> 01:43:15,551
The wings are off.

1392
01:43:19,143 --> 01:43:21,508
- Let me get out!
- Come away from that door.

1393
01:43:21,893 --> 01:43:23,746
We can't just stay here.

1394
01:43:23,812 --> 01:43:25,949
When she hits the water,
the tail's the best place.

1395
01:43:26,019 --> 01:43:27,098
Come on.

1396
01:45:54,254 --> 01:45:58,082
No good staying on here,
she's going under. Quick, onto the wing.

1397
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:52,259
Look, there's the pilot.

1398
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:20,660
- Don't let him on, you fools!
- Shut your mouth!

1399
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,391
I'm throwing that swine off.

1400
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:25,142
He's right. It won't hold us.
I'd better slip away.

1401
01:47:25,211 --> 01:47:28,079
I'll move to the other end.
That might make it lighter here.

1402
01:47:47,758 --> 01:47:49,251
He's gone!

1403
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,369
Johnny, don't go! You'll be washed away!

1404
01:48:08,803 --> 01:48:10,427
Johnny, come back!

1405
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,206
Look!

1406
01:48:45,805 --> 01:48:48,106
Must be the enemy coming to pick us up.

1407
01:48:49,227 --> 01:48:50,536
Is it the enemy?

1408
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:53,056
We're all right. She's American.

1409
01:48:55,867 --> 01:48:58,615
American ship picked us up
and is taking us back to London.

1410
01:48:58,682 --> 01:49:01,014
I can't tell you what happened.

1411
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,955
I'll wire from London in a few days. Bye.

1412
01:49:04,726 --> 01:49:07,277
It's awkward, I just spoke to the captain.

1413
01:49:07,348 --> 01:49:09,452
He insists on acting the true blue neutral.

1414
01:49:09,523 --> 01:49:12,369
"Enemy waters," he says. Not a line
to the press from his ship.

1415
01:49:12,433 --> 01:49:13,926
Can't send out any stories?

1416
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,039
We can use the phone
for private messages.

1417
01:49:16,112 --> 01:49:18,598
<i>"Hello, Aunt Effie,
safe aboard the Mohican.</i>

1418
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:20,196
"Feeling tiptop."

1419
01:49:20,749 --> 01:49:24,260
Two days before we get to London,
we get scooped on our own story.

1420
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:27,428
- You have a crack at brass buttons.
- Even if he says okay...

1421
01:49:27,497 --> 01:49:29,536
what good will it do me?
My hands are tied.

1422
01:49:29,607 --> 01:49:31,133
- What are you talking about?
- Carol.

1423
01:49:31,207 --> 01:49:34,239
I came 4,000 miles to get a story.
I get shot at...

1424
01:49:34,309 --> 01:49:37,984
I got pushed off buildings.
I get the story, then I got to shut up.

1425
01:49:38,787 --> 01:49:41,785
I'm sincere. I'm not throwing her father
up for grabs.

1426
01:49:41,857 --> 01:49:45,019
He died like a hero to save her
and the rest of us.

1427
01:49:45,503 --> 01:49:47,226
I'm talking through my hat.

1428
01:49:47,294 --> 01:49:49,496
The whole point is, he was her father.

1429
01:49:49,564 --> 01:49:51,603
I won't play Judas to the only girl...

1430
01:49:51,675 --> 01:49:54,008
I'm very glad you said that.

1431
01:49:54,074 --> 01:49:56,113
- You all dry and everything?
- I'm all right.

1432
01:49:56,185 --> 01:49:58,006
Send the whole story.

1433
01:49:58,072 --> 01:50:00,045
- We'll talk about that later.
- Please.

1434
01:50:00,118 --> 01:50:03,499
You can't help me by protecting my father.

1435
01:50:03,573 --> 01:50:05,360
I'm in love with you.

1436
01:50:05,427 --> 01:50:07,946
I can't hit you with a scandal
for a wedding present.

1437
01:50:09,138 --> 01:50:11,340
My father fought for his country his way.

1438
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:14,222
It wasrt a straight way,
but it was a hard way.

1439
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:17,483
And I've got to fight for my country
a hard way.

1440
01:50:17,805 --> 01:50:20,138
Okay, if that's the way you feel.

1441
01:50:21,994 --> 01:50:23,204
That's for me.

1442
01:50:23,274 --> 01:50:26,119
I put in a call to my uncle, Uncle Powers.

1443
01:50:26,504 --> 01:50:27,485
Hello?

1444
01:50:28,263 --> 01:50:30,945
<i>Johnny Jones is calling from the Mohican.</i>

1445
01:50:31,013 --> 01:50:34,655
What's he doing there?
Johnny wouldn't call if it wasrt a story.

1446
01:50:34,723 --> 01:50:38,747
Hold the presses. Send Bradley in here.
Tell him we're breaking up Page 1.

1447
01:50:38,817 --> 01:50:41,597
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Powers. This is Johnny Jones.

1448
01:50:41,662 --> 01:50:43,484
Here comes the captain.

1449
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:49,234
Mr. Powers, keep your ear glued
to this phone and don't hang up.

1450
01:50:55,095 --> 01:50:57,995
- Mr. Haverstock, I want to talk with you.
- Yes, sir.

1451
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:00,785
- I just found out you're a newspaperman.
- That's right.

1452
01:51:01,779 --> 01:51:03,883
Why didn't you tell me
when I questioned you?

1453
01:51:03,954 --> 01:51:06,255
- You lied to me.
- My dear Captain...

1454
01:51:06,321 --> 01:51:09,254
when you're shot down
in a British plane by a German destroyer...

1455
01:51:09,328 --> 01:51:12,425
300 miles off the coast of England,
Latitude 45...

1456
01:51:12,494 --> 01:51:15,045
have been hanging
on a half-submerged wing for hours...

1457
01:51:15,116 --> 01:51:17,929
waiting to drown
with other stricken human beings...

1458
01:51:17,994 --> 01:51:20,808
you're liable to forget
you're a newspaperman.

1459
01:51:20,873 --> 01:51:24,733
You'll have to forget it
for as long as you're on this ship.

1460
01:51:24,806 --> 01:51:26,780
I can't understand your attitude, sir.

1461
01:51:26,854 --> 01:51:29,569
You performed a heroic rescue,
Captain John Martin.

1462
01:51:29,635 --> 01:51:33,789
- You took us out of the sea.
- You're not sending a thing from this ship.

1463
01:51:33,857 --> 01:51:35,133
You're right, Captain.

1464
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,566
We mustrt embarrass
the United States government.

1465
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:39,256
Exactly. That's my point.

1466
01:51:40,925 --> 01:51:44,982
That's the story I've got. I won't print it.
I think you ought to hear it first.

1467
01:51:45,051 --> 01:51:46,708
That's only fair, Captain.

1468
01:51:50,296 --> 01:51:52,661
You know who headed that movement
in London?

1469
01:51:52,726 --> 01:51:53,903
Mr. Stephen Fisher.

1470
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:56,306
The man who ran
the Universal Peace Party?

1471
01:51:56,373 --> 01:51:57,965
- Why, that's preposterous.
- Yes.

1472
01:51:58,036 --> 01:52:00,401
The Mr. Fisher who was drowned
a few hours ago.

1473
01:52:00,466 --> 01:52:03,399
His peace party was a cover-up
for spies and traitors.

1474
01:52:03,472 --> 01:52:06,188
He was going to be arrested and deported.

1475
01:52:06,255 --> 01:52:09,962
- Those are facts.
- I can't believe it. He was a friend of mine.

1476
01:52:10,029 --> 01:52:13,289
He engineered the kidnapping
of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.

1477
01:52:13,355 --> 01:52:15,939
- Nobody would believe that.
- It's the truth.

1478
01:52:16,009 --> 01:52:18,147
- I refuse...
- Dear Captain, wait a minute.

1479
01:52:18,216 --> 01:52:21,596
This young lady should know
whether it's the truth or not.

1480
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:24,603
Yes, I ought to know.
Mr. Fisher was my father.

1481
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:27,129
And I want the story printed.

1482
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:30,875
- What's that?
- I guess that's my uncle.

1483
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,318
Hello, Uncle. How are you?

1484
01:52:37,246 --> 01:52:40,343
How's Aunt Sadie? I'm all right, thanks.

1485
01:52:40,412 --> 01:52:43,345
We had a little accident.
I can't tell you about it now.

1486
01:52:43,418 --> 01:52:45,304
I'll write to you.

1487
01:52:45,465 --> 01:52:47,155
I'm going back to Europe.

1488
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,999
I was just wondering
if you had any instructions for me.

1489
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:53,135
Yes. Keep on the job.
Have you got all that down?

1490
01:52:53,205 --> 01:52:54,633
Rush it out at once.

1491
01:53:06,925 --> 01:53:08,200
This is London.

1492
01:53:08,268 --> 01:53:11,135
We have as a guest tonight
a soldier of the press...

1493
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:13,031
one of the army of historians...

1494
01:53:13,097 --> 01:53:15,714
writing history from beside
the cannors mouth...

1495
01:53:16,007 --> 01:53:18,395
<i>Foreign correspondent
of the New York Globe...</i>

1496
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:19,647
Huntley Haverstock.

1497
01:53:19,718 --> 01:53:20,994
Hello, America.

1498
01:53:21,061 --> 01:53:23,743
I've been watching a part of the world
being blown to pieces.

1499
01:53:23,811 --> 01:53:26,427
A part of the world
as nice as Vermont, Ohio...

1500
01:53:26,497 --> 01:53:28,601
Virginia, and California, and Illinois...

1501
01:53:28,672 --> 01:53:31,540
lies ripped up and bleeding
like a steer in a slaughterhouse.

1502
01:53:31,615 --> 01:53:35,638
I've seen things that make the history of
savages read like Pollyanna legends.

1503
01:53:36,188 --> 01:53:39,415
- We'll have to postpone the broadcast.
- Let's go on as long as we can.

1504
01:53:39,482 --> 01:53:41,488
Madam, we have a shelter downstairs.

1505
01:53:42,137 --> 01:53:45,267
- How about it, Carol?
- They're listening in America, Johnny.

1506
01:53:45,335 --> 01:53:47,438
Okay. We'll tell them, then.

1507
01:53:48,597 --> 01:53:51,378
I can't read the rest of my speech
because the lights went out...

1508
01:53:51,443 --> 01:53:53,329
so I'll have to talk off the cuff.

1509
01:53:53,714 --> 01:53:56,908
That noise you hear isn't static.
It's death coming to London.

1510
01:53:56,976 --> 01:54:00,357
You can hear the bombs
falling on the streets and the homes.

1511
01:54:00,430 --> 01:54:04,105
Don't tune me out. Hang on.
This is a big story. You're part of it.

1512
01:54:04,172 --> 01:54:07,683
It's too late to do anything here
except stand in the dark, let them come.

1513
01:54:07,754 --> 01:54:11,232
It's as if the lights were out everywhere
except in America.

1514
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:13,345
Keep those lights burning.

1515
01:54:13,415 --> 01:54:15,868
Cover them with steel,
ring them with guns...

1516
01:54:15,941 --> 01:54:18,809
build a canopy of battleships
and bombing planes around them.

1517
01:54:18,884 --> 01:54:21,184
Hello, America, hang onto your lights.

1518
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,486
They're the only lights left in the world.
