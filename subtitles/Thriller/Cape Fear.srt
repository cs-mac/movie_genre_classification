1
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,597
My reminiscence.

2
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:39,599
I always thought
that for such a lovely river...

3
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:41,518
...the name was mystifying:

4
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,279
Cape Fear.

5
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:47,155
When the only thing to fear
on those enchanted summer nights...

6
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:51,843
...was that the magic would end
and real life would come crashing in.

7
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,246
Okay, Cady, the moment
you've been waiting for.

8
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,366
Any people coming for you, Cady?

9
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,757
-What about your books?
-Already read them.

10
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,399
Hi. How are you?

11
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:28,484
-? Cómo estás?
-Bien.

12
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,881
This ropa limpia?

13
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,562
No, that means "clean." These are dirty.

14
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:38,043
The idea is to resolve the tension.

15
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:42,479
I need to find a motif
that's about movement.

16
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,883
Not the most mind-blowing concept
for a travel agency...

17
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,844
...but what the hey?

18
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,205
-Like an arrow, maybe?
-Yeah, like an arrow.

19
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:53,640
Maybe.

20
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:57,322
But, see, then the other aspect
is stability...

21
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:00,205
...a company that you can trust.

22
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,437
So if you can balance those ideas...

23
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,804
...in a way that's pleasing to the eye
then you got a logo.

24
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,879
Okay: Movement, stability...

25
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,798
...and an arrow.

26
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:15,997
Okay, I'll think of something for that one.

27
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,358
Benjamin! Yes.

28
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,325
They switched babies on me
at the hospital, didn't they?

29
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,920
How'd you do in there?

30
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,636
I got the judge to postpone
the alimony hearing for another 21 days.

31
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,319
Great.

32
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,843
I've got till Monday to find out
which S and L and which municipality...

33
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:35,760
-...my son-in-law stashed all that money.
-Right.

34
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,725
-Anyway, my daughter and I thank you.
-You're welcome, Tom.

35
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,799
Here's Daddyl

36
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,442
Good-bye, Juniorl

37
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,006
!Adios!

38
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:59,119
Yes, that's very creative, Junior.

39
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,443
He liked me.

40
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,805
All this time, he actually liked me.

41
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:21,599
You can't go in. Your father's making
a television appearance for his campaign.

42
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,638
Dad, I've got to talk to you.

43
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:28,322
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm about to go on the air.

44
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:31,205
What is this smoke?

45
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,522
Excuse me.

46
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,556
Come on, let's move seats.

47
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,317
Okay, then I quit as your son.

48
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,041
Do you believe that annoying loser guy?

49
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,038
You should have just punched him out.

50
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,687
What? Just punched him out?
What do you mean?

51
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:08,123
You boxed. You could've
shoved him around, shut him up.

52
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,686
-I could take you.
-Careful.

53
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,725
-That's who I could take.
-You could've kicked him in the face.

54
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,160
Kicked him in the face?

55
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:17,239
You know how to fight dirty.
You do that for a living.

56
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,838
Real cute, Leigh.

57
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:22,077
-Let's sit outside.
-How much do I owe you?

58
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,601
-It's taken care of.
-Taken care of? Who?

59
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:26,246
There.

60
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:42,886
Girls, come on, let's sit inside.
Yeah, let's sit inside.

61
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,399
Mr. Perfect Form.

62
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,206
-Look.
-What?

63
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,757
You gotta snap your wrist
on the backhand.

64
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,315
Usually I like a little music
at this point, Sam.

65
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,602
Sam, I want to play in this lifetime.

66
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,917
All right.

67
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,157
-You gotta snap your wrist.
-Tag.

68
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:31,206
-We should stop doing this for a while.
-Doing what? We're not doing anything.

69
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:32,959
-No, I know that.
-Yet.

70
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:36,005
Okay. Fine. Maybe you're right.

71
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,486
Why? Does your wife mind?

72
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,765
My wife doesn't even know you exist,
which, most certainly, is for the best.

73
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,519
Why's that?

74
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,316
God, Lori, you know why you ask
that question?

75
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,443
-'Cause you've never been married.
-Why?

76
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,166
Is marriage synonymous with deception?

77
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,717
It's just that when two people...

78
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:58,243
...get married and live together
for a long time....

79
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,804
I like hanging out with you, so sue me.

80
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,675
You're funny, and you're cute,
and, I don't know....

81
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,476
We talk about the courts
and which judge is senile...

82
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,558
...which one wears a gun under his robe.

83
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:17,083
Oh, God. You know, Lori,
another time, another place...

84
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,566
...and who knows?

85
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,515
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah, it's a light docket.

86
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,838
No, I won two out of three.
Let's make it best out of five.

87
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:30,882
All right, that's good, actually,
because today I let you win.

88
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,557
-Sure you did.
-See ya.

89
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,605
Free as a bird. You go wherever you want
with whomever.

90
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,360
That much freedom
could get a fellow in trouble.

91
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,837
-I'd like my keys.
-Could it be you don't remember me?

92
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,600
I remember you.
You were at the movies the other night.

93
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,643
I'm disappointed. I'm hurt.

94
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,558
I would like my keys.

95
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,885
Max Cady.

96
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,400
You look the same.

97
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,364
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.

98
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:08,076
But they say the average man
gains a pound a year till he's about...

99
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,445
Come on.

100
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,637
Gains a pound a year till he's about 60.

101
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:17,117
Me? I dropped a pound every year
in my sentence.

102
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,441
-Atlanta, '77.
-You got it. July.

103
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:25,159
Fourteen years since I held a set of keys.

104
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,797
Well, you look good, healthy.

105
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:33,038
Thank you. It's a struggle
to stay healthy in the joint.

106
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:35,762
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

107
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:39,283
They would stick you with
the white trash. They don't work all day.

108
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,520
In fact...

109
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,837
...this little old cigar is my only vice...

110
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,476
...'cause I needed a vice in the joint
to remind me I was human.

111
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,996
What brings you to New Essex?

112
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:52,918
Oh, the climate.

113
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,520
Boy, the South.

114
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:59,077
I'm thinking of settling down here
in New Essex, Counselor.

115
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,560
Have you been following me?

116
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,161
It's a small town.
We're gonna run into each other.

117
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,080
-Well, take care, Mr. Cady.
-You, too.

118
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,160
-You're gonna learn about loss.
-What?

119
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,763
Dad, could you....

120
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry, Dani.

121
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:31,077
-What're you working on?
-It's English.

122
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,442
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel...

123
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,677
...which is a kind of reminiscence...

124
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,759
...and we have to attempt something
in the same style.

125
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,043
What's it about, your reminiscence?

126
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,078
The houseboat.

127
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,558
It's not even July 3 yet.

128
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,115
We ought to take two weeks
and go to Wilmington...

129
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,357
...like the old times, dock the houseboat.

130
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:03,200
I wanted to in early June.
You said you didn't have time.

131
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,801
-I probably don't.
-Yeah, now I don't, either.

132
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,242
Besides, Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

133
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,036
Is it really that critical
that she can't miss two damn weeks?

134
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,561
You know,
the alternative was to expel her.

135
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:19,125
Maybe this Drama teacher from the college
will get her excited about something.

136
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,516
Yeah, about him, probably.

137
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,316
Why'd they have to make such a stink,
like she was on heroin, or something?

138
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,602
I mean, what's marijuana?

139
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:30,326
You and I smoked a little dope in our time.

140
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:33,599
In some cultures,
it's considered almost a sacrament.

141
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,598
I realize in ours it's forbidden.

142
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:40,477
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality.

143
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,046
Honey.

144
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:45,358
-Worship of idols, cannibalism.
-Do that again.

145
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,600
-What?
-Do that again.

146
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,087
-Sam, somebody's out there!
-What?

147
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,276
Leave the light off. Leave it off.

148
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,279
I saw him when the fireworks went off.

149
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,039
What?

150
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,164
-I think I talked to him this afternoon.
-You know him?

151
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:54,915
I want you the hell off my property!

152
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,959
He's gone.

153
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,642
He said,
"I'm gonna make you think about loss."

154
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:21,197
Or, "I'm gonna make you learn about loss."
Something like that.

155
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,721
That's very poetic.

156
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,719
-Who is he? Where did he come from?
-He's from....

157
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,958
Come on, Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

158
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:34,721
He doesn't mind me at all.
It's your dog. Come on.

159
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,843
No, he shouldn't be up on the table.

160
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,646
-You'll have dog hairs in the tea.
-Get down.

161
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,160
Where's he from?

162
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,636
He's from the hills, Pentecostal crackers.

163
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:46,718
What was he in prison for?

164
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,524
-I think it was battery.
-You think it was battery?

165
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:55,998
-Who did he batter? A man? A woman?
-I don't know.

166
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,716
It was fourteen years ago.
You know, it's kind of....

167
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,002
I really don't remember.

168
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,447
What does he want with you?

169
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,166
He's just trying to bug us,
just messing around.

170
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:10,966
He's an ex-con, so he's just....

171
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:15,439
You know, he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

172
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,485
-Yeah, your clientele.
-Yeah.

173
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,240
-'Bye, Dad.
-'Bye, Dani.

174
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,046
-You look tired.
-Thanks. I needed that.

175
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,924
I'd rather Dani didn't wander out alone...

176
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,599
...on her walks in the woods...

177
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,679
...till I've started a few things,
maybe even talk to the boss.

178
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,804
-What if she takes Benjamin with her?
-Big Ben, our guard dog?

179
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,764
What's he gonna do, lick him to death?

180
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,964
-Just tell her.
-What? I hardly know anything about him.

181
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,925
I don't mean his biography.
Just there's some creep around.

182
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,567
If you see him again,
call the cops and then call me.

183
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,683
What about a weapon?

184
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:54,123
In case things get exciting around here.

185
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:57,005
Would you feel more secure
with a loaded gun in the house?

186
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,282
We'd end up using it on each other.

187
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:03,042
Or Dani would. He won't do anything.
He just got out of prison.

188
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,436
He doesn't want to go right back.

189
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,479
Call Lee Heller.

190
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:13,481
Lee is a colorful character but he's still
the best criminal lawyer in the state.

191
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,876
-Good.
-Get me Lee Heller.

192
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,198
-Sam, you defended this guy, right?
-Right.

193
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,323
What makes you think
he wants to harm you?

194
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,204
Yesterday I was getting in my car.

195
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,960
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.

196
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,198
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."

197
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist threat statutes.

198
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,166
Tom, for Christ's sake, the guy's an ex-con.

199
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:39,080
You know as well as I do what that means.

200
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,761
Last night, there he was, behind our house.

201
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,920
-Attempted B and E.
-No, not exactly.

202
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:48,522
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

203
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,117
That's not even trespassing, Sam.

204
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:54,324
Come on. What can I say?
Get a restraining order.

205
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,319
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.

206
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,838
Good. Anything I can do.

207
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,395
Tom, fourteen years ago...

208
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,763
...in this case I had a report on the victim.

209
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,684
-It was a rape case.
-That's right.

210
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,883
Rape and aggravated sexual battery.

211
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,356
Anyway, I had a report on this victim...

212
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:17,166
...and it came back
that she was promiscuous.

213
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,040
And...

214
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:22,644
...l buried it.

215
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,876
-Anybody else know about this?
-No, I buried it.

216
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,164
I didn't show it to the client
or the prosecution.

217
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:35,000
But if you had seen
what this guy had done to this girl...

218
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:37,885
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...

219
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,322
"...the Assistance of Counsel
for his defense."

220
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,921
I know the Sixth Amendment.
I believe in it.

221
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,237
That's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

222
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,716
There was no way to serve the law
in that capacity.

223
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,162
Some folks don't have the right
to the best defense?

224
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,238
Of course they deserve the best defense!

225
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,887
But if you had seen what he did
to this girl....

226
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,800
-Buried the report.
-If it was your own daughter.

227
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,799
-Yeah, I mean...
-Buried the report.

228
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,839
Jesus, Sam.

229
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,678
Oh, God.

230
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:13,606
But I don't see how he could know that.
He was illiterate.

231
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,839
I had to read everything to him:
The probable cause affidavit...

232
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,997
...the arrest reports, everything.

233
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:22,956
There's no way he could know that.

234
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,046
Hey, Dani...

235
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:37,766
...it's so quiet out here,
and the light's so perfect...

236
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:40,725
...why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

237
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,320
Why?

238
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,724
I told you why.

239
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:48,880
Is it because he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

240
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,276
What do you know about that? A flasher?

241
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,245
You don't think I've been flashed before?

242
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:58,004
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.

243
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:01,045
If you want to come out, come on out.
If you don't, go on.

244
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,958
Do whatever you want.

245
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,843
But don't go outside.

246
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:13,323
'Afternoon, Counselor.

247
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,558
What do you want, Mr. Cady?

248
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,842
They're great at that age, ain't they?

249
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:32,642
All those discoveries ahead of them.
You're lucky.

250
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:36,080
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

251
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:39,085
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead...

252
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,362
...which, in a way, I was.

253
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:45,526
Mr. Cady, I realize that you suffered.

254
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:49,600
I understand your problem,
but, I mean, why me?

255
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,925
I was your lawyer. I defended you.

256
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,841
Why not badger the D.A. or the judge?

257
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:58,725
-"Badger."
-Why not them?

258
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,965
Best I remember,
they was just doing right by their jobs.

259
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,959
I didn't do my job? Ls that right?

260
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,966
I pleaded you out
to a lesser occluded offense.

261
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,242
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

262
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:16,876
I'd have been up for parole in seven years
according to Georgia penal code.

263
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,243
Rape is a capital offense.
You could've gotten life, death.

264
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,841
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

265
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,527
I learned to read during my stretch.

266
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:31,363
First, Spot Goes To The Farm...

267
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:34,923
...then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

268
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:40,520
Did you know, after I discharged you,
I acted as my own attorney?

269
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,883
Applied several times for an appeal.

270
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,798
No, I didn't know that.

271
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,517
So, here we are...

272
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:53,441
...two lawyers, for all practical purposes,
talking shop.

273
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,518
How much do you want, Mr. Cady?

274
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:00,124
-How much do I want what?
-How much money do you want?

275
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:04,322
Money?
Counselor, do I look destitute to you?

276
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

277
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:11,526
You ever been a woman?

278
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:14,075
-A what?
-A woman.

279
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,996
Some fat, hairy, ugly hillbilly's wet dream?

280
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:26,123
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.

281
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,846
You don't know
what suffering is, Counselor.

282
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,683
Like it says in Galatians 3:

283
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,203
"Have ye suffered so many things in vain?"

284
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:42,120
I learned from the get-go in the joint
to get in touch with my feminine side.

285
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:51,957
I'm open to some sort of discussion
on compensation.

286
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,161
What shall be my compensation, sir...

287
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:58,364
...for being held down and sodomized
by four white guys...

288
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:00,563
...or four black guys?

289
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,683
Shall my compensation be the same?

290
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:06,998
What is the formula for compensation, sir?

291
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:09,282
How about $10,000 in cash?

292
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,406
Do l....

293
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,198
Let's just break that down.

294
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,676
That figure just came
to the top of my head.

295
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:27,397
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.

296
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:29,956
I'll tell you what. Let's say $50,000.

297
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,556
$50,000 into fourteen years.

298
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:35,366
Fourteen years times 365 days...

299
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,280
...is about 5,000 days.

300
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:42,963
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

301
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,798
That's not even minimum wage.

302
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:49,516
To say nothing about the family
and respect that I lost.

303
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:53,481
I don't think you really understand
what we're talking about.

304
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,883
Fourteen years.

305
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,159
Whoops. Uh Ohh...

306
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:02,364
Gotta git.
I'm late for another appointment.

307
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,006
I got some good news.

308
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:10,918
I got the bank, the account number.

309
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,158
I'll call your son-in-law's lawyer,
tell him we're going to court.

310
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:16,238
Mr. Bowden, your wife's on line one.

311
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,397
Ask her to hold. I have to make a call.

312
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,399
-I wouldn't make that call. The way I'd...
-Mr. Bowden...

313
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:23,443
...she says it's urgent.

314
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,362
Yeah?

315
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,517
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

316
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,041
They sounded like he was screaming...

317
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,880
...and then Dani came running in, and l...

318
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,998
...l called the vet.

319
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:45,996
Then it was so weird because...

320
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,601
...it was like he was winding down...

321
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,756
...just winding down like an old clock.

322
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:58,680
Then, all of a sudden, he just stopped.

323
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,398
He had this kind of...

324
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,920
...his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...

325
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,884
...surprised look.

326
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:13,840
And then...

327
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,638
...then he died.

328
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:23,604
He just died, before the vet even got here.

329
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,803
What did the vet say?

330
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,521
-That he was poisoned.
-Poisoned?

331
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,604
What kind of poison?

332
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:37,480
-I don't know what kind of poison.
-Jesus! I told you not to let him out.

333
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,797
-I didn't let him out!
-Then how?

334
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:41,286
Stop!

335
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,762
I've got an English setter myself,
so I don't cotton to dog killers.

336
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:50,557
Trouble is, poisoning a dog is just a fine.

337
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:53,196
But if he's unemployed,
he has to have money...

338
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,005
...or we'll bust him for vagrancy.

339
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,726
We'll give him a full-body strip search.

340
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,475
Jerk a knot in his tail.

341
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,166
All right.

342
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:08,006
They got so many ways on the books
to lean on an undesirable.

343
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:11,238
He'll feel about as welcome
around here as a case of yellow fever.

344
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,239
-Hands against the wall.
-Spread them.

345
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,042
-That him?
-Face the wall.

346
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:19,766
One-way mirror, Mr. Bowden.
He doesn't know you're here.

347
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,997
Yeah, that's him.

348
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:23,918
Get the shirt off.

349
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,885
-Come on, hurry up.
-Just pass it over to him.

350
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:33,245
-Hand it to me.
-Knock off the shoes.

351
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,438
Hand them to the other officer.

352
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,477
Pass them to him. Come on.

353
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,762
Put the arms out.

354
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,117
Put your arms out straight.

355
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:49,840
Roll your palms.

356
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,042
Do what he says.

357
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,844
Turn around, slow.

358
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:07,046
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.

359
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,485
Stand still.

360
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,280
One more step for you.
You know the routine.

361
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,078
Against the wall.

362
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:24,643
We searched his apartment.
Car registration and everything's in order.

363
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:28,117
There's no guns or any other weapons.
But we found these.

364
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,205
Cady's savings account.

365
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:34,645
$30,000?

366
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,083
Yeah, his mother died
while he was serving.

367
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:39,317
The farm got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

368
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,285
He's got money.
Where does that leave us?

369
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,245
At the very least, we nail him
for the dog. What happened?

370
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,046
You let the dog out. Cady abducted him.

371
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,277
We didn't let the dog out.

372
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,363
Cady came into your house?
That's illegal entry with intent.

373
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:58,405
But he didn't come in the house.

374
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:02,804
I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly how he did it.

375
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:05,447
I just know that he did it somehow.

376
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,358
That's not good enough, Mr. Bowden.

377
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,563
You're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

378
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,524
Get off the pants.

379
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,323
Sooner or later, he's gonna screw up.

380
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,365
The sheriff assured me
that they always do. He's an ex-con.

381
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,836
He's going to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

382
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,485
I'd still like to kill him.

383
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,245
How come you didn't join up with them?
You can tap.

384
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,124
You can tap dance.

385
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:57,120
I wanted to once, but I don't know....

386
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:09,117
-Son of a bitch.
-What?

387
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,805
-He's staring at you.
-What are you talking about?

388
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,079
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,681
Hot as a firecracker on the 4th of July.

390
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:30,603
-You're damn lucky to have her, boy.
-You son of a bitch.

391
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,525
Where did he go?

392
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,396
Watch my arm. It might be broke.

393
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:45,083
What's with you? You have no right
to be pushing me around like that.

394
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,477
I was just watching the parade.
I wasn't pranking on nobody.

395
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,082
What are you getting so upset about?

396
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,277
You're lucky I don't sue you.

397
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:55,875
All right.

398
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,765
-Settle down.
-I am settled down.

399
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,399
-What are you doing?
-It's nothing.

400
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:05,763
-Who was that?
-It's no one. Come on.

401
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:09,046
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

402
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:12,556
-I think he really hurt his arm.
-Mom!

403
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:18,606
-Strong drink you got there, mister.
-You said it.

404
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:22,157
Just put a little goldfish in it,
and you'll be fine.

405
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,639
You seem to be having a good time.

406
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,924
-I've been practicing.
-Practicing for what?

407
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:32,041
-How to fall on the floor?
-A life of debauchery.

408
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:33,355
Debauch, what?

409
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:36,041
Debauchery. It's a three-syllable word.

410
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:40,485
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

411
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,237
-I made you blush.
-Blush?

412
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:47,240
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

413
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:52,124
I had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married.

414
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:55,524
-You certainly did not.
-I don't know what I was thinking.

415
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,643
God only knows.

416
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,036
Aren't I the bozo on this bus?

417
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:04,517
Oh, God. Lest you think that I slept
with this particular married guy...

418
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,245
That's your business. Not mine.

419
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:09,797
I don't want to make it sound like
I've been through a busload of them.

420
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,003
That's the way it sounded to me.

421
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,282
-He was the first.
-Oh, yeah.

422
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:16,961
-He was, I swear.
-Oh, yeah.

423
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,561
-Oh, boy.
-Tell it to the judge.

424
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:25,081
-Actually the rat stood me up today.
-Did he?

425
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,646
-Yes!
-What a shame.

426
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:28,479
I know.

427
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,962
So, now it's my turn. Where are you from?

428
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:32,321
Where am I from?

429
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,999
-You're gonna love this.
-Yes.

430
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:38,285
I'm from the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

431
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:47,843
You think I'm joking? That's the truth.
I just got released from prison.

432
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:51,840
My god. This is the way
my day has been turning out.

433
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,485
Actually, it reminds me of a joke.

434
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:59,118
-Do you want to hear it?
-Tell me. Liven up the night.

435
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:03,320
An unmarried woman....
Wait a minute, that's not it.

436
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:06,524
-Come on, get the joke straight.
-Shut up. Let me do it.

437
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,598
An unmarried woman meets a guy...

438
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:11,281
...and he tells her he just got out of prison.

439
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,360
"What did you do?" she asks.

440
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:17,645
"I hacked my wife into 52 pieces
with a chain saw."

441
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,525
She says, "So, you're single?"

442
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,123
-That's even funnier.
-Thank you.

443
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:26,165
-Could I ask you something?
-What?

444
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,442
-What did you do?
-I knew you were going to ask.

445
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:32,964
-I hacked my wife into 52 pieces.
-I was afraid you'd say that.

446
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,641
I'm a very small person, so maybe...

447
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:38,400
Maybe I can hack you into 40 pieces.

448
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:45,918
-What did you do, really?
-No, really, but what did you do?

449
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:52,437
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant and...

450
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,518
...when they came to arrest us...

451
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,360
...this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me.

452
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:01,076
I popped the bastard,
so they gave me a little time for it.

453
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,679
I'm drinking a sea breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

454
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:09,119
You have to stay sober. If you ain't
sober, you're taking your chances.

455
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:11,198
Because I'm just one hell of an animal.

456
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,164
Yeah? Do tell.

457
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,118
Get you on this side, doll. Let's do this.

458
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,118
Who is Loretta anyway?

459
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,721
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

460
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:26,482
-I thought I was the love of your life.
-Chopped her into 52 pieces.

461
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:33,637
He hurt you like this, that married guy?

462
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:36,924
-He hurt you like this?
-I told you, we never did anything.

463
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:40,204
-He hurt you like this?
-Oh, scandal.

464
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,324
He's a rough one.

465
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,444
How's this feel?

466
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,527
Oh, my God. Am I under arrest?

467
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,916
Not quite, darlin'.

468
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:58,878
Officer, I swear, it's all a mistake.

469
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:03,517
That married guy hurt you like this?

470
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,519
Because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this!

471
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:17,238
I've got you now, bitch!

472
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,837
Dani, when did this key stop working?

473
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:32,566
What? Oh, I don't know.

474
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:36,163
No wonder. A wire's missing.

475
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:41,277
A piano wire is missing. Was somebody
fooling around with the piano?

476
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,720
What?

477
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:46,359
-Yeah?
-Mr. Bowden.

478
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:49,917
-I think we might have a little break.
-Good.

479
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,636
I can be there in a half hour.
All right, fine. Thank you.

480
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,719
-Who was that?
-Cady raped another girl.

481
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,478
Rape? You said it was battery.

482
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,127
The case was wobbly. I got it reduced.

483
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:05,516
I remember those days, old slippery Sam.

484
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,485
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to alarm you or Dani.

485
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:11,407
-Why? How old was that girl?
-16.

486
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,364
16, what?

487
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,642
My birthday is coming up.

488
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,683
Neighbors heard screams and called us.

489
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,406
When the perp drove off,
somebody made his plate.

490
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:28,364
-Max Cady.
-Great.

491
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:31,559
We got one little problem.
The girl is scared.

492
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:34,281
She's claiming she fell down some stairs.

493
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,605
Don't look at me.

494
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,803
Oh, my God.

495
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,277
You two know each other?

496
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,483
Yeah, we work together.

497
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,998
I'll be outside.

498
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,837
I'm so stupid.

499
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,685
You stood me up at the club the other day.

500
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:17,677
Then you didn't call.

501
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,483
By last night...

502
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,365
...l was feeling pretty reckless.

503
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,321
I thought about what you said, you know...

504
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:32,480
...that your wife didn't know I existed.

505
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,723
And I felt like...

506
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,116
...l was going to show you.

507
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,803
I guess I showed you, all right, didn't l?

508
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:46,640
I guess I really showed you.

509
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:54,043
Listen to me, okay?

510
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,119
Now, look, this guy Cady...

511
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,675
...he's done this kind of thing before.

512
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:03,557
Now, he's going to do this
over and over again...

513
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,844
...unless you testify
and we take him to court...

514
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,286
No.

515
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,722
And press charges and testify.

516
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:16,959
I know how it works. I see it every day.

517
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:20,325
Only this time, I'm on the other side.

518
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:24,443
I don't want to explain why I was in a bar...

519
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,918
...and how much I had to drink
and what I was wearing.

520
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,283
Not by the people I work with.

521
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:35,202
Not by the guys that I see
cross-examine other people on the stand.

522
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,116
Just crucify them.
They just laugh about it later.

523
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,917
They'll even ask about you.

524
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:46,962
Listen to me. I don't care about that.

525
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:49,686
Well, I care about that.

526
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,399
I'm sure you do, too.

527
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,963
I'm terribly sorry. I'm just terribly sorry.

528
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:07,119
If this is something personal
between you, the girl and Cady...

529
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:08,242
Personal?

530
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:12,521
All right, come on, Lieutenant.
What are you implying?

531
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,804
Only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly.

532
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:17,240
Not by the police.

533
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:21,524
This Cady is planning to rape my wife,
but it's not your problem?

534
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:23,882
I can't bust someone for planning a rape.

535
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:26,561
You're a lawyer.
You know that damn well.

536
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,478
-Thanks.
-The way I'd handle it...

537
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,876
What, file a restraining order?
I already did.

538
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,878
Just think of Cady as a tiger.

539
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,477
The trick is to get him out of the brush.
How do we do that?

540
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:39,440
You stake out a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

541
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,165
What are you suggesting?

542
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,598
That I use my family as bait?
And then what?

543
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:48,157
Hope that this psychopath
attacks my wife and child?

544
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:51,444
-Then what? Blow his head off?
-I'm a law officer.

545
00:38:51,527 --> 00:38:55,759
It would be unethical of me to advise a
citizen to take the law into his own hands.

546
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:59,762
-I suppose you must've misunderstood me.
-I guess I must've.

547
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:02,717
Well, pardon me all over the place.

548
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:29,917
And he's been harassing my family.

549
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,876
Cleverly, so that the law can't touch him.

550
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,959
I believe he's able to slip
in and out of the house undetected.

551
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,844
Although, is he out? I can't tell.

552
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:41,566
He's either out or in. I'm not sure.

553
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,000
I can't see through walls.

554
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,523
I'm not asking you to see through walls.
That's fine.

555
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,676
Why can't anybody do anything for me?
What good are cops and laws...

556
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:54,123
Sam, calm down.
Let me explain something to you.

557
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:57,046
The system is set up to handle
generalized problems...

558
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:59,243
...like burglary and robbery.

559
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,923
But if some lone creep targets you
for some obscure reason...

560
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:06,044
...the system is slow and skeptical.
Pathetic even.

561
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,836
What's your connection with this fellow?

562
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:14,360
-I was his lawyer, his public defender.
-But you shafted him somehow, right?

563
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:18,881
-At least that's the way he perceives it.
-I don't care what you did.

564
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,800
-What did he do?
-He raped a 16-year-old girl.

565
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,317
Do you have a daughter around 16?

566
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:26,915
She's 15.

567
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,126
Here's the deal.

568
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:32,597
I'll do a background check,
follow him and write up a risk assessment.

569
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:35,645
-Great. Now, the cops...
-I can find him.

570
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:39,283
-His name's Max Cady.
-Just take it easy. Stay calm.

571
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:43,035
Dani, you can just relax because...

572
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:47,076
...your daddy has a private investigator
on the payroll.

573
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:48,880
Isn't that right?

574
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,486
What's your feeling about him?
What, Sam Spade?

575
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,727
Mickey Spillane? Peter Gunn?

576
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,398
Dirty Harry? Perry Mason?

577
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:01,320
No. Perry Mason was a lawyer.

578
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:04,444
The minute I walked in
this guy's office, I felt relaxed.

579
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,358
This guy is totally in charge.

580
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,677
Kersek deals with these types for a living.

581
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,076
He looked like he was going to enjoy...

582
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,726
-Yes?
-Yeah, it's me.

583
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:19,717
After you left, I had this conversation
with a C.O. at Statesboro prison.

584
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,361
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

585
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,757
There was this other inmate
working there with him, obstinate S.O.B.

586
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:29,726
He hated Cady's cigar smoke
and was always moaning about it.

587
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:33,198
One day, they found him
with his neck broke and his tongue bit off.

588
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:34,037
Jesus.

589
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,116
Yeah.

590
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,686
They couldn’t place Cady
at the scene of the accident...

591
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,280
...if you want to call it that...

592
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,039
...at least not out loud.

593
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:48,878
But the parole board kept him in
for another seven years.

594
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:52,406
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

595
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,558
-Who was that?
-Our private eye.

596
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,558
I thought we were relaxed now.

597
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,286
New Essex County Hospital.

598
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,165
Yes, room 5036, please.

599
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,243
-One minute, please.
-All right.

600
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,715
-Hello?
-Hi, Lori, it's me.

601
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:11,958
I just feel God-awful
you got dragged into this thing.

602
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,321
It's not your fault.

603
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:18,197
If I had any idea that Cady would hurt you
to get at me, I would have warned you.

604
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,847
Yeah, I know. I'm glad you called.

605
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:22,804
Yeah, well.

606
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:26,357
-I'm so sorry about this.
-I feel the same way.

607
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:31,556
Are you really determined
about moving back to Connecticut?

608
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:33,524
I've thought about it a lot.

609
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:36,280
I just think it's probably the best thing.

610
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,526
I thought that maybe
I could go back to school.

611
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:42,043
I'm really going to miss you.

612
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,080
Right. Excuse me.

613
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,442
-That sounds real good.
-Yeah.

614
00:42:46,527 --> 00:42:50,361
-That'll work out fine. I'll get back to you.
-All right, 'bye.

615
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:57,644
Well, I just don't know what I hate more:

616
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:02,518
That insipid tone
or your stupid, sophomoric infidelities.

617
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:04,606
Who was that?

618
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,242
-The girl that got beat up?
-Yes, it was.

619
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:11,683
I already told you.
She's a clerk at the county courthouse.

620
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:14,960
And what? You're fucking her?

621
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:19,596
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.

622
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:23,441
Why is it that whenever I have
a private phone conversation...

623
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:25,995
...you assume that I'm fucking someone?

624
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:29,760
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

625
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:33,760
Yes, that's why he chose her.
But I'm not fucking her in any way.

626
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:38,964
Well, you sleazy son of a bitch!

627
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:42,996
Stop it!

628
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,364
Dani is right downstairs.

629
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:50,766
-Honey, there's nothing the matter.
-Yeah, I can see, Dad.

630
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:55,117
I thought you promised
to leave all that shit behind in Atlanta.

631
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:07,002
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty little secrets...

632
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:09,078
...in those sessions with Dr. Hackett.

633
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:12,159
-We talked that one incident to death.
-Why did you bother?

634
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:15,364
-Because you asked me to go.
-I mean, why did you bother?

635
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,726
Why did you bother with you and me?
With the marriage?

636
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,076
Uprooting me and Dani? Moving?

637
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,876
Because that's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out.

638
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,435
-What is it I don't get?
-You don't get it.

639
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:36,277
Nadine?

640
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:38,641
It's Dani.

641
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:41,196
Nothing.

642
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:44,756
I'm just losing my mind here.

643
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:49,482
You know, had the balls to walk out,
if that's what you wanted.

644
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:52,400
Like I was going to split,
with you acting the way you act.

645
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:55,001
Acting? You did some acting.

646
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:56,805
I don't remember acting.

647
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:59,799
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.

648
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:03,926
Remember not working for three months?
Not fixing any meals?

649
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:05,918
I'm not on fucking trial here!

650
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:10,478
Do you remember crying every morning
afternoon, evening? Remember that?

651
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:15,160
I scared you, huh?

652
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,245
What did you think, Sam?

653
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:21,721
You thought maybe
I was going to kill myself?

654
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:23,845
-Over you?
-Who else?

655
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:25,440
You pompous ass.

656
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:28,246
You wouldn't leave the bedroom!

657
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:32,764
-I wish you could say the same.
-This what Dr. Hackett talked about.

658
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,360
Digging up the past.

659
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,203
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messing around in New Essex.

660
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:41,766
And I have not been.

661
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:45,283
As far as this girl goes, she's just a kid.

662
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,641
That shouldn't stop you.

663
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:50,515
She's a baby. You gravitate
to people in the same profession as you.

664
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,046
You gravitate to women.

665
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:55,563
Come on, I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

666
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:58,286
She's just infatuated. I can't help that.

667
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,279
Look, Leigh, I'm scared.

668
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:08,118
This whole thing has....

669
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,926
I keep feeling that there
is some animal out there stalking us.

670
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:16,886
I think he wants to hurt us
in the worst way...

671
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:20,476
...and that's got me frightened to death.

672
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:27,361
-You really are scared, aren't you?
-Yeah.

673
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:29,483
Somebody finally got to you.

674
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,725
Look, I think...

675
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:37,596
...he beat and raped her because he knew
that she wouldn't testify...

676
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,682
...that she wouldn't press charges...

677
00:46:41,127 --> 00:46:42,879
...because she knows the system.

678
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,764
I mean, she works in it.

679
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,883
She knows that she'd be on trial.

680
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:52,203
Then, because she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that...

681
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,847
...there was something
going on between us...

682
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:57,684
...and it would cause a rift.

683
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,921
That we'd be much more vulnerable to him.

684
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:12,916
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.

685
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:16,602
We can beat that son of a bitch,
the two of us, working as a team.

686
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,600
Jesus Christ.

687
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:26,035
Yeah, this is great. This is something else.

688
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:29,126
Oh, shit!

689
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:42,119
-Here you go.
-I'm sorry, I haven't ordered yet.

690
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:45,085
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for and all.

691
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,122
Who?

692
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:49,281
-Which one?
-That guy who is just leaving.

693
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:54,196
Excuse me.

694
00:47:55,927 --> 00:47:57,280
Cady, come here.

695
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:58,961
Wait up a second.

696
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:02,405
I've been in a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

697
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,207
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

698
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:07,244
-No.
-Get the hell out of here.

699
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,566
I don't mean this town,
I mean the whole state.

700
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,601
I don't want to see you or hear you
and I don't want to smell you. Leave.

701
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:16,240
Are you my friend?

702
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:17,960
No, I'm not your friend.

703
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:22,438
I thought maybe you were because I like to
plan my comings and goings with friends.

704
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,758
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.

705
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,556
In fact, I'd call it downright rude,
because I ain't your porch-baby, buddy.

706
00:48:29,647 --> 00:48:34,402
Gee golly gosh. I'm sorry I offended you,
you white trash piece of shit.

707
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:37,043
I got the all-over fidgets on that one.

708
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:40,005
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

709
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:44,884
It's not necessary to lay
a foul tongue on me, my friend.

710
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:48,243
I could get upset.
Things could get out of hand.

711
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,007
Then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you...

712
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:53,043
...that you would not like, right here.

713
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:56,642
-Anytime you feel squirrelly, you just jump.
-You threatening me?

714
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:00,646
You catch on fast.

715
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:04,040
I'm well within my rights
to be here and you know it.

716
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:08,086
-If I stay here, what you going to do?
-I don't give a rat's ass about your rights.

717
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,397
Watch your step,
you know what I'm talking about.

718
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:13,479
You going to arrest me?
You a cop? Or were you a cop?

719
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:15,876
Were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

720
00:49:16,047 --> 00:49:18,163
That's the feeling I'm getting here.

721
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,558
Hope you enjoyed your breakfast.

722
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,286
Ma'am, this belong to you?

723
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:34,483
-Can I help you?
-I just found it.

724
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:36,963
Thought you might need it back.

725
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:40,960
Not to frighten you, but if a dogcatcher
comes across a dog without a license...

726
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:44,562
...he's liable to think he's a stray
and do God knows what to it.

727
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:46,566
You know...

728
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,080
...our dog is....

729
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,883
-He passed away.
-What a shame.

730
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:54,767
Man's best friend and all. Woman's too.

731
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,481
Even without closing my eyes,
I can picture him...

732
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:02,116
...big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet...

733
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:07,321
...keeping you company while you're trying
to finish up those pesky little sketches.

734
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:12,482
You're Max Cady, aren't you?

735
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:18,043
You better get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

736
00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:19,561
I'm not doing nothing.

737
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:22,480
Just giving back your dog collar.
I'm not on your property.

738
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,717
What'd you come out here for,
to look around?

739
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,037
Go ahead, Mr. Cady, take a good look.

740
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,562
Nice house.

741
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,605
It is a nice house.
You satisfied now you've seen it?

742
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:34,640
Or is there more?

743
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:37,522
Is that it?

744
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:39,957
There is going to be more, isn't there?

745
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:42,242
You won't stop until you're happy.

746
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,885
How can I be happy
when you're not happy?

747
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,884
You don't know anything about me.

748
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:51,527
-I know what I see, ma'am.
-Yeah?

749
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,958
I wanted to know what you looked like.

750
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:58,403
I've been waiting to see your face,
but now that I see you...

751
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:01,598
...you are just repulsive.

752
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:03,486
-I understand.
-Yeah.

753
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:07,355
I'm not your type.
All that prison time made me coarse.

754
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:09,957
Guess I'm covered in too many tattoos?

755
00:51:10,687 --> 00:51:15,203
But there's not a whole lot
to do in prison but desecrate your flesh.

756
00:51:15,607 --> 00:51:17,962
It didn't have to be that way
for either of us...

757
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:20,607
...if your husband hadn't betrayed us both.

758
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:23,357
Who knows?
We might have been different people.

759
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,007
We might have been happy, Leigh.

760
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:29,238
-Mom, someone's on the phone!
-Dani!

761
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:31,206
Don't come out here!

762
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:43,396
Sam.

763
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,324
I thought I'd catch you here.

764
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:50,003
-That little smart aleck made me.
-He what?

765
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,647
It wasn't my fault.
He was looking to be covered.

766
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,287
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.

767
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:57,517
-I told you.
-You know where he was today?

768
00:51:57,607 --> 00:52:00,201
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra...

769
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,801
...by Friedrich Nietzsche,
the German philosopher.

770
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,321
-He said that God is dead.
-God is dead. Right.

771
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:08,838
We can keep going this way,
but it's going to get expensive.

772
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:13,636
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.

773
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:16,287
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?

774
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,484
-Yes, I'd love to resolve it.
-Then I got a suggestion.

775
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:24,405
There are men that can be hired, by me,
to do a little hospital job on Cady.

776
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:29,999
What are we talking about here?

777
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:32,396
Two pieces of pipe and a bicycle chain.

778
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:36,565
He won't be so scary after that.

779
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:38,763
I'm a lawyer. Are we agreed on that?

780
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:42,358
Maybe 2,000 years ago,
we'd have stoned him to death.

781
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:46,122
I can't operate outside the law.
The law is my business.

782
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:55,045
-I'm home! Where is everybody?
-In here.

783
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:59,125
'Evening, ladies. Oh, chicken.

784
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:03,078
How is everything? Ls everything okay?

785
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:04,885
-Yeah.
-Good.

786
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:11,320
He was here today.

787
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:21,161
-Hello?
-Hello, Danielle?

788
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:23,876
-Is this Miss Danielle Bowden?
-Yeah.

789
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,198
This is your new teacher calling.

790
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,676
-From English or Drama?
-Drama.

791
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:31,523
-So how you doing?
-Fine.

792
00:53:31,847 --> 00:53:35,476
I'm just going down the list,
greeting my summer students.

793
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:37,400
You sound kind of down.

794
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:43,078
There's just been stuff
going on around here, that's all.

795
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,603
-Anything I can do?
-I doubt it.

796
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:48,759
Shit happens, you know,
like the t-shirt says.

797
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:49,836
Yeah.

798
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:54,966
You know, all that negativity,
you can use that.

799
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,000
What do you mean?

800
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:01,757
I'm the kind of teacher that takes
a very personal interest in his kids.

801
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:05,806
Don't mind me. Everything you're
going through, it's okay, go with it.

802
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:08,401
The awkwardness you feel,
walking down the street...

803
00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:11,445
...and some leering fool is
making fun of your sexuality...

804
00:54:11,527 --> 00:54:15,486
...the turmoil you feel, extra bad when
that time of the month comes around...

805
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:17,762
...the anger you feel
that your mom and dad...

806
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:20,919
...won't let you grow up
and be yourself, be a woman.

807
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:25,600
Don't suppress or deny it.
Use it in your life and work.

808
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:29,199
Okay. I mean....

809
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:33,517
I'll have to think about all that.

810
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:38,240
Class is tomorrow in Room 110, right?

811
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,122
No, it's been changed to the theater.

812
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:44,324
-What better place for Drama, right?
-Yeah.

813
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:51,076
And remember, Danielle, you can use
all those fears to draw upon and learn.

814
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:53,805
You know this little tune?

815
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:57,882
"If you want a do right

816
00:54:57,967 --> 00:54:59,480
"All days

817
00:55:00,887 --> 00:55:02,320
"woman

818
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,041
"You've gotta be a

819
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:08,322
"do right

820
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:12,082
"All night man"

821
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:19,446
You can trust in me,
because I'm a do right man, okay?

822
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:23,046
Okay, 'night now.

823
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:26,042
Okay. Good night.

824
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,557
Honey, I think maybe I should walk you in.

825
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:35,957
No, it's okay, Mom.
There are a lot of people here.

826
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:38,083
I'll be right here at 4:00 to pick you up.

827
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,123
-Okay.
-'Bye.

828
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,800
I didn't think summer sessions
would be so crowded.

829
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:48,516
They're just having a big meeting
about next fall's chorus program.

830
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,197
-I have to go downstairs for Drama.
-Okay, 'bye.

831
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:37,200
Hello.

832
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:42,926
Nadine?

833
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:59,362
I'm here for the Drama class.

834
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:09,322
Am I busted?

835
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,565
-No.
-I hope not.

836
00:57:11,967 --> 00:57:14,435
You can't smoke grass in school.

837
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,518
Privilege of the profession.

838
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:19,955
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

839
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:21,237
Yeah.

840
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,677
Are you the Drama teacher?

841
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:25,998
And you're, let me guess.

842
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:30,326
Cecile James?

843
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:34,116
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

844
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:36,602
Danielle. Oh, we spoke last night.

845
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:38,206
Yeah.

846
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:40,763
Oh, I'm sorry. How rude.

847
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:43,281
It's okay.

848
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:50,797
"I think we're alone now"

849
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:56,081
Okay.

850
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:09,847
Thanks. Here.

851
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:12,079
I'm going to give this to you.

852
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,563
Little trick I learned. Take it.

853
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:24,641
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

854
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,322
You really made sense to me.

855
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,399
I thought a lot.

856
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:35,126
Those are human truths.
That's what it's all about.

857
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,277
And that's what we deal with here.

858
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,963
See the book you have, Thomas Wolfe?

859
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:43,166
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

860
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:47,162
I like the end...

861
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:51,078
...where Eugene's journey was really...

862
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:53,399
...mystical, you know?

863
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:56,765
It was almost like a pilgrimage.

864
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,803
Almost like a cop-out, if you ask me.

865
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:02,401
Though those were the facts of Wolfe's life.

866
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:06,246
The novel is what you would call
a roman à clef.

867
00:59:06,327 --> 00:59:07,885
You know what that is?

868
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:11,245
Sure.

869
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:15,081
Well, nonetheless, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

870
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,764
Although writers do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

871
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,361
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read his trilogy?

872
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:23,485
Plexus, Nexus and Sexus?

873
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,604
-You haven't read that?
-No.

874
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:29,199
You're missing something.

875
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:34,278
You know what?
I did read Tropic of Cancer.

876
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:36,365
Just parts of it, though...

877
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:40,156
...because I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

878
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:45,556
His descriptions are pretty vivid,
I would say.

879
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:47,877
In one of the novels, I don't recall which...

880
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:51,437
...he describes an erection
as a piece of lead with wings on it.

881
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:55,322
-I didn't read that part.
-Of course not. You're not allowed.

882
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,365
Your parents don't want you
to achieve adulthood.

883
00:59:58,447 --> 01:00:01,484
They know the pitfalls of adulthood,
all that freedom.

884
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:03,364
They know it only too well.

885
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:07,359
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt and anger onto you...

886
01:00:07,447 --> 01:00:10,723
...for a crime that's not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

887
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:17,639
Wait a second.

888
01:00:18,887 --> 01:00:20,479
Where are you from?

889
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:22,756
Where am I from?

890
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:24,917
-Yeah.
-Where do you think I'm from?

891
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:26,999
I don't know, but...

892
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:29,396
If I told you, you going to get mad at me?

893
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:38,922
I'm from the black forest.

894
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:44,165
That's funny.

895
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:47,725
You're not the Drama teacher, are you?

896
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,439
Maybe I'm the big bad wolf.

897
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:58,597
So you're that guy that's been
hanging around the house?

898
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:01,561
You're the one that killed my mom's dog?

899
01:01:02,887 --> 01:01:05,162
-Your mom's dog was killed?
-Yeah.

900
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:08,156
I didn't even know anything about that.

901
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:09,846
That's a shame.

902
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,285
That's a damn shame.

903
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:14,080
Yes, it was.

904
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:16,045
What kind of dog was it?

905
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,804
I don't know. He was just....

906
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:21,926
He was fluffy, and....

907
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:23,881
Fluffy?

908
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,205
So you didn't do that?

909
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:32,483
Of course I didn't do that.

910
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:39,596
-Okay.
-I wouldn't do that.

911
01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:43,041
So why.... What are you doing here, then?

912
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:46,358
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

913
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:52,327
-Why? I mean...
-Because...

914
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:56,724
...l wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

915
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:59,880
I see you're a nice person. That's all.

916
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:06,603
-You're not going to hurt me, are you?
-I'm not going to hurt you at all.

917
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:08,757
There's no hurting here, Danielle.

918
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:13,763
Between us there's no anger, nothing.
Just a search for truth.

919
01:02:16,327 --> 01:02:20,115
Did you judge me, get angry at me
when you caught me smoking the grass?

920
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:22,276
No.

921
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:27,482
But your parents judged you.
Got plenty angry at you, didn't they?

922
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:29,240
Yeah.

923
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:31,717
They punished you for their sins.

924
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:34,160
What did they do?

925
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:39,996
My dad....
They just yelled a whole lot and...

926
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:42,315
...my mom cried...

927
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:45,604
...and my dad said
I couldn't drive the Cherokee.

928
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:49,362
I'd say they punished you
for their sins, and you resent that...

929
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:51,278
...and you should resent it.

930
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:55,125
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

931
01:02:55,847 --> 01:02:58,077
You shouldn't damn them.
Don't judge them.

932
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:00,920
Just forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

933
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:05,478
Why do you hate my father?

934
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:09,116
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

935
01:03:09,607 --> 01:03:11,165
I'm here to help him.

936
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:14,683
We all make mistakes, Danielle.

937
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,721
You and I have. At least we try to admit it.

938
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,315
Don't we?

939
01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:20,882
Yeah.

940
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,165
But your daddy, he don't.

941
01:03:24,327 --> 01:03:28,036
Every man carries a circle of hell
around his head like a halo.

942
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:30,403
Your daddy, too. Every man...

943
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,720
...has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

944
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:36,799
You know what paradise is?

945
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,160
-No.
-Salvation.

946
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:42,598
'Cause your daddy's not happy.

947
01:03:42,687 --> 01:03:44,325
Your mommy's not happy.

948
01:03:44,607 --> 01:03:47,599
And you know what? You're not happy.

949
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:51,322
-Are you?
-No, I'm not.

950
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:58,521
You thought about me last night,
didn't you?

951
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,526
Yes, I did.

952
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:06,196
I know.

953
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:11,884
You know, I think
I might have found a companion...

954
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:15,761
...for that long walk to the light.

955
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:21,316
Do you mind if I put my arm around you?

956
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:35,516
It's okay.

957
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,121
No, I don't mind.

958
01:04:40,207 --> 01:04:41,435
Okay.

959
01:06:05,447 --> 01:06:09,235
Kersek, where the hell have you been?
He came at my daughter at school.

960
01:06:09,327 --> 01:06:12,603
You asked me to watch him nights.
I'm watching nights. What happened?

961
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:16,362
My wife, Leigh, found some marijuana
in one of Dani's schoolbooks.

962
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,007
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or what happened.

963
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:21,123
She's scared and she won't talk about it.

964
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:23,482
But this has gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

965
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:26,161
-You phone the cops?
-No, I didn't phone the cops.

966
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:29,239
What did you call them?
"Slow, skeptical pathetic, even."

967
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:32,559
No, Leigh, that's all right.
Just hold on a minute.

968
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:35,557
Kersek...

969
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:39,435
...l want to hire those three guys,
you remember, the hospital job.

970
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:42,280
Consider it done, the sooner the better.

971
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:44,364
Three men are going to cost you a grand.

972
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:47,200
It's not chicken feed
but you don't go with less than three.

973
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:48,925
It's better to overdo it.

974
01:06:49,007 --> 01:06:50,998
You'll have the money in the morning.

975
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:53,521
We'll be on for tomorrow night.
And Sam...

976
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,803
...you'll feel good about this.

977
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:00,476
All right.

978
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:15,077
Do you notice these young people?

979
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,806
They don't look very happy.

980
01:07:16,887 --> 01:07:20,880
They're committed to their professions
and ambitions but not to each other.

981
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:22,639
Cady, shut up and listen.

982
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:25,999
If you don't leave...

983
01:07:26,287 --> 01:07:30,121
...my family alone
and you don't get out of here...

984
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:33,525
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

985
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:37,358
-Could you repeat that?
-I said...

986
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,517
...if you don't get out of here...

987
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:42,605
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

988
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,120
-A threat?
-Yeah.

989
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,084
You bet your ass that's a threat.

990
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,839
I have thought of relocating...

991
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,725
...where I'd be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

992
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:53,480
...l could teach earthquake preparedness.

993
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:57,443
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex, Counselor.

994
01:07:58,487 --> 01:08:01,877
I mean, where else could I just
casually confer with an old colleague?

995
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:05,084
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?

996
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,767
-You think you're better than me.
-No, I don't.

997
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:09,439
That's not the goddamned point.

998
01:08:09,527 --> 01:08:13,122
Good. If you're not better than me
then I can have what you have.

999
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:16,286
-What do I have?
-A wife, a daughter.

1000
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:21,440
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1001
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:25,961
Fourteen years ago, I was forced to make
a commitment to an eight-by-nine cell...

1002
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:29,039
...and now you're going to be forced
to make a commitment.

1003
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:31,243
You could say I'm here to save you.

1004
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:35,362
Fine.

1005
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:38,719
Check out the Bible, Counselor...

1006
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:41,082
...the book between Esther and Psalms.

1007
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:52,401
You all right?

1008
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:55,643
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

1009
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,442
This isn't going to work, you know.

1010
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:05,566
-What isn't going to work?
-Locking us in, hiding us from the world.

1011
01:09:05,647 --> 01:09:07,444
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dani.

1012
01:09:07,527 --> 01:09:11,281
-Making me stay out of school.
-You're going back to school tomorrow.

1013
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,756
And put some clothes on.
You're not a kid anymore.

1014
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:17,635
Why am I going back to school tomorrow?
What are you going to do?

1015
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:19,797
That's none of your concern, Dani.

1016
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,196
Dad...

1017
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:27,000
...he didn't force himself on me, you know.

1018
01:09:27,527 --> 01:09:29,836
I know you'd like to think that he did.

1019
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:32,597
But I think he was....

1020
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:36,205
I think he was just trying
to make a connection with me.

1021
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:38,005
-You know?
-Now, Dani...

1022
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:40,203
...l want you to listen to me.

1023
01:09:40,727 --> 01:09:42,479
No. Do you understand?

1024
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:47,722
There will never be any connection
between you...

1025
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:49,566
...and Max Cady.

1026
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,566
You understand that?

1027
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:03,526
Did he touch you?

1028
01:10:06,087 --> 01:10:07,918
What are you laughing about?

1029
01:10:08,327 --> 01:10:09,680
Why are you smiling?

1030
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:12,281
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1031
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:15,118
Dani, wipe that smile off your face!

1032
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:17,198
I'm asking you did he touch you?

1033
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:26,566
Oh, wait, Dani. I'm sorry.

1034
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:30,765
Wait, honey. I'm sorry.

1035
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:32,599
Get out of here!

1036
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:39,005
Come on.

1037
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,120
Counselor?

1038
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:16,206
Is that you?

1039
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:22,685
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1040
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:38,358
I ain't no white trash piece of shit.

1041
01:12:38,447 --> 01:12:40,597
I'm better than you all.

1042
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:45,243
I can out-learn you.

1043
01:12:46,287 --> 01:12:48,164
I can out-read you.

1044
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:52,957
I can out think you,
and I can out-philosophize you.

1045
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,322
And I'm going to outlast you.

1046
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:59,525
You think a couple whacks to my
good-old-boy gut will get me down?

1047
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:02,167
It's going to take a hell of a lot
more than that...

1048
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,477
...to prove you're better than me!

1049
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:10,606
"I am like God, and God like me.

1050
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:13,281
"I am as large as God.

1051
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:16,245
"He is as small as l.

1052
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:20,718
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be."

1053
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:25,763
Silesius, 17th century.

1054
01:13:37,127 --> 01:13:38,958
Could you be there?

1055
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:57,678
I wonder if you're here.

1056
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:08,040
Ah, fuck it.

1057
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:12,046
If you're here,
what the fuck is the difference?

1058
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:14,355
Fuck it!

1059
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:27,040
-I've got Mr. Kersek on one.
-Good. I'll take it.

1060
01:14:28,487 --> 01:14:30,478
Sam, you look tired. You get that writ?

1061
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,286
No, we have to get into that.
Let me just grab this.

1062
01:14:33,567 --> 01:14:35,717
-Kersek.
-I'm damn sorry about last night.

1063
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:38,275
That son of a bitch could survive
a nuclear strike.

1064
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:39,516
Hang on a second.

1065
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:41,916
Tom, I'm not doing it. I pulled a fast one...

1066
01:14:42,007 --> 01:14:44,237
...and it's come back and bit me on the ass.

1067
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:48,366
What you did was dumb. What I'm asking
is no big deal. This is my daughter!

1068
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,917
No, it's perjury.
It's bullshit and I'm not doing it!

1069
01:14:52,007 --> 01:14:54,123
-All right?
-I'll be in my office.

1070
01:14:54,207 --> 01:14:55,959
Who was that top criminal lawyer?

1071
01:14:56,047 --> 01:14:58,322
Lee Heller. We need to talk.

1072
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:01,080
If word gets out how Cady
bushwhacked those bastards...

1073
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,919
...it'll be hard to get three new guys.

1074
01:15:03,007 --> 01:15:05,237
I don't want three new guys.
You hear me?

1075
01:15:05,327 --> 01:15:09,366
Mr. Heller, it's Sam Bowden
from Broadbent and Denmeyer.

1076
01:15:09,447 --> 01:15:13,486
Tom speaks very highly of you. He says
you're the best, and that's what I need.

1077
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:16,923
We froze our butts together in Korea.
How can I help you, Sam?

1078
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:21,398
It's a petition for a restraining order,
but there have been complications.

1079
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:24,797
I know this is short notice,
but I need this injunction.

1080
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:28,641
There's an ex-convict named Max Cady
who's been harassing my family.

1081
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:31,924
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue this conversation.

1082
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:36,205
-Is there a more convenient time?
-The damn thing is, I have a conflict.

1083
01:15:36,287 --> 01:15:37,925
-What would that be?
-You see...

1084
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:40,805
...Mr. Cady retained my services yesterday.

1085
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:43,799
-He what?
-In fact, I see on my phone sheet...

1086
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:46,924
...Mr. Cady called this morning,
so I'm sure he'll fill me in...

1087
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:50,079
But wait a minute, Lee.
This man is a psychotic.

1088
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:53,603
It appears I'll be seeing you
at that hearing after all.

1089
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:59,166
-Could you repeat that?
-I said, "If you don’t leave...

1090
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:03,560
"...my family alone
and if you don't get out of here...

1091
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:06,684
"...you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed."

1092
01:16:07,287 --> 01:16:11,803
-A threat?
-You bet your ass that's a threat.

1093
01:16:11,887 --> 01:16:15,721
You need only glance
at my client to know...

1094
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:21,966
...that Mr. Bowden made good
on his heinous and cowardly threat.

1095
01:16:22,607 --> 01:16:26,486
Just as God arose to judgment
to save all the meek of the earth...

1096
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:29,406
...l hope and pray you will do the same, sir.

1097
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:31,000
Your honor...

1098
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:34,878
...Mr. Cady wouldn't have
surreptitiously taped our meeting...

1099
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:36,844
...unless he knew that he'd...

1100
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:42,440
This court does not condone...

1101
01:16:43,127 --> 01:16:46,881
...feuds, vendettas or vigilantism.

1102
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:52,203
Let me quote our great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1103
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:56,960
"I will let no man drag me down so low...

1104
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,602
"...as to make me hate him."

1105
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:01,677
Yes.

1106
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:04,961
I will grant the restraining order...

1107
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:08,483
...not to validate the malice between you...

1108
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:13,402
...but in the interest of Christian harmony.

1109
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:17,845
You may not come within 500 yards...

1110
01:17:17,927 --> 01:17:22,364
...of Mr. Maximilian Cady...

1111
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:27,962
...until such time as the court
may lift the injunction.

1112
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:32,997
King Solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely, your honor.

1113
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:38,118
I am so offended by the Philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden...

1114
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:41,962
...l petitioned the A.B.A.
For his disbarment...

1115
01:17:42,447 --> 01:17:44,836
...on the grounds of moral turpitude.

1116
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,999
Now, if you will excuse us, my client...

1117
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:50,840
...is due back at the hospital...

1118
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:57,559
...for the results of his numerous x-rays.

1119
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,400
Kersek, I want a gun.

1120
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:03,876
-I need a gun. I want a gun.
-You want a gun?

1121
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:05,400
Yeah, I need a gun.

1122
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:09,043
-Know anything about guns?
-I don't believe in them. Not in the house.

1123
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:11,846
I'll get you a gun. What kind?
Now, calm down.

1124
01:18:12,127 --> 01:18:15,278
-Something simple I can handle.
-Let me see what fits you.

1125
01:18:15,367 --> 01:18:18,006
Forty-five....
Let me see your hands.

1126
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:22,316
-A .38 snub-nosed special.
-All right. Good.

1127
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:24,318
I can teach you how to use it.

1128
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:26,523
-Great.
-The first lesson is this...

1129
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:28,922
...don't think of it as trying to kill a man.

1130
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:30,963
-Right.
-It's an extension of your fist.

1131
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:33,117
You're just reaching out
and knocking him down.

1132
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:34,765
Boom. All right.

1133
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:37,361
Later on we'll shoot some trees, okay?

1134
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:39,085
That'd be great. Good.

1135
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,285
What is it? What?

1136
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:44,880
-Well, Sam...
-Yeah?

1137
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,401
I give you a gun. You pull it on Cady...

1138
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:51,406
...it will dawn on you that shooting
a man is different than shooting a tree.

1139
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:53,398
Next thing, you know, Cady has the gun.

1140
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:57,400
You'll teach me. I could handle a gun.
He won't take it away.

1141
01:18:57,687 --> 01:19:00,406
Best-case scenario:
You kill Cady dog-dead.

1142
01:19:01,527 --> 01:19:04,519
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that, Counselor?

1143
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,920
Oh, Jesus! It's all fucked up, Kersek!

1144
01:19:13,767 --> 01:19:17,043
I mean, the law considers me
more of a loose cannon than Max Cady!

1145
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:21,279
Some big-shit attorney has whipped the
A.B.A.'s ethics committee into a frenzy.

1146
01:19:21,847 --> 01:19:24,725
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1147
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,479
How did they link that to you?

1148
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:30,719
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was the decent thing to do.

1149
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:33,958
Maybe I'd scare him. He was wired.

1150
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:38,124
Goddamn fools.

1151
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:43,642
This hearing, it's real important?

1152
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:49,565
Only if I want to continue to practice law.

1153
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:51,717
Cady isn't expected there, is he?

1154
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:54,398
Mr. Cady, he's beyond reproach.

1155
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:56,876
-But you're required to be there.
-Yeah.

1156
01:19:57,367 --> 01:20:00,279
-When is this hearing?
-It's Thursday morning, 9:00.

1157
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:03,241
The torture begins and lasts for two days.

1158
01:20:04,287 --> 01:20:06,437
You have to fly up the night before?

1159
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:07,682
Right.

1160
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:12,202
Cady's an opportunist.
If he thinks you're gone for two days...

1161
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:15,279
...that's going to be as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

1162
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:17,245
If Cady breaks into your home...

1163
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:18,806
...he can be killed.

1164
01:20:18,887 --> 01:20:20,036
Justifiably.

1165
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:25,317
But he won't show unless
he's sure you won't be there.

1166
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:33,841
-Have a good trip.
-All right. Bye-bye.

1167
01:21:33,927 --> 01:21:35,997
-Call us tonight, okay?
-All right.

1168
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:50,160
-I didn't miss the 9:20 to Raleigh?
-I'm afraid you did. There's a 10:20.

1169
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,121
It's not that. I have some
important papers for Samuel Bowden.

1170
01:21:54,647 --> 01:21:56,080
Was he on the 9:20?

1171
01:21:56,647 --> 01:21:59,036
We can't give out that information, sir.

1172
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,765
Well, it's just...

1173
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,282
...l guess I could send it to him overnight...

1174
01:22:03,367 --> 01:22:06,996
...but he might be back, for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and l....

1175
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:09,560
See, l....

1176
01:22:09,647 --> 01:22:12,923
My wife and I have been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

1177
01:22:13,007 --> 01:22:16,920
If I don't get in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

1178
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:19,601
We've already lost our little daughter Dani.

1179
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:22,082
Is....

1180
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:27,600
Is there any way to know if he was
on that flight and when he's returning?

1181
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:29,484
It'd really help us.

1182
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:41,881
He'll be back the day after tomorrow, sir.

1183
01:22:41,967 --> 01:22:43,320
Bless your heart.

1184
01:22:58,647 --> 01:22:59,921
Go on in.

1185
01:23:02,287 --> 01:23:03,481
Get down, Sam.

1186
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:11,400
Give me a cigarette.

1187
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:15,517
Slow down. You're outpacing me
two-to-one since you started again.

1188
01:23:15,607 --> 01:23:17,882
Just keep track of how many I owe you.

1189
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:22,275
-How'd it go at the airport?
-We did our thing...

1190
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:25,359
...but we don't know if he saw us,
or if he was there.

1191
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,919
Set the trap and we'll see.

1192
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:30,046
What if we don't want to see?

1193
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:31,480
-Dani!
-What?

1194
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:33,598
Maybe he poisoned the dog.

1195
01:23:33,687 --> 01:23:35,643
Sam, watch out for the windows.

1196
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:38,161
You're not allowed to stand up, remember?

1197
01:23:44,927 --> 01:23:47,316
-Didn't Cady go after her?
-You don't know Dani.

1198
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:50,922
If she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom,
she takes it outside.

1199
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:53,357
You know, she could never kill anything.

1200
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:55,324
Even a six-foot palmetto bug?

1201
01:23:57,847 --> 01:23:59,200
Oh, God.

1202
01:24:07,527 --> 01:24:08,721
What is that?

1203
01:24:09,727 --> 01:24:12,878
It's mono filament line.
I got it from Sam's fishing gear.

1204
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,635
I stretch it across the windows
and the doors...

1205
01:24:15,727 --> 01:24:17,718
...and tie it to Dani's teddy bear here.

1206
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:22,597
If the bear moves a quarter of an inch,
I know if the holy ghost is sneaking in.

1207
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:53,085
What are you reading?

1208
01:24:57,567 --> 01:24:59,797
-Why? Did Kersek quit?
-No.

1209
01:25:00,607 --> 01:25:02,325
It's just that Cady said...

1210
01:25:02,487 --> 01:25:04,045
You want some answers.

1211
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:07,040
Me, too.

1212
01:25:09,007 --> 01:25:11,475
I'd like to know just how strong we are...

1213
01:25:12,447 --> 01:25:13,675
...or how weak.

1214
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:19,557
But I guess the only way
we're going to find that out is by...

1215
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:21,325
...going through this.

1216
01:25:24,927 --> 01:25:28,556
It's just that Cady said to read the book
between Esther and Psalms.

1217
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:31,005
Which is which one?

1218
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:32,806
The book of Job.

1219
01:25:35,807 --> 01:25:38,560
Job was a good man. He believed in God...

1220
01:25:39,647 --> 01:25:41,478
...and God tested his faith.

1221
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:44,197
He took away everything he had...

1222
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:47,360
...even his children.

1223
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:05,767
It's hideous, this plan. I mean, barbaric.

1224
01:26:06,247 --> 01:26:09,045
They're crazy.
My dad's turned into some kind of...

1225
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,516
I don't know what.

1226
01:26:10,607 --> 01:26:11,756
Barbaric.

1227
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:19,199
Listen to your father.
Do what they say. What else can you do?

1228
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:21,198
Leave. We could go to the houseboat...

1229
01:26:21,287 --> 01:26:23,676
...you know, and get lost in any inlet.

1230
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:29,841
Dani, come on.

1231
01:26:30,527 --> 01:26:31,960
Don't stay outside.

1232
01:26:38,767 --> 01:26:41,235
Do you want to know
what really disturbs me?

1233
01:26:41,887 --> 01:26:43,400
Killing this guy.

1234
01:26:44,327 --> 01:26:46,158
I mean, taking a man's life.

1235
01:26:48,047 --> 01:26:50,277
I don't know if I can live with that.

1236
01:26:50,927 --> 01:26:52,326
You may have to.

1237
01:26:52,847 --> 01:26:55,486
-Sam, just remember the plan.
-I know the plan.

1238
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:58,076
Damn, it's premeditated.

1239
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:01,684
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1240
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:04,125
It's also excessive force.

1241
01:27:04,207 --> 01:27:06,767
The only thing excessive
we could do to Cady...

1242
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,281
...would be to gut him and eat his liver.

1243
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:10,800
That might be excessive.

1244
01:27:10,887 --> 01:27:12,923
Jesus Christ, Kersek, I'm serious.

1245
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:15,238
No, you're scared.

1246
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:16,886
But that's okay.

1247
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:19,278
I want you to savor that fear.

1248
01:27:19,887 --> 01:27:21,878
You know, the South evolved in fear...

1249
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:24,276
...fear of the Indian, fear of the slave...

1250
01:27:24,367 --> 01:27:26,085
...fear of the damn Union.

1251
01:27:27,007 --> 01:27:29,726
The South has a fine tradition
of savoring fear.

1252
01:27:47,087 --> 01:27:48,486
What's the matter?

1253
01:27:49,127 --> 01:27:50,765
Don't look over!

1254
01:27:51,607 --> 01:27:53,245
She's making me nervous.

1255
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:56,239
What would she normally do...

1256
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,477
...if Sam wasn't around to run her home?

1257
01:27:58,567 --> 01:28:00,319
-She'd stay...
-She'd stay over.

1258
01:28:00,407 --> 01:28:02,159
Well, then, she stays over.

1259
01:30:32,287 --> 01:30:33,720
-What?
-Leigh.

1260
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:35,845
I know how the dog died.

1261
01:30:37,247 --> 01:30:38,965
-Sam, are you dreaming?
-No!

1262
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:42,357
I just had the weirdest feeling
he was already in the house.

1263
01:30:56,927 --> 01:30:58,599
Can't sleep, Miss Graciela?

1264
01:30:59,047 --> 01:31:00,321
Yeah. It's hot.

1265
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:05,476
You know, I think it's the humidity
that makes us all so thirsty.

1266
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:08,839
Excuse me.

1267
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:11,518
My pop was a cop.

1268
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:13,441
Twenty years.

1269
01:31:14,087 --> 01:31:16,555
This was his favorite drink on a stakeout.

1270
01:31:35,127 --> 01:31:37,436
I learned that in prison. You like?

1271
01:31:37,887 --> 01:31:39,605
White trash piece of shit.

1272
01:31:48,527 --> 01:31:49,880
Stay here, Leigh.

1273
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:56,916
Kersek?

1274
01:32:12,007 --> 01:32:14,282
Dani, go back to your room.

1275
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:15,561
Lock the door.

1276
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,806
-Don't go down there, Sam.
-No, it's all right.

1277
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,400
Dani, don't look.

1278
01:32:53,887 --> 01:32:55,843
Oh, my God, Graciela!

1279
01:32:58,967 --> 01:33:00,082
Oh, my God.

1280
01:33:25,407 --> 01:33:26,886
It's the piano wire.

1281
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:34,997
I'm going to get this son of a bitch!

1282
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:44,760
Tell him to stop!

1283
01:33:46,847 --> 01:33:48,724
God, he might be out here!

1284
01:34:28,247 --> 01:34:30,317
Listen, I've got Kersek's gun with me...

1285
01:34:30,407 --> 01:34:33,797
...and you'll find the piano wire
that Cady used in the house.

1286
01:34:33,887 --> 01:34:36,037
Yeah, I know how this looks.

1287
01:34:36,247 --> 01:34:38,556
You're not supposed to flee
a murder scene.

1288
01:34:38,647 --> 01:34:40,842
Listen, Lieutenant.
You may not know this...

1289
01:34:40,927 --> 01:34:43,839
...but in the law there's something
called force majeure.

1290
01:34:43,927 --> 01:34:46,236
It means an unforeseeable act of God...

1291
01:34:46,367 --> 01:34:48,961
...and it cancels all promises
and obligations.

1292
01:34:49,047 --> 01:34:51,356
So, legally speaking, all bets are off.

1293
01:34:51,767 --> 01:34:54,759
You find Max Cady and we'll come back.

1294
01:34:57,287 --> 01:34:59,482
-What did he say?
-He said we're fugitives.

1295
01:34:59,567 --> 01:35:01,956
-What's that mean?
-It means we're doing something right.

1296
01:35:29,047 --> 01:35:31,925
Where's that old mongrel dog of yours,
Mrs. Bowden?

1297
01:37:47,247 --> 01:37:49,203
Tomorrow, I'll catch some fish.

1298
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:53,606
Oh, you know, you don't have to.
I've got enough food to last us a week.

1299
01:38:01,727 --> 01:38:03,080
But it'd be nice.

1300
01:38:04,607 --> 01:38:05,483
Good.

1301
01:38:14,567 --> 01:38:16,637
It's only rain. A sheet of rain.

1302
01:38:20,927 --> 01:38:23,043
-What was that?
-It's just a squall.

1303
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:27,075
-I'll go check the anchor.
-Wait, Dad. Don't go out.

1304
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:29,840
No, Danielle. Everything is okay. All right?

1305
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:33,522
-Yeah. We're on the river now, baby.
-It's just a squall kicking.

1306
01:38:57,567 --> 01:38:59,478
Graciela has a brother.

1307
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:03,522
I mean, she had a brother.

1308
01:39:04,487 --> 01:39:05,602
Oh, sweetie.

1309
01:39:08,127 --> 01:39:10,436
We'll get in touch with him right away.

1310
01:39:13,607 --> 01:39:15,245
We're making some tea.

1311
01:39:25,527 --> 01:39:27,563
I can't hear you. It's windy out.

1312
01:40:07,247 --> 01:40:08,362
What's that?

1313
01:40:08,807 --> 01:40:10,081
Are we moving?

1314
01:40:14,887 --> 01:40:16,206
'Evening, ladies.

1315
01:40:17,727 --> 01:40:19,558
You know my husband has a gun?

1316
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:20,796
Not this gun?

1317
01:40:21,247 --> 01:40:23,363
-Is it this gun?
-Where is he?

1318
01:40:23,447 --> 01:40:25,961
Resting up. He had a long difficult day.

1319
01:40:26,767 --> 01:40:30,999
Danielle, I told you, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

1320
01:40:32,047 --> 01:40:33,162
I didn't.

1321
01:40:34,087 --> 01:40:36,396
-My parents brought me here.
-Of course.

1322
01:40:37,327 --> 01:40:38,521
Where's Sexus?

1323
01:40:39,287 --> 01:40:41,755
-Back at the house.
-Shame.

1324
01:40:42,207 --> 01:40:44,960
I had hoped we could
read aloud from it together.

1325
01:40:46,967 --> 01:40:49,276
Well, l...

1326
01:40:49,767 --> 01:40:52,156
-...memorized some for you.
-Did you?

1327
01:40:52,247 --> 01:40:53,885
-Yeah.
-Did you?

1328
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:58,686
Well, I'm impressed.

1329
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,002
Which part?

1330
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:04,759
The part...

1331
01:41:06,047 --> 01:41:08,038
...you know what part, you know.

1332
01:41:09,327 --> 01:41:12,444
-I don't think you did your homework.
-I did.

1333
01:41:13,407 --> 01:41:14,840
What parts were they?

1334
01:41:17,047 --> 01:41:18,241
The good parts?

1335
01:41:18,727 --> 01:41:20,126
Yeah. They were....

1336
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:22,357
-Were you a good girl?
-I was.

1337
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:24,404
I knew you'd follow me here and...

1338
01:41:24,487 --> 01:41:26,318
You know me pretty well, don't you?

1339
01:41:26,407 --> 01:41:28,477
Yeah. I do.

1340
01:41:28,967 --> 01:41:31,401
You're going to know me a lot better, too.

1341
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:38,837
Are you offering me something hot?

1342
01:41:40,047 --> 01:41:42,436
Let's get something straight here.

1343
01:41:44,367 --> 01:41:48,155
I spent fourteen years
in an eight-by-nine cell...

1344
01:41:48,247 --> 01:41:51,000
...surrounded by people
who were less than human.

1345
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:55,239
My mission in that time was
to become more than human.

1346
01:41:56,847 --> 01:41:57,836
You see?

1347
01:41:59,407 --> 01:42:01,875
Granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church.

1348
01:42:02,207 --> 01:42:03,526
Granny drank strychnine.

1349
01:42:03,607 --> 01:42:06,485
You could say I had a leg-up,
genetically speaking.

1350
01:42:15,007 --> 01:42:17,475
I'm going to forgive you, Danielle, honey.

1351
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:20,481
I know that wasn't the real you,
the true you.

1352
01:42:20,567 --> 01:42:23,001
But I would like you to wait in the hold.

1353
01:42:26,087 --> 01:42:28,237
Danielle, get in the hold.

1354
01:42:31,847 --> 01:42:33,121
-Stop!
-No!

1355
01:42:41,407 --> 01:42:43,557
Ready to be born again, Mrs. Bowden?

1356
01:42:47,527 --> 01:42:51,406
A few minutes alone with me, darling,
and you'll be speaking in tongues.

1357
01:44:07,047 --> 01:44:08,526
Excuse me, Mrs. B.

1358
01:44:08,847 --> 01:44:10,360
Please don't take umbrage...

1359
01:44:10,447 --> 01:44:12,961
...but in the plan that I have formulated...

1360
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:16,558
...there's much more to it
than just you and I making love.

1361
01:44:16,647 --> 01:44:18,603
I mean, that's just so...

1362
01:44:19,367 --> 01:44:21,085
...commonplace and dreary.

1363
01:44:22,887 --> 01:44:24,843
Here and now, we have an opportunity.

1364
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:26,918
"What is that opportunity?" you ask.

1365
01:44:27,007 --> 01:44:29,441
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity...

1366
01:44:29,527 --> 01:44:32,439
...to depict and dramatize...

1367
01:44:35,207 --> 01:44:37,437
...both the heights and the depths...

1368
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:42,003
...of a mama's true love of her daughter,
if you get my meaning.

1369
01:44:42,087 --> 01:44:44,681
Come on out, babe.
Come on, darling. Let's go.

1370
01:44:44,807 --> 01:44:47,401
Get out. Get up here.

1371
01:44:47,767 --> 01:44:50,600
This is between you and me.
Leave them out of it.

1372
01:44:50,687 --> 01:44:54,475
This is my night, Counselor.
Don't you step on my lines.

1373
01:44:55,927 --> 01:44:56,757
Stop!

1374
01:44:58,967 --> 01:45:00,082
Yes, Leigh?

1375
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:02,877
Listen to me, Max.

1376
01:45:06,087 --> 01:45:08,965
You know, Max, since all this started...

1377
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:11,123
...I've thought about you all the time.

1378
01:45:11,207 --> 01:45:16,076
I've tried to imagine
what it must have been like for you...

1379
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:18,597
...all those years, locked up in jail.

1380
01:45:18,687 --> 01:45:23,636
I've tried to imagine you
and even your crimes...

1381
01:45:23,807 --> 01:45:27,322
...and how you must have felt
in those moments that you did them.

1382
01:45:27,967 --> 01:45:31,482
See, I know about loss, Max.

1383
01:45:31,567 --> 01:45:36,004
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1384
01:45:36,887 --> 01:45:40,766
And I know it doesn't compare to jail, but...

1385
01:45:41,647 --> 01:45:43,319
...l can understand...

1386
01:45:43,767 --> 01:45:45,883
...and I could share this with you.

1387
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:50,603
Because of that whatever it is
that you've got planned...

1388
01:45:50,887 --> 01:45:53,117
...l want you to do it just with me...

1389
01:45:54,607 --> 01:45:56,086
...not with her...

1390
01:45:56,887 --> 01:45:58,081
...because...

1391
01:45:59,967 --> 01:46:01,844
...we have this connection.

1392
01:46:12,887 --> 01:46:14,798
What do you think, Counselor?

1393
01:46:20,087 --> 01:46:21,998
That was real eloquent, Leigh.

1394
01:46:24,207 --> 01:46:25,481
Brave, too.

1395
01:46:26,047 --> 01:46:29,835
I want to thank you for conveying to me
your most powerful emotions...

1396
01:46:30,887 --> 01:46:31,956
...because...

1397
01:46:37,567 --> 01:46:39,762
...I'm going to enjoy this all the more.

1398
01:46:49,447 --> 01:46:50,562
Oh, my God!

1399
01:47:45,887 --> 01:47:49,084
The people call Samuel J. Bowden!

1400
01:47:52,607 --> 01:47:55,724
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1401
01:47:55,807 --> 01:47:58,685
-Somebody's got to man the boat.
-Did you swear?

1402
01:47:58,807 --> 01:48:00,240
-I'll do it.
-Sit, Danielle.

1403
01:48:00,327 --> 01:48:03,285
Don't make light of your civic duty.
You're the jury.

1404
01:48:04,407 --> 01:48:07,399
All right, I swear to tell the truth.
What do you want to know?

1405
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:11,321
Was a prior sexual history ever prepared
in connection with my defense?

1406
01:48:15,647 --> 01:48:16,602
It's....

1407
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,676
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
That was argumentative.

1408
01:48:20,767 --> 01:48:24,476
An investigator did prepare a prior
sexual history on the alleged victim...

1409
01:48:24,567 --> 01:48:25,716
...true?

1410
01:48:25,807 --> 01:48:29,243
I can ask leading questions, Your Honor.
He is a hostile witness.

1411
01:48:29,327 --> 01:48:32,956
Would you care to tell the court
what the gist was of this report?

1412
01:48:33,047 --> 01:48:35,515
It was fourteen years ago.
I can't remember that.

1413
01:48:36,407 --> 01:48:38,841
How can he answer
when you're hitting him?

1414
01:48:39,527 --> 01:48:42,837
Because he's perjuring himself.
He knows damn well what it said.

1415
01:48:42,927 --> 01:48:45,646
-Don't you?
-It said that she was promiscuous.

1416
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,958
It said she had three different lovers
in one month.

1417
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:52,364
At least three! And did you show
this report to the D.A.?

1418
01:48:56,687 --> 01:49:00,999
I found it when I started representing
myself six years into my sentence!

1419
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,998
But there it was in the court file.

1420
01:49:03,087 --> 01:49:05,476
Back in '77, you buried it, Counselor.

1421
01:49:05,567 --> 01:49:08,127
Would you care to tell the jury why?

1422
01:49:09,687 --> 01:49:11,962
Would you care to tell the court why?

1423
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:16,886
Because I know he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

1424
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,923
Talk to me! I'm standing here!

1425
01:49:19,807 --> 01:49:22,799
Just because she was promiscuous
doesn't justify you raping her!

1426
01:49:22,887 --> 01:49:26,436
You bragged that you beat two prior
aggravated rapes. You were a menace!

1427
01:49:26,527 --> 01:49:28,006
You were my lawyer!

1428
01:49:29,567 --> 01:49:32,240
That report could have saved me
fourteen years.

1429
01:49:32,327 --> 01:49:35,080
-You're probably right.
-You self-righteous fuck!

1430
01:49:39,767 --> 01:49:42,964
I'm Virgil and I'm guiding you
through the gates of Hell.

1431
01:49:43,047 --> 01:49:46,437
We are now in the 9th circle,
the circle of traitors.

1432
01:49:46,887 --> 01:49:49,845
Traitors to country,
traitors to fellow man...

1433
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,919
...traitors to God!

1434
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:56,240
You, sir, are charged with
betraying the principles of all three!

1435
01:49:56,647 --> 01:49:58,922
Can you please quote for me the A.B.A.'s...

1436
01:49:59,007 --> 01:50:01,601
...Rules of Professional Conduct, Canon 7?

1437
01:50:03,047 --> 01:50:05,242
"A lawyer should represent his client..."

1438
01:50:05,327 --> 01:50:08,797
"Should zealously represent his client
within the bounds of the law."

1439
01:50:08,887 --> 01:50:11,560
And I find you guilty, Counselor...

1440
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:13,842
...guilty of betraying your fellow man...

1441
01:50:13,927 --> 01:50:15,838
...guilty of betraying your country...

1442
01:50:15,927 --> 01:50:17,997
...guilty of abrogating your oath...

1443
01:50:18,087 --> 01:50:20,601
...guilty of judging me and selling me out!

1444
01:50:20,887 --> 01:50:24,118
And with the power vested in me
by the kingdom of God...

1445
01:50:24,447 --> 01:50:28,565
...l sentence you to the 9th circle of Hell!

1446
01:50:28,647 --> 01:50:31,286
Now you will learn about loss...

1447
01:50:31,527 --> 01:50:35,122
...loss of freedom, loss of humanity.

1448
01:50:35,607 --> 01:50:39,316
Now you and I will truly
be the same, Counselor.

1449
01:50:39,487 --> 01:50:41,523
Danielle, get down on your knees.

1450
01:50:41,607 --> 01:50:42,756
Take off your clothes!

1451
01:50:42,847 --> 01:50:44,485
Down on your knees now!

1452
01:50:46,887 --> 01:50:49,481
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!

1453
01:50:52,327 --> 01:50:53,919
Don't!

1454
01:50:56,327 --> 01:50:59,524
Now, off with your clothes!

1455
01:50:59,687 --> 01:51:04,078
You, Leigh, take off your clothes. Now!

1456
01:51:05,847 --> 01:51:08,236
Come on!

1457
01:51:09,847 --> 01:51:11,678
Tonight, you'll learn to be an animal...

1458
01:51:11,767 --> 01:51:14,361
...to live like an animal and to die like one.

1459
01:51:17,847 --> 01:51:19,405
Give me your hand!

1460
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,396
Go!

1461
01:54:13,087 --> 01:54:15,999
Did you forget about that
restraining order, Counselor?

1462
01:54:16,087 --> 01:54:18,317
You're well within 500 yards!

1463
01:54:25,047 --> 01:54:26,844
Well, here we are, Counselor...

1464
01:54:26,927 --> 01:54:28,485
...just two lawyers...

1465
01:54:28,647 --> 01:54:30,046
...working it out!

1466
01:54:43,327 --> 01:54:44,999
I'm going to kill you!

1467
01:54:45,167 --> 01:54:47,965
You already sacrificed me, Counselor.

1468
01:55:31,807 --> 01:55:34,605
"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand

1469
01:55:34,807 --> 01:55:36,923
"Oh who will come and go with me

1470
01:55:37,567 --> 01:55:40,798
"I am bound for the promised land"

1471
01:57:37,927 --> 01:57:40,157
We never spoke about what happened...

1472
01:57:40,527 --> 01:57:42,438
...at least not to each other.

1473
01:57:43,487 --> 01:57:45,318
Fear, I suppose...

1474
01:57:45,967 --> 01:57:48,959
...that to remember his name
or what he did...

1475
01:57:49,327 --> 01:57:51,795
...would mean letting him into our dreams.

1476
01:57:52,727 --> 01:57:55,924
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

1477
01:57:57,767 --> 01:58:01,077
Still, things won't ever be
the way they were before he came.

1478
01:58:01,767 --> 01:58:03,405
But that's all right...

1479
01:58:03,687 --> 01:58:07,475
...because if you hang onto the past,
you die a little every day.

1480
01:58:08,327 --> 01:58:09,680
And for myself...

1481
01:58:10,367 --> 01:58:12,085
...l know I'd rather live.

1482
01:58:13,247 --> 01:58:14,123
