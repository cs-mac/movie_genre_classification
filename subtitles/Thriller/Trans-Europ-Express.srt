We are at
an evolutionary moment.

13
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,391
One that pushes us
to confront

14
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,399
how we define ourselves
and know one another.

15
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:37,898
We've outgrown categories

16
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,767
and definitions
that once held us.

17
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:43,363
Man, woman, boy, girl.

18
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:47,692
Masculine and feminine
no longer reflect us all.

19
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:49,435
We've made way
for something new:

20
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:53,158
cis and trans, non-binary
and gender queer.

21
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,761
The singular "they."

22
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,060
We've seen
an Olympian sprint away

23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,359
from her heroic past
to declare herself anew.

24
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,729
A black child
from Mobile, Alabama, reach

25
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,254
unimaginable stardom
on our screens.

26
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,088
An Army sergeant break rank

27
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:17,030
to defend his right to serve
our country openly.

28
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:20,823
These stories of triumph
do not outweigh the tragedy

29
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:23,051
facing many Trans-Americans

30
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,985
who struggle
with limited access

31
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:29,187
to shelter, healthcare,
education, and employment.

32
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:31,187
Susceptible to HIV,

33
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:35,126
criminalization,
suicide, and violence.

34
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:42,252
Despite the vitriol,
despite the backlash,

35
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:46,351
despite the discriminatory laws,
we fight to be seen

36
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:51,920
as we see ourselves and live
our truth without compromise.

37
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:56,076
We are a constellation

38
00:02:56,082 --> 00:03:00,681
of experiences,
expressions, and identities.

39
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,250
Ours is a mesmerizing
constellation,

40
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,817
so vast, it can't be contained,

41
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,243
so plentiful,
it can't be denied

42
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:11,716
so brilliant, it shines
through the dark.

43
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:14,871
This is "The Trans List."

44
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,613
I grew up

45
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,239
in a very rural community,

46
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,542
which really still
is close to my heart,

47
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,212
in the middle of Missouri,
called Fayette, Missouri.

48
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,568
Population hee-haw.

49
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:38,244
One flashing red light
in the middle of town.

50
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,870
We're called "the buckle
of the Bible Belt."

51
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:46,012
I remember coming home
every day after school

52
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,336
and having private time
with myself praying.

53
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:52,108
I prayed for unity
of my body, mind, and spirit.

54
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:55,764
Now obviously, I didn't have
those exact words as a child,

55
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,610
but I knew
that my body and--

56
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,632
and my mind didn't conform.

57
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:03,236
I wanted God to
change me, to fix me,

58
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,005
because I knew
something was wrong.

59
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:10,601
I was masculine.
Always masculine.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,030
Uber-macsuline.

61
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:16,263
I was never mistaken
as a girl most times,

62
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,267
and if I dressed up
as a girl,

63
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,436
it looked like
I was in drag.

64
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:23,702
Well, I would try
to pretend to be a girl,

65
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,257
and that would last for,
like, two days at school,

66
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,805
and I just
couldn't stand it.

67
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,296
I'm like,
"This seems so... gay."

68
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:36,255
My parents were
children of slaves.

69
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,829
They loved me unconditionally,

70
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,428
no matter who I was or am.

71
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:45,158
My father drove trucks.

72
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,400
I'd go on runs with him
on my spring break,

73
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:49,594
when I could be
with him all week.

74
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,852
People would always say,
"Oh, you brought
your son with you."

75
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,399
He just never blinked an eye
and kept it moving.

76
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,892
Well, he was just
always my cover guy.

77
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:02,094
He just innately got
who I was.

78
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:07,223
A child that looked like me
going to school had

79
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,353
a very hard time
with the skin color.

80
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:13,356
I'd lived as a high yellow

81
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,655
and had taken a lot of hate
from that as a child.

82
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,854
I got locked
in the coat closet

83
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,193
by the teacher
for doing nothing,

84
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,317
and luckily,
my dad did truck deliveries

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,650
and happened to walk
into the school one day

86
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,592
and saw
what was happening.

87
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,215
He dropped a delivery

88
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,418
and walked
to the principal's face,

89
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:36,188
and he said,
"Don't you ever do that
to my child again."

90
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,544
I think Mother had more designs

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,619
on who I should be
and what I should
be looking like.

92
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,286
I turned 18,

93
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:49,382
my mother put
her hand on my shoulder
and looked me in the eye.

94
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,512
She's like,
"You know you're a girl, right?"

95
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,884
I described myself
as nothing, literally,

96
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,841
and would just,
like, avoid the question.

97
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:58,416
Then finally,
I began to use the "L" word.

98
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:01,383
It was like,
"Uh, l-- l--"

99
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,339
Because my attraction
was towards women,

100
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:05,786
I must be a lesbian.

101
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:08,907
But I was never at home
in any of the spaces.

102
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,781
You listen to certain music,
you read certain books.

103
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,806
I'm like, "Well, gee,
this music isn't for me."

104
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,610
For a black person
walking around

105
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,639
looking like a dude going,
"Hey, man. What's going on?

106
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,912
How you doin', man?"
Uh, they just didn't
like that very much.

107
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,204
It wasn't until
I found an article

108
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,907
about Billy Tipton,
who was a musician.

109
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,733
He hadn't sought
medical treatment

110
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:33,909
and he died of simply

111
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,106
a-- a bleeding ulcer

112
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:40,105
because he'd been hiding
his identity for so long.

113
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:43,274
I'd hide that in our house
every day to read after school,

114
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,471
and it let me know
I wasn't crazy.

115
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,373
I would always
play Perry Mason

116
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,100
on my little twin bed.

117
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,833
In my room
was my desk

118
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,775
and I'd have
everything laid out.

119
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,769
What I had decided was

120
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,997
that I would become
a corporate lawyer.

121
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,901
It was horrifying.

122
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,770
Skirt suits, hose, and heels.

123
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,366
I couldn't wait to
get to the parking lot

124
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,397
to get in my car.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,699
I was like Superman.

126
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,099
As soon as I got in the car,
I was ripping everything off.

127
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,328
And I started
dressing like this.

128
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:16,572
It's just innately me.

129
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,397
I had had a vision

130
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:24,096
that one day I would do
testimony before Congress,

131
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:25,996
and I remember
thinking that as a kid

132
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:28,496
playing Perry Mason
on my little bed.

133
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:31,095
And then that happened.

134
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,724
It was very emotional.

135
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,427
It took me back
to the experiences

136
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:38,298
that I had had
of being treated

137
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,863
as a non-human being
just for being trans.

138
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,460
But I wanted to tell

139
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,059
everybody's story
through my story.

140
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,988
We need clear,
explicit protection

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,661
for trans people
throughout this country

142
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:55,056
so there is no doubt
that somebody can't kill me

143
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,787
just because I'm trans.

144
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,589
And if they do,
then they suffer
the consequence.

145
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:12,854
Today it's not
such a big deal.

146
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:17,153
25, 30 years ago,
it was a big deal.

147
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,852
Getting through
the '60s and '70s transgender,

148
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,852
it wasn't-- wasn't fun.

149
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:27,581
Back then,
you just blended in.

150
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:30,113
Is there a certain way that
you're supposed to be or look?

151
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:34,586
We come in all
shapes and sizes.

152
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,552
God blessed me
with my looks

153
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:37,848
to be able to work
as a model,

154
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,209
but it's also--

155
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,085
that's caused me
the greatest deal of problems.

156
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:46,907
I think it would have
gone to my grave.

157
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,313
I don't think
I would have ever been

158
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:52,183
open enough
to say, you know,

159
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,979
"This is me. So what?"

160
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:58,178
It was just forced upon me
and then having to deal with it.

161
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,277
After I was outed
by "News of the World,"

162
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:06,476
I felt desperate, suicidal.

163
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,976
It really wasn't
anyone's business,

164
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,106
and it should have
been left to me

165
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:10,878
if I wanted to talk about it.

166
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,675
I had all these tabloids

167
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,674
ringing and-- and saying,
"You know, just--

168
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,304
"let-- let's see
your birth certificate.

169
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,548
Let's see some documentation."

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,640
I was devastated.

171
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,369
I mean, it was
very personal to me

172
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:23,603
and private.

173
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:27,905
I thank the Lord
that I did have my family.

174
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:31,544
That just gave me
strength to fight.

175
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:36,236
The rights and recognition
and, um, to be accepted.

176
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,165
It wasn't until
I had sexual awareness

177
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,298
that I realized, you know,
"There's something
wrong with me."

178
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,072
I just assumed
I must be gay,

179
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,897
because I was attracted
to boys and not girls.

180
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,870
I just needed
to get away from home
and find myself.

181
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,496
Grow my hair...

182
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,569
tid a bit and look
sort of girly.

183
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,965
I moved to London
and I wasn't accepted

184
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,665
in gay clubs,
in the gay circles.

185
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,494
They said, "Oh, you know,
we don't allow drag queens."

186
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,337
And it's like,
"Drag queens?

187
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,891
I-- I'm not a drag queen."

188
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,566
I was totally lost.

189
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,289
I had an evening job
in a West End show

190
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,696
selling programs,
ice creams.

191
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:22,334
Quite a famous choreographer
came up to me and said,

192
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,158
"Have you ever thought
about being a showgirl?"

193
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,391
and I said,
"Showgirl?"

194
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,864
And he said,
"Well, you're beautiful.
You're tall. You're slim."

195
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,430
I said,
"Well, um, I'm a boy."

196
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:34,456
And he said,
"Well, I know that,
but in Paris,

197
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,489
"lots of the beautiful showgirls

198
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:39,461
are all transgender
and what have you."

199
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,028
And he said, "I'm auditioning
and I'd like you to come along."

200
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,924
And I was like, "Okay."

201
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,984
So, I went along
for the audition

202
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,129
and got the job
and it was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

203
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:50,483
And it changed my life.

204
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,525
I was working in Paris.

205
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,021
This one particular person

206
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,782
kept sending champagne

207
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,157
and I met him
after the show

208
00:10:58,154 --> 00:10:59,884
and he was very handsome.

209
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,826
I confided
and, uh, he--

210
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,520
he thought it was fascinating.

211
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,419
He said, "You're beautiful,
you're unusual,

212
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,879
"you should never have surgery.

213
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,785
You're unique."

214
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,255
He gave me
a beautiful penthouse,

215
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:15,921
jewelry, clothes, love.

216
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,278
I had everything

217
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,384
a girl would look for
in a relationship.

218
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:21,754
But I just--
I weren't happy.

219
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,276
Without getting
into the nitty-gritty

220
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,883
of the sexual side of things,

221
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:28,581
I mean, he never
touched me down there.

222
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,921
Obviously he was aware of it
'cause he could see it.

223
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,815
It wasn't something
I was comfortable with.

224
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:34,414
Um, you know, it was

225
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,574
just a part of my body
that I detested.

226
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,549
I couldn't be active.
I wanted to be passive.

227
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,976
I tried being passive

228
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,678
as the gay role, but... 

229
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,818
that just wasn't
comfortable for me.

230
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,641
He said, "Well, you know,
I'll give you the world,

231
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,144
but I'm not gonna pay
for your surgery."

232
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,714
I said,
"Well, that's okay."

233
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,739
You know, so, um,
I made my way home.

234
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,575
I've never
regretted my surgery.

235
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,875
It was important for me.

236
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,074
I do know
and have heard of people

237
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:05,874
where, "It's gonna
make me a woman."

238
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:06,974
You know, "I can't wait."

239
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:10,113
And it's like no,
it'll help you function,

240
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:12,267
but it's never gonna
make you a complete woman.

241
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:16,073
That's just a small part
of the whole picture.

242
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,912
And I did the Wella ad
for a perm,

243
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,835
and that was a big campaign.

244
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,808
Bras for Playtex.

245
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:29,570
I'd also been part
of the Smirnoff Vodka campaign.

246
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,309
I was behind the Loch Ness
Monster, waterskiing.

247
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:35,002
And it was a great campaign.

248
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,802
It was all in--
all the magazines

249
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,002
and billboards.

250
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:39,532
And nobody knew.

251
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:44,004
It just--
it wasn't questioned.

252
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:48,960
But everything crashed down
with the Bond film.

253
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,332
I can honestly say that

254
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:55,261
I loved being successful
as a model full-stop,

255
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:58,265
not transsexual
Tula the model.

256
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:03,203
There's a lot of bigoted,
ignorant people out there

257
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,596
that still give people
like myself a hard time.

258
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:08,025
Odd character that say,
"No matter what you do,

259
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,258
you'll always be
a mutilated man."

260
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:13,232
Very unfair
because we're not criminals.

261
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,498
You know,
we were born this way

262
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,453
and we just really try
to make the most of life.

263
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,160
I just...

264
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:21,030
pray for them.

265
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,796
It's all I can say,
because they have

266
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,123
more problems
than I do.

267
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:27,295
I'm just me
and I hate labels

268
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,022
and boxes, so...

269
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:37,293
As a kid,

270
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,989
I loved boy bands,
and I still do.

271
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,689
I also loved Pee-wee Herman.

272
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,048
I loved "Pee-wee's Playhouse."

273
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,324
His gender was
so strange to me.

274
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,691
He was so otherworldly.

275
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,146
I also loved
the movie "Stand by Me."

276
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,154
Watched it obsessively.

277
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:55,554
Had it memorized
by seven.

278
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,819
It felt like
a raw connection.

279
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:02,948
Four young male friends
in the '50s--

280
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,521
there was something there.

281
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,147
An experience
that I was longing for.

282
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,320
I remember walking
outside with my mother

283
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,615
at the age of five
and telling her

284
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,115
I should have been
born a boy.

285
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,785
It was a very
simple conversation.

286
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,041
Like, "No, you don't.
Don't say that again."

287
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,817
And then I don't think
I did say that again

288
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:24,984
for a long time.

289
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,610
I had long brown hair

290
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:31,243
and bangs, and it was
always pulled back.

291
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,746
I feel like I look the same.

292
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:34,545
Honestly.

293
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,415
With a few minor adjustments.

294
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,080
Shopping for clothes was always
a nightmare growing up.

295
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:44,037
The girls' section of Kmart,
that's where I would--

296
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,413
you know,
those were my options,

297
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,010
so it was, like,
the most masculine stuff

298
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,109
that I could find
in those sections.

299
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,809
Clothing was the one thing
where I felt like

300
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,008
I had some control over
how the world was seeing me.

301
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,778
Well, anything that
would hide my body--

302
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,674
large, giant pieces
of clothing.

303
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,233
I-- I really loved

304
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:04,280
any kind of, like,
oversized, hooded sweatshirts.

305
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,532
I didn't want anybody
to see... anything,

306
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,278
so I covered it up.

307
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,174
I really don't know
what I was waiting for

308
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:18,400
for so long.

309
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:20,573
It just felt it was
no longer an option

310
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,629
for my sanity
or for my health.

311
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:24,835
I was trying to make it through
without transitioning,

312
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:25,875
and I couldn't.

313
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:29,298
I had to stop
spending so much time

314
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,371
covering up my emotions
and my problems,

315
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:33,697
and I had to deal
with myself.

316
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,896
My drinking was

317
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,469
a coping mechanism...
to not deal with gender,

318
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:44,994
to not deal with the way
that I was existing

319
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,198
in the world
at the time.

320
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:47,528
And I know that
if I had kept drinking,

321
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,000
I never would have
done anything.

322
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,067
I had started
taking photographs

323
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,263
of trans men
in San Francisco.

324
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:56,723
I met my friend, Rocco.

325
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:58,568
During his photoshoot,
I was telling him

326
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,221
I wanted to make
all of these photographs

327
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,999
and just put them
into a zine.

328
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,694
And we ended up
partnering up

329
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:06,764
and making it into,
this quarterly-printed magazine.

330
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,496
There wasn't
really much trans
experiences

331
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:10,693
in the media
at all.

332
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,823
I wanted to see
myself reflected,

333
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,265
and from there it grew.

334
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,989
The models
and the people
being featured

335
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,121
were speaking
for themselves
as trans people.

336
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,595
They weren't just
being photographed
and put in a magazine,

337
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,791
they weren't just having
an article written about them.

338
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,060
They were talking,

339
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,287
they were telling us
their story,

340
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,020
posing the way
that they wanted to pose.

341
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,762
They were-- everything was
very much like, you know,

342
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:33,216
self-styled,
and... that--

343
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,722
I felt like
needed to happen.

344
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,991
Naming it "Original Plumbing"

345
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,918
was like throwing it
in people's faces

346
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,020
who are always asking, you know,
"What's in your pants?"

347
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,520
Finding out that you're trans

348
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,059
and just immediately
thinking about genitals.

349
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,783
It's just acknowledging

350
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,585
that that's a question
that's asked constantly

351
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:56,211
Passing is when
you're not being

352
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,158
"seen" as a trans person.

353
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,780
I think I noticed
that I was really,

354
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:03,753
um, "passing" when,
um, men would

355
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,109
say things if I made
eye contact for too long.

356
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:09,086
I remember smiling at
a young man and his young son,

357
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,551
they were on a bicycle,
and just, like, smiling at them,

358
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:14,407
and he was like,
"What the fuck are
you looking at? Fucking faggot."

359
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:18,676
I just would love
to tell my younger self

360
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,649
that there are more experiences
than just male and female.

361
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:24,182
You will be an adult.

362
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,178
You will not be shopping
in the women's section of Kmart.

363
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,578
You will become yourself.

364
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:42,205
The very first time

365
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,309
that I dressed up,

366
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,308
it was one of the greatest

367
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:49,078
moments of my life.

368
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,043
I felt enlightened.

369
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,600
I just felt... me.

370
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:59,905
It was a white dress,
strapless, and short to my--

371
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:02,174
down to my knees
and it was flare.

372
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,741
I would say
I felt like Cinderella.

373
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:08,967
The little mousies came
and just gave me the magic wand,

374
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,440
and I was just transform.

375
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:16,772
I am a very proud
Trans-Latina immigrant.

376
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,268
Some people may think

377
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,798
that I'm a troublemaker,

378
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,400
but our time is now.

379
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,670
Our time to resist,
our time to organize,

380
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,996
it's now.

381
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,269
Oftentimes, the LGB community

382
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,165
is not supportive of the issues
happening with us.

383
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:36,431
Where the trans community
is in comparison

384
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:39,890
to the LGB community,

385
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,566
we are about 40 years behind--

386
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,393
legislatively, economically,

387
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:47,465
academically, you name it.

388
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:53,264
There was a very significant
event that changed my life.

389
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,031
The murder of Gwen Araujo.

390
00:18:57,294 --> 00:19:00,064
That sparked my anger.

391
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,429
That unleashed the deer in me.

392
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,455
Ever since then,
I've been, like, nonstop,

393
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,788
doing whatever I need to
in order to not only make

394
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,231
the voices of my community heard

395
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,224
but disrupting whoever.

396
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,523
And when I came
to Los Angeles,

397
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:22,521
I found my community here.

398
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,881
1988.

399
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:29,157
There were a gang of girls,
20, 30, in one corner.

400
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:32,554
Those who have
a little more experience

401
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,223
or that were
a little more seasoned

402
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,120
would take us
under their wing.

403
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,779
How to do my makeup,

404
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,655
how to do a body.

405
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,181
They give you tips and tricks.

406
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:45,055
I needed to go

407
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,081
every single night
to the street

408
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,984
to get money.

409
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,823
That was my only
source of money.

410
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,076
Drugs were my refuge.

411
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,083
Drugs was a way
for me to cope

412
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,452
with everything that was
going on in my life.

413
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,718
Sleeping on the street,

414
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,275
coping with the fact
that I had just been raped.

415
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,221
Drugs did that.

416
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:08,843
Gave me the strength
to continue to survive.

417
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,342
There were major crimes
that I committed.

418
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,515
The crimes that I committed

419
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:17,771
were generated
because of my drug addiction.

420
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:23,147
I was in a prison
of about 3,000 men.

421
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,013
There was this individual who,

422
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,370
every time
he would see me,

423
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:29,075
he would say,
"You need to stop it.
You need to stop it."

424
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:32,316
He came with a big two-by-four.

425
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,538
Out of nowhere,
he just started hitting me.

426
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,041
I ended up
in the infirmary.

427
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,640
But then after,
when I got out,

428
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,670
I seen him and...

429
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:46,842
I did what I needed to do.

430
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,935
One of the proudest moments

431
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,767
that I continue to feel
is when I see

432
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,610
the transformation
of a young person.

433
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:01,436
Seeing them build up.

434
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:04,635
Seeing them
transform themselves.

435
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:08,035
I felt like a--
like a proud mama.

436
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,008
I think I need a moment.

437
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:27,205
I always refer to myself

438
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,758
as "Yo soy un milagro,"

439
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:33,263
which means that
I am a miracle.

440
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:37,555
There was a reason
why I didn't...

441
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,162
get killed
when I was
on the streets.

442
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,662
There was a reason why

443
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:45,330
when I overdosed
in an alley,

444
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:47,997
the paramedics came
and got me.

445
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:49,554
There was a reason

446
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,759
why I didn't get killed
when I was in prison.

447
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,552
I'm supposed to be here

448
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,128
doing what...

449
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,194
I'm supposed to be doing.

450
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:21,687
Testosterone is a powerful hormone.

451
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,189
It changed
the way I think,

452
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:29,016
it changed the way
I interact in the world,

453
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:30,589
it gave me confidence,

454
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:34,314
and it also gave me confidence
around my sexuality.

455
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,117
Loving your own body
can change your life.

456
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:42,616
I decided I'm gonna make
my own idea of what a man is,

457
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,046
and for me,
my idea of a man

458
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,890
doesn't necessarily
include a penis.

459
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,212
So I'm a man without a penis.

460
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,515
What does that say
to the world?

461
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:51,345
It says that you can be any type
of man that you want to be.

462
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:55,781
My ideal man was G.I. Joe.

463
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:57,810
Since I was a kid,
G.I. Joe was

464
00:22:57,813 --> 00:22:59,413
this guy that
I wanted to be.

465
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:01,483
I wanted to have
that masculine body

466
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,838
and I wanted
to have muscles

467
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,245
and I wanted to take
my shirt off.

468
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:07,515
And I know it just seems
very... shallow in a sense,

469
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,241
but I think
for trans people,

470
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,815
our outer selves are
very important to us.

471
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:14,840
They're very important to
the way we present to the world

472
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:17,043
because it's the way
the world comes back to us.

473
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:21,409
My first suicide attempt
was at 16.

474
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:24,141
There was no future.

475
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:27,581
All I thought about
was killing myself.

476
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,203
That was the only option
I ever felt that I had.

477
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:35,036
It is that thing that
in a way kept me going.

478
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,008
I always knew that I had
this "option," right?

479
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:41,605
This option to just check out.

480
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,631
I started going to therapy.

481
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,437
None of my therapists
had the tools, right?

482
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:48,606
In the '80s and '90s,

483
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:51,833
nobody really talked
about a transgender man.

484
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,775
When I said I felt
like a man, they all said,

485
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,699
"Well, you're a very
male-identified female,"

486
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,031
which still, to this day,
I don't really understand.

487
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:02,505
"Basically, you're a lesbian
and just deal with it."

488
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,900
But I knew that wasn't true.

489
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,729
Eventually, one day I found
this amazing therapist.

490
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:10,602
And she would say,
"Whenever you're ready

491
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,129
to say something,
it's okay, I'm here."

492
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,902
She knew I needed
to say something,

493
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:17,298
and every week, I would just
sit there for 45 minutes,

494
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,727
'til one day I walked in,
I just started crying,

495
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,330
and I said,
"I feel like a man."

496
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,429
And she said,
"I believe you.

497
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,069
I believe you.
What can we do?"

498
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,192
She saved my life.

499
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:33,225
There was
no Internet back then,

500
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,868
which is, like, such
a crazy thing to say now.

501
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:37,921
There's no cell phones
or Internet, right?

502
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,166
There was no Internet,

503
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,490
and I had to go to bookstores.

504
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:45,222
I found like a very homemade,
punk rock, stapled-together book

505
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:46,396
that I still have.

506
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,362
Resource guide

507
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:51,787
for male-to-female
transsexuals.

508
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,491
I knew that was me,
but the opposite.

509
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,760
And in that,
I found a hormone doctor.

510
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:58,687
He never dealt
with a person like me.

511
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,219
He only dealt with
male-to-female transsexuals,

512
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:04,462
but he knew when he heard
the urgency in my voice.

513
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:07,854
He said actually these words:
"You will be my guinea pig,

514
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:09,914
"because I have no idea
what I'm doing.

515
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Are you prepared for that?"

516
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,490
And I was prepared for it.

517
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,116
I didn't have a choice.

518
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:19,615
When I decided to get
into making pornography,

519
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,518
they had chicks with dicks,

520
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,858
and I was like,
"That's interesting.

521
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:25,851
I could be the man
with a pussy."

522
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:30,510
It didn't exist in the whole
pornography world.

523
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:31,986
Who's gonna be my audience?

524
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:34,183
Who's gonna be the people
who are gonna be my customers?

525
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,852
Who? Who? Who knows?

526
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:38,679
Surprisingly so,
it was gay men.

527
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:43,151
I got emails that said,
"I've always fantasized,

528
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:45,747
always fantasized,
about a man with a vagina."

529
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:47,177
I was like,
"What?"

530
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,749
Nobody acknowledged
my work in my industry.

531
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:54,006
Nobody acknowledged my work,
and then all of a sudden

532
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:57,512
I won the "Oscar"
of the porn business.

533
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:01,651
What I learned from my work

534
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:05,673
and what I really believe
about sexuality and desire

535
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:08,276
is that it is
a human thing.

536
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,206
People are attracted to people.

537
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,779
I've pretty much had sex
with pretty much every type

538
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,545
of human being there is.

539
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,670
And it's because I was
attracted to them as a person.

540
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,973
Becoming connected
to your sexuality

541
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:24,243
and your body sexually
is a huge part

542
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,899
of becoming yourself

543
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:27,875
and understanding
and loving your body.

544
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,172
It changes everything.

545
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:44,936
It's difficult.

546
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:49,064
Because my life did get better

547
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:52,397
and I feel so blessed
in so many ways,

548
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
but when I look back
and I see that little--

549
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,539
I see that little kid, and I...

550
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,365
and I know how
that little kid feels,

551
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:07,664
and I know how
that little kid doesn't see

552
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:09,694
the light at the end
of the tunnel.

553
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,896
And I know you can
say it to that kid.

554
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,966
I could say it
to him right now.

555
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:15,493
There is a light.

556
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,065
There is a light,
believe me.

557
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:20,662
But I know
how deep it hurts.

558
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:24,461
But what I could say
to that... kid is,

559
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:27,330
"You can be G.I. Joe. You can."

560
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,955
Miss Major:
I don't need your acceptance.

561
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,557
I just need your respect.

562
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:48,026
Read your Bible,
go back to the Pharaoh,

563
00:27:48,023 --> 00:27:51,423
and pick any eunuch
that you can think of,

564
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,481
see if it had a first name,
which was probably Bob,

565
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:56,828
and what they
call it now, Loretta.

566
00:27:58,454 --> 00:28:00,624
Oh, that's a transgender person.

567
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:01,951
Well, shit. Oh, dear.

568
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:04,023
We've been around
since time began.

569
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,950
Duh.

570
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,078
The '60s were a moment
of everybody trying

571
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:14,055
to self-identify, everybody
trying to be who they are

572
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,921
and get recognized
for that and appreciated.

573
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:20,277
My family told me that...

574
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:23,382
Chicago was not big enough
for the both of us.

575
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,982
Went to New York and got
my world turned upside down.

576
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:29,022
It was vibrant and young,

577
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:30,675
and people were
dressing up to go out,

578
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:32,851
and the clubs were sparkling

579
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:35,417
and everybody was
doing their own thing.

580
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,413
No matter what you were into,

581
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:40,042
you could find it there
at any time.

582
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:44,315
It was absolutely fabulous.

583
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:47,041
Stonewall was
a meeting place

584
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:49,114
in the Village
in New York

585
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,511
for transgender,
nonconforming people

586
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,369
to meet and socialize
and hang out.

587
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:58,176
When you were through
hookin', you know,

588
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,746
you could run in
and have a quick drink

589
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,842
before you went home,
chat with your friends,

590
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,772
see who made
the most amount of money,

591
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,244
make plans
for the next day,

592
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,211
and then hit it.

593
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,173
You had to step away

594
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,344
from another person
of the same gender.

595
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,069
You had to have three articles
of male clothing

596
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:18,613
over or under your dress

597
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:20,735
or they would arrest you
for fraud.

598
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:25,064
And when that
Stonewall incident happened,

599
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:26,911
it just became a thing of...

600
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,903
the shit just finally
hit the fan.

601
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,303
I was there
when the fighting started.

602
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:34,501
I got knocked out.

603
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,961
Thank God, or they would have
continued to beat me

604
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:39,009
until I couldn't have walked.

605
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:42,201
And it went on for days.

606
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,001
Did it change things?

607
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,130
It did for the gay
and lesbian community.

608
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:49,403
Did it change things
for my transgender community?

609
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:50,528
It really didn't.

610
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:54,362
We're the third or fourth letter
in that alphabet soup

611
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:56,304
thing that they have, GLBT.

612
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,297
Well, to me,
"T" should have been first.

613
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,256
We were there doing
most of the fighting,

614
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,763
so let's start there,
and then let's get

615
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,163
the gay and lesbian and bi.

616
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:07,762
We were unemployable.

617
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,362
I gotta eat.
I'm hungry.

618
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:11,101
And like
Scarlett O'Hara says,

619
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:14,595
"Child, I will never
be fuckin' hungry again."

620
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,824
So it was a matter of doing

621
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,327
what you needed to do
to survive.

622
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:21,226
I hooked up with some girls
who hooked a lot.

623
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:23,256
I learned how to boost

624
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:25,898
and rob johns
without them knowing it.

625
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:28,952
I got arrested
for getting in a fight

626
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,298
with a cop
and knocking him out.

627
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,020
He tore my silk
organza dress, girl.

628
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,093
That is not
a thing to do.

629
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,750
Took me too long to find
that dress at my size.

630
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,626
You want me?
Catch me.

631
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,689
So, he caught me,
and I wound up going to jail.

632
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:48,218
While you're in there,
you were suffering

633
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,291
the same abuses
that you were suffering

634
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:52,716
while you were outside
the prison wall.

635
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,490
And the assaults
are not just physical.

636
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,885
They're mental,
spiritual, and emotional,

637
00:30:57,886 --> 00:30:59,886
so it was hard.

638
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:01,585
It was very--

639
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:03,615
it was-- it was hard.

640
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:06,914
We're not safe.

641
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:10,287
We are running around
with targets on our back.

642
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:12,982
We have to constantly
be on our guard.

643
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:18,042
Constantly watching what anyone
and everyone is doing around us.

644
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,849
I got gray worrying
about all that stuff
all the time.

645
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,247
I want to make sure
that every young girl has

646
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:28,546
an opportunity to get
to this point safely

647
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:31,646
with the least amount
of bullshit happening to her

648
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:35,045
and knocking her on her ass
and trying to keep her down.

649
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:40,741
I want us to get a chance to
appreciate smelling a rose,

650
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:43,113
walking through the park
without your shoes on

651
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,840
to feel the grass
on your toes.

652
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:47,512
Go to Monterey
and walk on the white sand.

653
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,709
Oh!

654
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,539
And those are things that
we don't get a chance to do.

655
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,611
What would I like
my legacy to be?

656
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,509
She came, she cared, she left.

657
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,673
What else would there be?

658
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:16,738
Bathrooms is sort of

659
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:19,036
like the focal point

660
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,037
of trans issues?

661
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:23,332
Ooh, the bathroom.

662
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:24,805
What do we do
about the bathroom?

663
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:27,172
It does start to...

664
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,628
collapse that structure
of two-gender

665
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:34,303
that has been here
for so long.

666
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,330
Just bathrooms.

667
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,803
We all gotta use 'em.

668
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,599
Doesn't have to
be so protected.

669
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,969
Not the Pentagon,
just a bathroom.

670
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,795
In the fifth grade,
they have actual,

671
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,668
like, multi-stall bathrooms.

672
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,895
That was the year where

673
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,227
I started going by Nicole
and I started wearing skirts

674
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,030
and had my ears pierced
and everything.

675
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:55,170
That was really what marked
transition for me.

676
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,296
We'd worked with the school
and they said,

677
00:32:58,296 --> 00:33:01,925
"We think that it'd be best
if she have her own space

678
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,668
away from the other students."

679
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:08,860
I had a staff member
six feet behind me at all times.

680
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,660
If I wanted to get up
and go to the bathroom

681
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,320
in the middle of class,
I had to wait

682
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,765
for the staff member
to come with me

683
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,789
to make sure that I didn't go
into the girls' bathroom.

684
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,061
And it really made me feel
like I was an outsider

685
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:25,117
and that I wasn't fit
to be with the other kids.

686
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:27,194
Like there was
something wrong with me.

687
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:30,492
This is very,

688
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:35,088
very common
among trans youth everywhere.

689
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,118
Someone's gotta say
somethin' about it.

690
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:39,761
A year after middle school,

691
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:43,714
we had filed a lawsuit
for wrongful discrimination

692
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,319
based off of my gender,

693
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,689
which was protected
under Title IX.

694
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:48,786
It took a while.

695
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:52,685
I think it was
six years it took. Wow.

696
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:57,484
When the Susan Doe
versus RSU 26 case was decided,

697
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,183
I was in the lunchroom,
you know, doin' my business,

698
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:01,483
I think I was
eating waffle fries,

699
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,583
and I got a text
from my mom.

700
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,112
It was just, you know,
all capital letters,

701
00:34:06,116 --> 00:34:09,186
lots of exclamation points,
"We won!"

702
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,511
You know, I was running around
telling everybody.

703
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,654
This case is really
a landmark case,

704
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:16,407
'cause this is the first time
a court has ruled

705
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,253
in favor of a trans youth.

706
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,105
This is what happened in Maine,

707
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:22,383
now we can make it
happen other places.

708
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,579
The dreaded bathrooms
aren't gonna be

709
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:27,578
something that we're all
so afraid of anymore.

710
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:29,908
We can just pee in peace.

711
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:33,043
I'm an identical twin.

712
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:34,674
I have a twin brother, Jonas.

713
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:36,276
I'm older by 10 minutes.

714
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:38,406
Growing up with somebody

715
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,308
who was an exact mirror
of what I could have been

716
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:45,877
was scary to me
when I was little.

717
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:49,144
He was always what society
sort of expected of me.

718
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:55,170
I started hormone blockers
right before I started puberty.

719
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:59,942
We totally cut off testosterone,
and it worked amazing.

720
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:05,544
I can't stress enough
how I dodged a bullet.

721
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,743
Our journey was a family one.

722
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:14,369
My dad struggled
for a while and said,
"You're not a girl."

723
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,139
"Yes, I am."
"No, you're not."
"Yes, I am."

724
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:17,595
"No, you're not."
"Yes, I am.

725
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,871
"Dad, you've gotta face it.

726
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,938
"You've got a son,
you've got a daughter.

727
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,134
There's nothing
you can do about it."

728
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,837
Well, I think
it was really my mom

729
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:28,033
that helped
my dad come around.

730
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:30,733
She left Jennifer Boylan's book

731
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,662
"She's Not There"
on the coffee table.

732
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,735
She didn't tell him to read it.

733
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,032
She just sort of left it there.

734
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:37,791
And it didn't work
on the coffee table,

735
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,697
so she did
the next best thing.

736
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:41,597
She put it in the bathroom.

737
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,936
Couple days later,

738
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,260
the book wasn't
in the bathroom anymore.

739
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:47,688
When he got on-board...

740
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,965
he got on-board.

741
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:56,027
He's just totally become
this figure in the community

742
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,557
and it's amazing to watch

743
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,130
his transformation
as well as mine.

744
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:06,163
To a young person whose parents
aren't necessarily on-board,

745
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,488
I'd say you gotta
advocate for you.

746
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:10,161
That's what I did
with my parents.

747
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,487
You know,
they wouldn't have known
if I really wasn't as vocal.

748
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,390
Advocate for yourself.

749
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,559
Do not take no for an answer.

750
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,256
Do not settle for less.

751
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,686
This is your life.

752
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,228
Just save yourself.

753
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:25,851
Slay your own dragon.

754
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:26,925
You can do it.

755
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:37,456
The United States Military

756
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:39,952
is a hypermasculine
environment.

757
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,184
There's only
three percent female,

758
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,054
so the United States
Marine Corps is alpha male,

759
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:47,821
straight forward,
hooah-hooah, hardcore, oorah,

760
00:36:47,818 --> 00:36:49,217
you know,
badass motherfuckers.

761
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,816
They don't have time
to be worrying about,

762
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,316
like, who's peeing in a ditch
and who's peeing standing up.

763
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:54,845
They're just wanting
to get the mission done.

764
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,649
My performance standard
was so high

765
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:57,949
that nobody really
gave a shit.

766
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,478
It was like,
"That dude's awesome at his job.

767
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:04,180
That dude's a chick. All right."

768
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,280
It's just gonna
fall off the table.
And they just let it go.

769
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,920
No one's just gonna
come and square off.

770
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,373
I mean, now I'm bigger,

771
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,449
but even then I was
a badass motherfucker.

772
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,975
I was just, you know,
140 pounds versus 180 pounds.

773
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,214
The first time I went to Iraq,

774
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,340
I was only 18.

775
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:25,113
Two weeks in, I saw
a woman get stoned,

776
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,370
I watched one
of my best friends get

777
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,816
his legs blown off.

778
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,039
It's everything
you can imagine.

779
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,072
It smells bad,

780
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:31,846
it's hot, it's sandy.

781
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:34,711
There's a lot of chaos,
a lotta high anxiety,

782
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,338
a lotta high-stress moments.

783
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,611
That first deployment
to Fallujah,

784
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,167
more than a third
of our Marines

785
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,513
were killed in action
or wounded.

786
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:45,006
My particular platoon
only had 30 people,

787
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,736
and when we came back,
we only had

788
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:48,939
12 of the original people
we'd deployed with.

789
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:50,368
It was really hard
to deal with.

790
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,141
I'm still dealing with it.

791
00:37:57,537 --> 00:38:00,336
I learned about discrimination
from a very young age.

792
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:05,108
I grew up
on reservation land.

793
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:07,562
My great-grandmother
and-- and my grandmother are

794
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,607
both 100% First Nation Cherokee.

795
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,464
I lived with
my great-grandmother

796
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,367
off and on during the summers
during my childhood.

797
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:18,366
I always heard her stories
of what it was like to be,

798
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,335
you know, an indigenous
person in America.

799
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,402
My family's people
were originally settlers

800
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:24,857
in the Virginia area,
and they got pushed to Kentucky.

801
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:27,265
So, I had
first-person accounts

802
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,604
of what it was
to face adversity.

803
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:33,004
When I went in
the United States Marine Corps,

804
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:36,256
it was still under
"Don't ask, don't tell."

805
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:38,032
I think that my recruiter
thought I was a lesbian,

806
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,328
and so like, he made me sign
that waiver that says, like,

807
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:41,758
I'm not a homosexual
or whatever,

808
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:43,661
but he gave me this odd look
while I was signing it.

809
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,900
I definitely felt
the oppression

810
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:50,024
as far as it applies
to sexuality.

811
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,856
I identify as queer
or pansexual.

812
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,730
For me, it was kind of
like a sense of panic.

813
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:54,856
It's like a witch hunt.

814
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,399
Somebody's gonna,
like, jump out of the woods

815
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,921
and be like,
"Ah, gotcha!"

816
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:01,754
Legally speaking,

817
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,927
for the last five years,
I am male.

818
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,324
My military passport,

819
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:07,953
my official red military
passport says "male."

820
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:09,857
With the Department
of Social Security, I'm male.

821
00:39:09,857 --> 00:39:13,596
But the entry system
which holds the data

822
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,089
for every service member,

823
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,018
male, five-six, blah-blah-blah,

824
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,221
that hasn't changed for me.

825
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:21,390
I still have to be
addressed by members

826
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:23,316
of my senior command
as female.

827
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
I'm not allowed
to correct people,

828
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,649
because it's military law.

829
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:29,252
Uh, I can't be like,
"Hey, you're using
the wrong pronoun,"

830
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:31,291
because technically speaking,
they're in the right.

831
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:33,984
Being listed as a female
but being seen as male

832
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,045
with your peers,
probably one of the largest

833
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:38,321
reasons why my anxiety level
is really high.

834
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:40,587
I never know which bathroom
to use at work,

835
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:43,313
so I just conveniently
always, like, use the bathroom

836
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:44,686
when somebody else
is not there.

837
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,183
But I usually use
the men's bathroom

838
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:49,481
because it's really
inappropriate to, like,
walk in-- in a female.

839
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:51,841
It's just always
a really weird situation.

840
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:55,717
I was going
to the Pentagon

841
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:58,213
and they wanted me to wear
a female dress uniform.

842
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:01,643
To do that was
incredibly humiliating.

843
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,715
Like, the civilians there
were interacting,

844
00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:05,482
but they were like, "Sir,
that's a woman's uniform,"

845
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,838
and I'm like,
"I know."

846
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:10,608
The United States Military

847
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:11,711
uses a medical code

848
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,910
based on the "DSM-IV,"

849
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,180
which is very, very outdated.

850
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,475
If you're transgendered,

851
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,076
it says it's
a psychosexual condition,

852
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:21,936
which is-- also lines up
with bedwetting, dementia.

853
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:24,682
Everything is still
as it was before.

854
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:25,935
You have to pretend to be

855
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,142
this other person
that you're not.

856
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,680
There's been
no accommodations
made for anyone.

857
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,676
I've always just
been this guy

858
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:35,433
that always just kinda
wanted to help people.

859
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:38,108
I saw that no one was
advocating for military rights

860
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:41,135
for trans military people,
and I felt that

861
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,837
people needed to see,
"Hey, I'm an American soldier,

862
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:46,608
I can do this job,
and I do it well."

863
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,873
Martin Luther King says,
"If not me, then who?"

864
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,300
You know,
"If not now, then when?"

865
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:51,533
So, I had to do something.

866
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,175
I swore to serve and protect
the people of the United States

867
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,598
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

868
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,571
What are you gonna do?

869
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:01,228
You're gonna
protect them, right?

870
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:14,102
What is normal?

871
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,201
Let's be honest,
everybody has their stuff.

872
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:22,127
This happens to be my stuff.

873
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,499
This is what I dealt with
all my life, secretively,

874
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,996
behind closed doors.

875
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:30,725
I just couldn't
do it any longer.

876
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:33,897
I'm just so lucky in life.

877
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:36,324
I'm this white,
privileged older guy,

878
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,096
ya know, financially all set
and this and that.

879
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:41,223
"Oh, it's a different
story for you."

880
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:44,495
Every journey
has its struggle.

881
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:49,894
Mine...
I had to do it publicly

882
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:54,760
in front of literally
billions of people

883
00:41:54,757 --> 00:42:00,216
with their perception
of, "Oh, my God, Bruce Jenner,

884
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:04,891
'Mr. Male Athlete
of the World,' is really trans."

885
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:08,918
Going from a very positive
masculine figure

886
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:13,561
to what a lot of people perceive
as a feminine, weak figure...

887
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,160
publicly, not easy to do.

888
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:26,084
I'm comfortable
in my womanhood.

889
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,284
But what does
that really mean?

890
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:30,953
What is this thing "female"?

891
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,950
I still struggle with that.

892
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,510
It's more than hair
and makeup.

893
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:37,185
It's more than
the pitch of your voice.

894
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,951
I didn't grow up
having my first period.

895
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,778
I didn't grow up
on my first date.

896
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,281
I didn't have
all of these things

897
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,180
that all women experience.

898
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:47,746
I am a trans woman.

899
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:50,406
My experience is different

900
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:52,582
and I think I am different
than other women,

901
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:56,348
and I never want to disrespect
women from that standpoint,

902
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:59,744
but I'm much more comfortable
over on that side,

903
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,374
and that's the first time
in my life I can ever say that.

904
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:05,007
All of a sudden now, I am...

905
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:09,750
like this spokesperson
for the trans community.

906
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:12,072
Not even close.

907
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:16,004
I am an expert on my story.

908
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,778
Nobody else's.

909
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,144
I would love to show
other stories through the media,

910
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,699
and yes, I do have
a platform here,

911
00:43:22,706 --> 00:43:24,976
and that platform
is very important.

912
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,499
I can't go out
and help anybody else

913
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:32,644
or talk about this issue
if I'm not so clear

914
00:43:32,638 --> 00:43:35,967
in my soul
about who I am
as a person,

915
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,370
and this is who I am.

916
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,640
For the first time in my life,

917
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:43,796
I wake up in the morning
and I don't have any more

918
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:46,702
secrets stored up
in my soul.

919
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:50,398
Growing up,
I was a dyslexic kid.

920
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:53,300
Suffered from terrible
low self-esteem.

921
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,400
I had gender issues
all the time.

922
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,196
My outlet

923
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,838
to prove my masculinity
was to play sports.

924
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:04,262
'Cause that was all of me.

925
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:05,765
That was the little trans kid,

926
00:44:05,765 --> 00:44:07,794
that was
the little dyslexic kid,

927
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:10,398
that was a person
with great drive.

928
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:15,963
When the games were over with,
I got up the next morning,

929
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:17,392
I put the gold medal
around my neck

930
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:18,495
and I looked in the mirror,

931
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:19,895
not a stitch of clothes on,
and I said,

932
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:21,436
"Oh, my God,
now what do I do?"

933
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,386
You know,
now I look back on it,

934
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:28,863
"Go, Bruce!"

935
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,760
But we've moved on.

936
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:35,232
A sense of humor
is extremely important.

937
00:44:35,225 --> 00:44:36,825
This is pretty funny.

938
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:39,755
Ya know, me of all people,
the big Bruce Jenner,

939
00:44:39,758 --> 00:44:41,588
ya know, dealing
with these issues.

940
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:44,330
That in itself is a sketch
on "Saturday Night Live."

941
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:45,683
For Halloween,
they were coming up

942
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,929
with a Caitlyn Jenner
Halloween costume,

943
00:44:47,923 --> 00:44:50,923
the bustier I wore
on the cover of "Vanity Fair."

944
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:53,082
I think it's
pretty funny, ya know?

945
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:54,658
And boy, some people
in the community go,

946
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,755
"How can you do that?
How disparaging."

947
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:58,554
You know, "You're putting
trans people down,"

948
00:44:58,554 --> 00:44:59,954
and stuff like--
and I said,

949
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:02,184
"No, I'm thinkin'
I like to go through life
with a sense of humor."

950
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:04,786
And to me, that was--
yeah, that was funny.

951
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,449
I feel so blessed

952
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,752
that I did transition
later on in life

953
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:11,582
'cause I loved raising my kids.

954
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:13,254
I loved carpooling my kids.

955
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,151
They were just great.

956
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,980
They said,
"Can we still
call you Daddy?"

957
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:20,784
I said,
"Of course you can
still call me Daddy.

958
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:25,583
"I'm gonna be your dad
until the last day I'm here
on Earth, okay?

959
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,282
I'm always going to
be your father."

960
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:31,878
My daughter-in-law
just had a little girl.

961
00:45:31,882 --> 00:45:36,051
She will only grow up
knowing Caitlyn.

962
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:39,016
I thought,
"Isn't that so cool?"

963
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:41,213
So of course we're trying
to come up with a name.

964
00:45:42,946 --> 00:45:44,875
I don't know
if we're gonna go with it,

965
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:48,748
but they came up with...
Boom-Boom.

966
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:51,544
Why Boom-Boom?
I don't know,

967
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:54,913
but it seemed to stick
with all my kids in the room

968
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,210
to call me Boom-Boom.

969
00:45:56,209 --> 00:45:57,669
And I've been called worse.

970
00:45:57,676 --> 00:45:59,975
Yeah, I've been called worse.

971
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:01,376
Yeah.

972
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,445
Ah.

973
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:07,641
Remember, keep
your sense of humor.

974
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,710
Gender is an essence.

975
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:28,364
Personality.

976
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:33,869
The power of gender is precisely
that it can never be defined.

977
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,969
I don't think
that gender is fixed.

978
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,869
I think that gender can actually
change every single day.

979
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:41,808
Myself is many selves.

980
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:44,401
One day I might
feel really masculine,

981
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,430
one day I might
feel really feminine.

982
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,833
The next day,
I might feel neither,

983
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,302
and every single day,
I should have the autonomy

984
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:53,358
to self-determine
who I want to be.

985
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,064
I identify as non-binary,

986
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,403
which means I don't identify
as either a man or a woman,

987
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:04,397
but I identify as femme,
and I understand femininity

988
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:06,526
to not be the same thing
as womanhood.

989
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,059
I think femininity exists

990
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:12,301
outside of bodies and outside
of one type of gender.

991
00:47:12,294 --> 00:47:15,753
My femme identity is part
of a long ancestral lineage

992
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:18,661
of all the feminine people
in my life who have done

993
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,699
so much profound emotional
and social work,

994
00:47:21,693 --> 00:47:23,753
but have been
completely discredited.

995
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,960
Like caretaking,

996
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,699
helping people process trauma,
grief, or depression,

997
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:28,792
cooking for people.

998
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:31,021
These are all things
that are substantive

999
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:33,094
and real and powerful,
but we're taught

1000
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,949
from our society that
they're insignificant and wrong.

1001
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:38,297
For me, identifying
as femme is about saying,

1002
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,819
"No thank you, patriarchy.

1003
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,452
"My strength comes
from my femininity,

1004
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,125
and my femininity is not
confined to just my body."

1005
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:51,693
So much of what Western culture
is obsessed with is the body.

1006
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:54,817
We live in a culture that's
routinely fat-shaming people,

1007
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,549
policing people's skin tones,

1008
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:59,852
holding up certain bodies
to be more desirable
than other bodies.

1009
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:02,692
Why are we so fixated
on people's physicality?

1010
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:04,445
We literally have
a women's movement today

1011
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:07,350
that says being a woman
means having a vagina.

1012
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,150
That's the most
misogynist equation

1013
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,590
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

1014
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:13,113
Patriarchal society
has taught us that

1015
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:16,615
women are just vaginas,
that women are just mothers,

1016
00:48:16,615 --> 00:48:19,685
that women are just
reproductive agents.

1017
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:23,511
Feminism should be about
complicating that narrative.

1018
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:27,013
Constantly,
people will tell me,

1019
00:48:27,013 --> 00:48:29,643
"You're just a man
because of how you look,"

1020
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:31,086
and I have to step back
and be like,

1021
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,978
"Let's check a lot of those
assumptions you're making there.

1022
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:36,838
"One, you're assuming that
just because a doctor

1023
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:39,085
"told my mother
when I was born

1024
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:41,906
"that I was a boy
that that should be my fate

1025
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,110
for the rest of my life."

1026
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,910
I'm fighting for a world
where people can actually have

1027
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,779
the self-determination
to choose who they are.

1028
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:52,175
There's no one way
to look like a woman,

1029
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:54,634
there's no one way to look
like a man or a femme.

1030
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,611
There's just a way
to look like yourself.

1031
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:02,602
I think that there have
always been people like me.

1032
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,936
Learning that is so important.

1033
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:10,609
In India, there's
a long ancestral tradition
of gender nonconformity.

1034
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:13,104
We have gods
who changed genders,

1035
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:15,234
and in large parts
of South Asia, you can be

1036
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:17,806
represented as the third gender
on your identity document.

1037
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:21,803
When the British colonized us,

1038
00:49:21,803 --> 00:49:24,572
they created the first types
of colonial legislation

1039
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:26,799
which defined trans
people as "eunuchs,"

1040
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:30,401
a.k.a. defined trans people
as men without penises.

1041
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,801
and it became a fixation
on our genitalia.

1042
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:38,372
They criminalized us and taught
our own people to hate us

1043
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:40,726
even though
for thousands of years,

1044
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:43,732
my cultures had found
ways to understand gender

1045
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,432
as a relationship
with our land,

1046
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:47,531
our relationship
with our families,

1047
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,270
our relationship
to caretaking.

1048
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:52,093
All of those infinite ways
of understanding gender

1049
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:54,666
were lost and made
into genitalia.

1050
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:57,693
And that has everything do
with the history of colonialism.

1051
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:02,728
Liberation looks
like every single person

1052
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:05,728
being able to
self-determine their identity

1053
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:08,468
without fear
of persecution or violence.

1054
00:50:08,461 --> 00:50:11,790
I shouldn't have to modify
my body in order to be safe

1055
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:14,622
and I should not
be victim-blamed
for being who I am.

1056
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:18,295
I should be able to wear
a skirt, a dress, a beard,

1057
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:22,161
interchangeably all the above,
with no fear.

1058
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,059
I grew up in a world
that taught me that

1059
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,255
I should be
confined by my body,

1060
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:35,084
but I refuse
to accept that.

1061
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:38,288
And that is a lesson
that I think everyone
could learn from.

1062
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:41,517
You are so much more
tremendous and incredible

1063
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,689
than something so simple
as what you look like.

1064
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:56,617
I've always known that
I wanted to be a performer.

1065
00:50:57,884 --> 00:50:59,953
In the black church,
there was this whole thing

1066
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,150
about being made over,
about being sort of,

1067
00:51:02,149 --> 00:51:04,679
you know, transformed
by the spirit or something.

1068
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:06,452
And I think that
very early on,

1069
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:08,609
I wanted to be
sort of transformed

1070
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:13,154
by art and by television
and by the theater.

1071
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:17,513
As a kid
in Mobile, Alabama,

1072
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,283
my environment
was not necessarily

1073
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,609
the most affirming place,

1074
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,252
but in my imagination,

1075
00:51:23,245 --> 00:51:26,304
I could go anywhere,
and my imagination saved me.

1076
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:30,204
The first time
I saw Leontyne Price

1077
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,180
was when I was five
or six years old.

1078
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:34,277
"Evening at Pops,"
Boston Pops,

1079
00:51:34,277 --> 00:51:35,676
which they used to
do on PBS.

1080
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,606
And she was this
regal black woman

1081
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:39,109
with big,
full lips like me,

1082
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:43,178
and high cheekbones,
and she had so much dignity.

1083
00:51:43,175 --> 00:51:45,544
And she was singing
"Un bel di vedremo"

1084
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,541
from "Madama Butterfly,"
and it was sort of just

1085
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:51,770
this big, huge,
rich, smoky voice

1086
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:54,003
coming from this elegant woman.

1087
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:56,445
And it was just--
I was like,

1088
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:57,939
"I wanna be like that."

1089
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:02,341
I started begging my mother
to put me into dance classes

1090
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,998
when I was five,
and I danced around everywhere.

1091
00:52:05,004 --> 00:52:07,443
There was a lot
of gender policing

1092
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,797
from people at church
and my teachers,

1093
00:52:09,804 --> 00:52:11,073
particularly in
elementary school.

1094
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:12,699
A teacher would say,
"You need to take

1095
00:52:12,703 --> 00:52:14,403
"that child out
of those dance classes.

1096
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:16,241
"Those dance classes are
making them gay,

1097
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:17,634
or gonna make--
turn them gay,"

1098
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,395
and, "You're acting
like a girl."

1099
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:20,871
My mom said,
"No, no, no.

1100
00:52:20,868 --> 00:52:23,597
I will let my child
do what they want to do."

1101
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,593
I had a dance scholarship
to Indiana University

1102
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,899
and then to Marymount.

1103
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,599
I got to travel
all over the country
'cause of art.

1104
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:36,794
Art has consistently been
this thing that has

1105
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:40,738
saved my life, and it sort of
rescued me from darkness.

1106
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:44,793
As a black trans woman,

1107
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:46,866
it is difficult to get a job.

1108
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:49,492
I mean, like three years ago,
I was barely paying my rent.

1109
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:51,195
Like I was literally
in housing court,

1110
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:53,034
you know,
trying to avoid eviction.

1111
00:52:54,695 --> 00:52:59,664
Working at Lucky Cheng's,
a restaurant that dubbed itself

1112
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,090
the "drag queen capital
of the world,"

1113
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:06,062
as a trans woman
was deeply challenging.

1114
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:10,728
The clientele at Lucky Cheng's
came for a spectacle,

1115
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:11,925
came for the spectacle

1116
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:15,284
of what they perceived
to be men in dresses.

1117
00:53:16,957 --> 00:53:20,026
My identity as a trans woman
is not a joke.

1118
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:24,051
However, I'm a performer
and I'm an actress,

1119
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:26,155
and I was there
doing a job.

1120
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:28,184
I am not sure
I would have had a job

1121
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:30,527
if it were not
for Lucky Cheng's.

1122
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:32,381
The trans women
and the queens

1123
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:34,456
that I worked with are
some of the best people

1124
00:53:34,453 --> 00:53:36,923
that I've ever known.

1125
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,619
I would not be here if it
were not for that sisterhood.

1126
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:44,684
For years,
I would audition

1127
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,985
for agents
and casting directors,

1128
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:50,153
and they would say,
"You know, uh, maybe
you should move to L.A.

1129
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,480
"There's not really work
for you trans people.

1130
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:53,722
"There's stuff here and there.

1131
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:55,546
I don't know
what to do with you."

1132
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:58,418
And there was just,
like, people telling me

1133
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:00,115
that I probably wouldn't
be able to do this.

1134
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:04,717
The morning I found out I was
nominated for an Emmy,

1135
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:08,473
I was in my tiny
studio apartment in New York.

1136
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,349
It was like a...

1137
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:12,616
It was incredible.

1138
00:54:12,613 --> 00:54:14,612
And I think it meant a lot to

1139
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,612
a lot of trans people out there

1140
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:18,641
who thought
that a trans person

1141
00:54:18,644 --> 00:54:20,844
will never have
this kind of moment.

1142
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,973
I've always been
in this place with my looks

1143
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:26,476
where it's not enough.

1144
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:27,876
I'm tall,
I have broad shoulders,

1145
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:30,846
I have big hands,
I have a deep voice,
I have big feet.

1146
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:32,912
I'm recognizably trans.

1147
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:36,368
For many years, I would
sort of like sort of cower

1148
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,574
and sort of try
to make myself disappear

1149
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:40,143
so people
wouldn't notice that.

1150
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,470
I can't make myself disappear.

1151
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,373
I'm a--
I'm a big presence,

1152
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:46,342
and so I had to start
owning this trans thing.

1153
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:47,369
This is it.

1154
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:48,572
Yes, I'm trans.

1155
00:54:48,572 --> 00:54:51,671
It's wonderful, it's beautiful,
I'm gonna own this.

1156
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:56,467
I'm starting to believe
in my own power.

1157
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,170
My voice matters.

1158
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,309
My truth matters.

1159
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:04,033
We live in a world

1160
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:08,535
that tells so many people
that they're not enough.

1161
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,004
I'm here to tell you that you are.

1162
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,300
You-- you're enough
just as who you are.
