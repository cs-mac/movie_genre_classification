lost and now I'm stuck.

162
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:13,496
Where are you?

163
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:17,657
I turned off Crane Street.

164
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:22,079
Crane Street? What are
you doing on Crane Street?

165
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,411
There was a mess up, there was a
mess up at the rental car and-

166
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:32,127
You have the wrong car?
I don't understand.

167
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,855
Michael?

168
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,862
Angie, do you love me?

169
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:42,972
What?

170
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,281
You heard me.

171
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,413
Michael, what's going on?

172
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:49,690
Because if
you really love me-

173
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:53,140
I need you to tell me
how to get to Smuts Street.

174
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,793
And then I need you to not
ask me any more questions.

175
00:19:56,847 --> 00:20:00,026
And please, just give me twenty
more, twenty more minutes,

176
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,586
and if I'm not there
within twenty minutes,

177
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,278
you don't ever have to
talk to me again. Okay?

178
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,465
Go back.

179
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:19,250
Go back on Crane,
take a right on Gull, um,

180
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:21,526
and then the third left
at the light is Smuts.

181
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,112
All right.

182
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:25,843
All right, I love you.

183
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,447
(starts car)

184
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,391
I'm not gonna hurt
you, I swear to God.

185
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,903
I'm gonna take
this gag off, okay?

186
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,003
Are you all right?

187
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,785
(Rachel) Water.

188
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,072
Can you untie me?

189
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:10,211
Yeah.

190
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:18,629
(crash)

191
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,542
Are you crazy?

192
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:33,890
Who are you?

193
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,422
They wouldn't have left
this to some random guy,

194
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:36,838
so don't play the innocent man!

195
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:40,805
You just sit back, all right?

196
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,661
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about and I

197
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,965
don't really care. You just sit
there and you shut up. Just sit

198
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,902
in your seat. Just, just stay
there! Just- This is crazy!

199
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,331
Oh, God.

200
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:51,711
Turn the car around.

201
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:55,099
Turn the car around.

202
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:56,214
I don't wanna hear it.

203
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:58,874
Listen to what I say
and you won't get hurt.

204
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,626
(cocks gun)
Turn the car around.

205
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,980
I don't have anything to
do with this, all right?

206
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,113
Not a thing. I don't have
any involvement in this.

207
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,966
You're driving too fast.
Slow down.

208
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,018
I said slow down!

209
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:27,157
(gun shot)

210
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:49,906
Enough!

211
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:51,952
Okay, okay, okay! Okay,
okay, okay! Okay, okay, okay!

212
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:15,788
What are you doing?

213
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,846
(car horn)

214
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:30,067
Stay in the car!
Stay in the car!

215
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:36,914
You don't know
what you're doing.

216
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:40,655
Sit down!

217
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:45,577
You just don't-
(cell rings)

218
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,099
Hello.

219
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:50,598
(Detective Smith)
You're late, Michael Woods.

220
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

221
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,608
You got out of jail
only ten days ago.

222
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,226
I checked your record. Already
broken your parole condition

223
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:00,111
by leaving the country.
An ex-wife at the embassy.

224
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,452
Is that where you're going?

225
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,462
No, no, I'm on my
way to you right now.

226
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,226
Do you wanna go back
to jail, Mister Woods?

227
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:06,221
NO-

228
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,229
Five minutes or
we're coming for you.

229
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,666
I'm coming. There's a woman,

230
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:13,735
there's a woman tied up in
the back- (disconnects)

231
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:15,621
Hello?

232
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,899
Just, just stay in your seat!

233
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,419
Please just stay in
your seat, all right?

234
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:28,587
Just stay there. Don't
move. Nothin'! Just stay there.

235
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,679
You don't know what's
going on, do you?

236
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:57,158
I think I need to explain the
situation you find yourself in.

237
00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:59,080
You're talkin' to
the wrong person.

238
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:01,317
My name is Rachel Shabangu.

239
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:04,101
I work for the National
Prosecuting Authority.

240
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,326
I have recently uncovered
information implicating a very

241
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:13,096
powerful man named Ben Rose in
various counts of international

242
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:17,155
sex trafficking. The last
thing I remember is going home,

243
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:19,744
opening my front door,
then waking up in this minivan

244
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:22,749
with you. I have reason to
believe I have been kidnapped

245
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,211
to prevent this information
from coming to light.

246
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:27,423
You know, I don't wanna
hear any of this. All right?

247
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,354
I don't wanna hear any of it.

248
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:29,883
You have to do the right thing.

249
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:32,065
You know what? You just
save it, all right?

250
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,506
You can just save it for
the police when we get there-

251
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,989
Ben Rose is the Chief of Police.

252
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:43,100
It's the police
that want me dead.

253
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:51,744
Look, I don't know how you got
involved in this, but you are.

254
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:52,890
No.

255
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,936
This is my reality, and
it's just become yours.

256
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:55,958
No, it hasn't become my reality!

257
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,731
You may
not like it-

258
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:57,781
This isn't my reality.

259
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,319
Sometimes life
doesn't give us a choice-

260
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:00,539
I gotta do what I gotta-

261
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,753
You're in this
situation for a reason!

262
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:02,839
I just got to stay out
of trouble right now!

263
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,538
You have to do the right thing.

264
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,174
- No, I don't! You shut up!
- Don't you care-_

265
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,035
Shut up!

266
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:08,085
You can't-

267
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,370
Argh!

268
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,530
(birds)

269
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,248
This isn't right.

270
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:12,243
(gun shot)

271
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:15,281
Go! Go! Go!

272
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:16,628
Why are they shooting at us?

273
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:18,604
Just get the hell out of here!
Just go, go, go! Go, go go!

274
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,052
I'm going, I'm going!

275
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,653
Get back onto the main road!

276
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,597
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

277
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,329
(Michael) I'm goin', I'm goin'!

278
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,631
Give me the gun.

279
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:37,357
Give me the gun!

280
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,534
These people are going to
kill us! Give me the gun!

281
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:40,552
(gun shots)

282
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:42,604
Will you give me the gun?

283
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:46,992
(gun shot)
Faster!

284
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,554
(gun shots)

285
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,537

Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

288
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,223
Go faster! Go!

289
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:55,118
I'm going, I'm going!

290
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:59,177
Go! Go!

291
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:00,265
Keep shooting!

292
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,285
Go!

293
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay, hey! Hey!

294
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:08,046
What?

When I say duck inside
you duck inside!

296

Hear me?

297
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:17,767
There's a wall!

00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:21,704
I know! When say duck
inside you get inside! Now!

We're gonna have to

325
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,023
Benji!

326
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,141
They threatened my son.
At his school. You know

327
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:03,728
what I'm saying? At his
school. He is only eight.

328
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:07,882
Please. Leave me alone.

329
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,799
Threatened his son?

330
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:22,417
That means they're gonna go after
my wife. She's at the embassy.

331
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,346
(Rachel) Call her. Whatever
happens, she must stay where she is.

332

(phone) Hey, it's Angie.
You know what to do. (beep)

334
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,251
Angie, listen, I need you
to stay put. I don't want

335
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,207
you to move. I want you to
stay right where you're at.

336
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,547
There's some guys-

337
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:43,689
Listen, just stay
where are, all right?

338
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,931
I'm on my way. I'm comin'
to get you right now.

339
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,293
You can't go there.

340
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:49,733
I have to go there.

341
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,765
These people are dangerous
and they will kill us.

342
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,646
She's safe. They can't
get to her at the embassy.

343
00:34:58,368 --> 00:35:00,803
I don't care.
|'m goin'.

344
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,222
Give me the phone.

345
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,061
What department at the embassy?

346
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:19,204
Uh, diplomatic. Um-

347

It's on the phone.
Look on the phone.

348
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:22,912
It's gonna be okay.

349
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:25,638
She's safe there, as
long as she stays inside.

Diplomatic Affairs, please?

353
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,281
Not a problem, ma'am.

354
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:39,686

like to speak to?

I'm sorry, she just stepped out.

359
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:49,953
How long ago?

360
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:52,191
What?

361
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,565
She just stepped out.
There was someone to see her.

362
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:55,677
(squealing tires)

363
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,960
Put on your seatbelt.

364
00:35:58,393 --> 00:36:00,162
It's only a block away.

365
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,199

366

It's red!

368
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:26,937
It's just there.

369
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:28,221
There.

370
00:36:28,277 --> 00:36:29,697
Those are his men!

371
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,593
Wait, there she is!

377
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:49,430
(gasping)

378
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,030

381
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,126
No doctors.
No hospitals.

382
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:01,527
They'|| find us.

383
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:04,247
Turn, turn here.

384
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,113
Turn left here?

385
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:06,196
Turn left.

386
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:09,020
Follow that, that
underground parking sign.

387
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,667
Right there.

388
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,922
(Michael) We can't
just stay down here.

389
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:20,857
Okay.
Go down to the bottom level.

390
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:28,339
Find a place out of sight.

391
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,159
Somewhere where
they can't see us.

392
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,023
(Michael) Here.

393
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,848

Use the sleeve.
Stop it. All right.

400
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:05,617

have to push harder.

402
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:12,342
Just do it!
Push. Push harder.

403
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:13,419

404
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:21,390

407
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,388
You're gonna be fine.

408
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,253

417
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,508
Yeah.

Push it?

422
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:09,860
Mm-hmm.

423
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,734
My name is Rachel Shabangu.

424
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:25,290
Today October 12th, 2011-

425
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,537
I have been shot.

426
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:36,650
In the event that I don't
survive this will serve

427
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:39,618
as testimony for
my prosecution.

428
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:48,393
On September 17th, 2011-

429
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:56,773
I uncovered a sex trafficking
ring out of Johannesburg.

430
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:00,799
It's okay.

431
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:05,406
And a trail
that led back to-

432
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:11,657
Chief of Police-
Ben Rose.

433
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,686
When I realized how
deep not only he,

434
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:30,179
but other high-ranking
officers are involved I tried,

435
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,430
I tried to contact
Judge James Mzuka-

436
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,851
but then found myself-

437
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:51,767
concludes my testimony-

438
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:58,558
witnessed by-

439
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,743
Michael.
Michael Woods.

440
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,437
Michael-
Woods.

441
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:13,847
Come on open your eyes.
Open your eyes. Hey.

442
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:16,221
Open your eyes. I want
you to stay with me, okay?

443
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,912
I don't want this
on my shoulders.

444
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:20,437
You're gonna stay with me.
So I want you just to breathe.

445
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,018
Take it to the courthouse.

446
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:27,766
No, I'm not-

447
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:28,917
To the courthouse.

448
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:30,614
I'm not gonna deal with
the police. Okay? I'm not

449
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,922
even supposed to be here.
You're gonna stay with me.

450
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:36,732
Find Judge Mzuka.

451
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,559
He's the only one you can trust.

452
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,675
No, I'm not-

453
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:43,575
To courthouse.

454
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,651
You stay with me.
Just stay, just-

455
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:50,198
Please. He's the only one
you can trust. No one else.

456
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:52,602
No, I'm not, I'm not trusting
anybody, you understand?

457
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:55,055
You're gonna stay right
here. Okay? You're gonna take it

458
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:57,170
to the judge. You're gonna
do this. You're gonna be fine.

459
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,958
You're gonna be fine. Okay?
I just- you're gonna be fine.

460
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:00,972
I want you to say it.
Just say it.

461
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:02,291
It rests on you.

462
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:04,533
No, this doesn't
rest on me. This rests on you.

463
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,023
This rests on you.
Now you say it. You say-

464
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:07,859
It's up to you now.

No, it's not on me. You s-

466
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:13,940
You stay with me.
Look at me. Look at me.

00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:16,145
Look at me.

468

Look at me.

The caller sounded distressed.

485

You feeling any better now?

486
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:44,013
So how much did our
friend Rachel Shabangu

487
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:45,941
tell you before she died?

488
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,435
You killed her.

489
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:49,582
Hey, hey, hey,
easy there, big boy.

490
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:54,511
Look, Michael, I'm not
the one just out of jail

491
00:46:54,568 --> 00:46:55,594
for a hit and run, okay?

492
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:59,085
It was an accident.
I paid my dues.

493
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:00,618
You don't know me.

494
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:03,858
You do seem to have a bit of
a knack at being in the wrong

495
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,570
place at the wrong time,
don't you, Mister Woods?

496
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,361
Anyway, here's the situation.

497
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:17,486
You've broken your parole
conditions, making you a wanted

498
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:21,331
felon. You're alone in a city
you've never been to before.

499
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,835
Whereas I, on the other hand,
have access to the entire police

500
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:30,162
force here. I know the
car you're in. I know its color.

501
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:33,705
Its plates. I also have
people waiting for your

502
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:36,843
ex-wife to take one
step out of that embassy.

503
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:40,590
One step and she's mine.
So what you gonna do?

504
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,253
Oh, there is one more thing I
thought might help you make the

505
00:47:45,314 --> 00:47:49,071

don't you turn on your radio?

00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:11,589
just stay out of my way, okay?

What?

514
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,114
That's what my father used to
always call me. "Cookie boy. "

515
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:29,827
Said I'd always
crack under pressure.

516

Said I'd always
crumble like a cookie.

522
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:51,711
A sadistic-ass chuckle.

523

And you know, even though he's
dead, every time I screw up,

You do realize that?

May I see your license, please?

643
01:02:57,776 --> 01:03:00,027
Can I see your license, sir?

644
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:06,044
Sir, I need to see your license.

645
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,837
Step out of the car, sir!

646
01:03:16,077 --> 01:03:18,196

Oh, just-

653
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:50,358
it was a cop, but he's
gone now. He, he left.

654
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,271
Michael, listen to me.
It's too dangerous.

655
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:56,085
Do not go anywhere now.
I'm going to send someone.

656
01:03:56,137 --> 01:03:57,579
Just tell me where you are.

Uh-

Yeah. Yeah, um-

Hello, Mister Woods.

719
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,249
This man is a
fugitive from the law.

720

This is a DT matter.

I'll take it from here.

724

I'll blow his head off!

725

NO, You won't.

726
01:12:09,164 --> 01:12:11,796
Yes, I will. Now you get
that judge and you get him now,

727
01:12:11,852 --> 01:12:13,872
or this guy dies.
I swear to God, this guy's

728
01:12:13,932 --> 01:12:16,531
gonna die if you don't
get me the judge right now.

729
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:19,156
Not gonna happen.

730
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:22,959
Don't you push me.
Don't you push me!

731
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:26,132
Haven't you screwed up enough
for one life, Mister Woods?

732
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,620
Right now you're dead center
in the crosshairs of at least

733
01:12:29,674 --> 01:12:33,966
two Class A snipers. I give
the word and you're dead.

734
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:38,764
Don't you push me. I swear
to God, I'm gonna kill him.

735
01:12:38,824 --> 01:12:40,266
I will kill him.

736
01:12:40,776 --> 01:12:43,408
Now you get the judge
or somebody dies.

Is this thing on?

01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:51,952
Yes. Yes. The
camera's running over there.

740
01:12:52,006 --> 01:12:53,743
Make no mistake,
I will shoot you.

741
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:54,792
He's got a hostage,
you can't-

742
01:12:54,854 --> 01:12:57,453
Back off. On my word,
you're a dead man.

743
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,668
Hey, there's protocol here!

744
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:00,527
Unless threatened, you
have no right to fire.

745
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:01,805
I need the judge.

746
01:13:03,397 --> 01:13:04,970
Don't tell me how to do my job.

747
01:13:05,574 --> 01:13:06,796
What's going on here?

748
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:08,295
Just stay out of this.

749
01:13:09,509 --> 01:13:11,465
Tell me, man.
What's going on?

750
01:13:11,844 --> 01:13:12,904
Stay out of this!

751
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:14,603
No, mister you step
back! I've got this!

752
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:15,915
Drop your weapon now!

753
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:16,911
Step back! I've got this!

754
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:18,023
I need the judge now!
- Okay, step back!

755
01:13:18,084 --> 01:13:18,990
Stay out of this!

756
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:19,884
Tell me, what's
going on here man?

757
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:21,261
I need the judge!
Get me the judge!

758
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:22,408
Drop your weapon now!

759
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:23,177
I need back-up! I need
back-up! You step back!

760
01:13:23,235 --> 01:13:24,556
No one fires! No one fires!

761
01:13:24,611 --> 01:13:25,866

I have evidence, okay?

762
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:26,982
Don't you say another word!

763
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:28,102
Rachel Shabangu's death-

764

He' got a bomb! (gun shot)

765

No one fires!

766
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:33,611
No one fires! No
one fires! Step back!

767
01:13:36,257 --> 01:13:39,565
USPS) MY
name is Rachel Shabangu. Today-

768
01:13:40,096 --> 01:13:41,964
(Detective Smith)
Cut the feed!

769
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:46,603
(tape) October 12th, 2011
I have been shot. In the event

770
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:50,697
that I don't survive this
will serve as testimony.

771
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:58,117
On September 17th 2011,
I uncovered...

772
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:04,383
...a sex trafficking ring
out of Johannesburg

773
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:12,254
and a trail that led back to
Chief of Police Ben Rose.

774
01:14:15,645 --> 01:14:18,374
(Reporter) Recovering in
Johannesburg's Central Hospital,

775
01:14:18,428 --> 01:14:21,290
the American tourist Michael
Woods was praised as a hero

776
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,004
by President Jacob Zuma,
who called him a courageous

777
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,888
defender of justice.
At his bed side,

778
01:14:26,938 --> 01:14:29,888
his ex-wife Angelica Moore
spoke with us earlier today.

779
01:14:29,947 --> 01:14:33,093
(Angelica) Yes, we've had
difficult times, but somehow

780
01:14:33,146 --> 01:14:36,903
I always knew that he's got it
in him. When it really mattered,

781
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:40,743
he pulled through and I will
always love him for that.

782
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:43,360
(Reporter) Rose and several
other high-ranking officers

783
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:46,431
and members of court were
arrested late last Tuesday

784
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:49,186
after a dramatic showdown
on Constitution Hill.

785
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,004
Shabangu's testimony and the
body of evidence found in

786
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:55,681
Justice James Mzuka's
possession ultimately led to-

787
01:14:55,735 --> 01:14:58,400
(continues in
several languages)
