1
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:32,369
- Richard. Hold it. Richard.
what's the matter?
- Okay. What happened?

2
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:36,081
I'm not selling these skis to my mother.
Please. A more neon sound.

3
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,375
- Mr Ron. I can't be waiting at the whim...
- Remember: to be free...

4
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,878
- Of your attorney.
- To soar like an eagle. To slip
the surly bonds of Earth.

5
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:44,673
- All right. Thank you.
- Right? That's the feel.

6
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,010
Here we go.

7
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,854
- The guys are tired. You know?
No. If they start losing...
- Well. If the guys are tired...

8
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,023
- Their chops... All right.
- It sounds that way in the ad. My dear.

9
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,193
- All right. They've never
let you down before. Jimmy.
- Cut!

10
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:08,029
- They've never let you down before.
- Uh. Richard. Listen.

11
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:12,742
We talked about this yesterday. And
l-I'm not getting the sound
that we. Uh. We're looking for.

12
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:16,746
Look, we're all tired, but, you know,
we might as well not be recording this...

13
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,207
unless we're gonna get
some punch. Now, maybe...

14
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,628
- My ears are clogged
or something, but, uh, it's a...
- Jimmy. We...

15
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,130
- We agreed on this yesterday.
- Say it. What? What? Tell me.

16
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,508
We've been playing a long time.
Okay? We need a lunch break.

17
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:32,804
Why don't we just get through
one track. One take...

18
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:35,139
and then give us
your notes. Okay?

19
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,934
- Okay, but, you know, I want... Hold it.
- We can fix it in the mix.

20
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,521
We can do it in the mix. But l-l-I want
to hear it in the performance too.

21
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:42,897
- How's it going?
- Just. Just surge.

22
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,483
- No. That's fine. I'll hold.
- I want a... Whee!

23
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,069
- Jimmy!
- Wha... Richard. Iook. At the risk...

24
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:53,449
It's not the fucking "Leonora Overture."
okay? It's a jingle.

25
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:57,285
Just let us get
through it once. Okay?

26
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,956
And then we'll have lunch
and then we'll have notes...

27
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,334
and then we'll fix it
in the mix. Okay?

28
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,589
Mom wants you
to come home right now!

29
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,509
She's waiting for you.

30
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,850
- Hi.
- Hi.

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,295
If she can stand it, I can.
Play it.

32
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,547
Yes, boss.

33
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,074
I think we should apologize
to Jimmy Schwartz tomorrow.

34
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,960
- Get ready. Pull.
- Sweet.

35
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,755
Pull.

36
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,470
Wish for something expensive.

37
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,229
- Mom.
- Mom.

38
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,857
- Okay.
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.

39
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,527
- All right. You take care.
Say hi to your mom.
- Nice party. Mrs Parker.

40
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,490
- You're welcome. You're welcome.
- Thanks for coming.
- Good night.

41
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:36,335
I guess we have
new neighbours. Eh?

42
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:27,427
Hey. You mind
if I run along with you?

43
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,846
No. Be my guest.
Richard Parker.

44
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,266
Oh. Hey. Eddy Otis.

45
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,394
Where's your beautiful
daughter today?

46
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,272
She's away at school.

47
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,774
She comes home
every other weekend.

48
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,610
- Uh. Whereabouts?
- It's a couple of hours from here.

49
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:47,613
It's a school for
musically-gifted children.

50
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,576
- Oh. You must be very proud.
- You could say.

51
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,290
Let me guess. You're in
something to do with the arts.

52
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:01,461
Maybe graphics.
maybe advertising.

53
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:04,172
No. Definitely advertising.

54
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:09,427
I'm a composer.
I write jingles for ads.

55
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,095
How'd you guess?

56
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:15,349
I used to sell insurance.
You get a feel for stuff like that.

57
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:19,269
What do you do?
I'm not even gonna guess.

58
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:23,315
- I give financial advice.
- Oh. Like what?

59
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:26,693
- Okay. Health clubs.
- Good. Huh?

60
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,571
- Lousy. Trust me.
- Oh.

61
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,448
Home security?

62
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,784
- Better?
- Oh. Much better.

63
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:37,454
He said they didn't know anyone. That they
were lonely. What could I say?

64
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,832
- Do you need these?
- Mmm.

65
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,794
And this.

66
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,755
I know how you feel about neighbours.
but it's only drinks.

67
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:50,175
- I don't drink.
- Since when?

68
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:53,512
I thought I was getting fat.

69
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:57,933
- You didn't notice.
- What? The getting fat
or the not drinking?

70
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,018
...Jamaica for the weekend
scuba diving.

71
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:03,146
Anyway. On our way to the airport
to come back and move houses...

72
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,234
we get caught up in a riot.
I swear to God. A riot.

73
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,862
It was fascinating. While I'm
so busy protecting my wife...

74
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:14,491
I don't notice them
stealing all the luggage.

75
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:18,286
Hence. The outfit when we arrived.
Everything else was packed.

76
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,622
- Have you never been in a riot. Priscilla?
- Sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:31,382
I'm Katherine.
but everybody calls me Kay.

78
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:35,678
Kay. This is Richard Parker
and his lovely wife Priscilla.

79
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:40,099
The way I look at life. The way I look at it
is this: money is like blood.

80
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:42,852
It's no big deal.
but if you want to live...

81
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,730
you've gotta have a lot of it pumping
through the system. For example...

82
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:49,358
most people will never know what it's like
to drive a boat at 100 miles an hour...

83
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,654
or go to Jamaica for the weekend or see
the Grand Canyon from a hot air balloon.

84
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:57,241
You see what I'm saying?
Without money...

85
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,368
you shrivel up.

86
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:04,498
So how do you explain all those
shrivelled-up. Rich people?

87
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:07,251
I'll tell you how.
Because those people...

88
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:11,213
they know how to make money. But
they don't know how to spend it.

89
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,551
Gettin' money's easy.

90
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,429
We have to talk.

91
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:20,930
- What would you invest in?
- Myself?

92
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:26,102
- Yeah.
- Drug and alcohol rehab centres.

93
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:31,566
I'm serious. It's the number one investment
op of the '90s. Priscilla. People are sheep.

94
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,944
You tell them they can't quit on their own
and suddenly everybody needs help.

95
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:37,697
I mean. The human mind.
What can you say?

96
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,783
You know what I'd do
if I had some serious money?

97
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,827
Misery

98
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,706
Come on. Help me out here.

99
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:04,808
Don't put no headstone
on my grave

100
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,815
All my life
I've been a slave

101
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:19,823
And I don't want
the world to know

102
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:27,538
Here lies the fool
who loves you so

103
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,297
Free from all this

104
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,758
Misery

105
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:21,091
Richard.

106
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,386
Come to bed.

107
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:35,063
You know. Me and Kay were saying.
you two have really got it made:

108
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:38,775
a nice home. A nice business.
a beautiful. Talented daughter...

109
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,486
a great marriage.

110
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:46,407
- I'm very lucky.
- What's the trick?

111
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:50,703
- To which?
- Marriage. How do you hold it
all together?

112
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:53,081
Trust. I guess.

113
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,918
Trust.

114
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,796
That's very interesting.

115
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,006
You know. I'm planning this trip down
to South Carolina this weekend.

116
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,009
I'm gonna fly down in my plane.
I got some property to check out.

117
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:07,887
- Why don't you and Priscilla come along?
- You have a plane?

118
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,223
Just a little twin engine Piper.

119
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,517
- Well. I'm sure we'd love to but...
- Look. If money's a problem...

120
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,769
- No. It's not really the money...
- Well. Good. Then we'll have fun.

121
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:19,232
- It's jus... Uh. Do you think we ought to...
- Now watch this.

122
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,943
Eddy. Careful!

123
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:25,029
Eddy!

124
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:22,169
Well. Let's say 5.000.

125
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:26,923
With 5.000. I'd put one in the bank.
one in bonds and play the stock market
with the rest.

126
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,345
The stock market?

127
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,846
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

128
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,266
How come you never pursued
a singing career?

129
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,394
There's a lot worse voices out there.

130
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,272
I guess Eddy got
all the self-confidence.

131
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:48,277
Maybe I could help you. That way
I'd get to play some blues. And. Uh...

132
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,156
You know. You...

133
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,540
I would take this wall out.

134
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,419
You know. Take it out. Make this
whole area screened in.

135
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,964
It would open it up a lot and then put
like blue shutters on it or something...

136
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,091
to give it a bit of life.
you know?

137
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:13,761
It could use it.

138
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:16,263
- What?
- Nothing. Go ahead.

139
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,599
- I'm being my usual self. Right?
- No. I like it.

140
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm gonna take over.

141
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,521
Oh. Never mind.
Come on.

142
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,150
I'm surprised Priscilla hasn't tried
to sell off some of her investments.

143
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,279
She was up to 15.000
last time I went over it.

144
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,906
Fifteen from five?

145
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,284
She has a good head on her shoulders.
What can I tell you?
Squeeze when you come up.

146
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:42,580
That five was a gift left by an uncle to go
towards a sailboat. Can't touch that.

147
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:45,792
How much do you owe?

148
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,461
It's not that much. Eddy.
Let's not talk about it.

149
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:52,382
No. Richard. I'm serious. Maybe
I can be of some help here.

150
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:55,051
You can't. Believe me.

151
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:59,264
Is there anything we can't
talk about? Now. Come on.

152
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:00,932
- You really wanna know?
- Yes.

153
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:05,270
Current debts. Credit cards.
bank loans. About 25.000.

154
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:10,859
Is that all? I can get
you that in an afternoon.

155
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,278
How?

156
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:17,032
Leave it to me. Bubbi.
Three to six weeks. Okay?

157
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,200
- What-What kind of interest
are we talking about?
- No kind of interest.

158
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:23,830
I don't loan money
to my friends. It's a gift.

159
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:28,835
Our greatest glory. Dicky boy. Is not in
never falling but in rising every time we fall.

160
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:32,005
Oh! Do you see? Now you left yourself
open for that one. You deserved it.

161
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:35,467
Now. Come on. Come on. That's it.
Come on. That's right. Come on.

162
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,054
Come on. That's it. That's it.
That's it. Hit mine. That's it. Come on.

163
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,305
Come on. Keep it in. Keep it in.
All right. Now. Keep it...

164
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,026
Oh. My God!

165
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,368
- Oh. My God. Eddy.
- Call an ambulance.
- Oh. Richard.

166
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,829
- Thank you. Dr Pettering.
- Talk to you tomorrow.

167
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,335
- You know how to reach us.
- Call if you need anything.

168
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,879
I will. Thanks a lot.

169
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,048
Take care.

170
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:19,593
- Oh. My God.
- Poor guy. I feel terrible.

171
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,595
He didn't look as bad as I thought.
You know. But he...

172
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,764
Didn't he say he was coming
to take us out to dinner?

173
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,352
- Now.
- Okay. Everybody. Five minutes.

174
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,270
- Okay.
- Priscilla?

175
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:34,233
- Baby. I fudged.
- Could you come here and help me?

176
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,902
Sure. Sure.
What is it?

177
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:40,739
l-I'd like to get up. I've been lying
in the same position too long.

178
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,408
Okay. Okay. Here.
You grab on to me.

179
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:47,161
- Okay. Be careful. Please.
- I will. Dear. I will. Now. On three. Okay?

180
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:50,415
- Okay. Wait.
- Ready? One. Two...

181
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:52,500
- Up we go.
- Wait. Slow.

182
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,752
Go slow.

183
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:57,088
- Are you all right? There you go.
- Yeah.

184
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,424
- There you go! Okay. Richard.
- Ow! Ow!

185
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:03,553
- Ow! Don't touch me. Don't.
- Richard.

186
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:06,097
Just give me a little air.

187
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,851
I can't move.

188
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:13,980
I can't move.

189
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,360
Or can I?

190
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,919
- Oh!
- Ah.

191
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:41,674
Oh. That's-that's
much better. Well...

192
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:46,262
Well. What's this?

193
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:49,139
Your insurance company.

194
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:52,434
Neck and back
scares the shit out of them.

195
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:58,190
I'm in the business. Pal. It was easy.
I got this pet doctor. It was nothing.

196
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:03,904
Oh. I'm gonna keep five
if that's okay with you guys.

197
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:07,324
Yes. Priscilla.

198
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,326
It's true.

199
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,329
It-It was a scam.
And I'm...

200
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,248
I'm terribly. Terribly sorry.

201
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,960
You broke the law. Eddy.

202
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,337
For us?

203
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,090
What are friends for?

204
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,635
Oh. I don't think we can
accept this. We appreciate it.

205
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:31,348
- We really do.
- I love this woman.
"I don't think we can accept it"?

206
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,101
It's not that we don't
need the money.

207
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:38,063
Priscilla. Please. Don't insult me.

208
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:41,275
I did this for you.
For you.

209
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,028
Now. Come on.

210
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,490
I've been wearing
that neck brace for weeks.

211
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:51,284
What do you say?

212
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,040
I don't know what to say.

213
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,211
But thanks.

214
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,887
Can't sleep?

215
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,221
No.

216
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,102
You think too much.

217
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,523
What about you?

218
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:15,533
Is Priscilla asleep?

219
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,454
What about Eddy?

220
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:22,290
No.

221
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:27,379
He's at the Watkins'. You know.
the people that own the cabins.

222
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:36,346
Probably trying to buy the place.

223
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,767
Always looking for a deal.

224
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:52,404
How long you been married?
Thirteen?

225
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,073
Fourteen years.

226
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:05,457
Have you been faithful
all those years?

227
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:11,755
Yeah.
What about you?

228
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:18,429
I guess I'm kind of
old-fashioned that way.

229
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:30,858
I guess we both are. Huh?

230
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,360
- Baby, yeah
- Lori?

231
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:35,571
- Hi. Honey. It's Mom.
- I wanna jump in the middle

232
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:37,698
- Yeah. We're in a bar.
- And wallow around

233
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,950
- And keep on drinkin'till
I feel like I'm drowned
- No. It's very. Very nice.

234
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,536
- Honey. We decided to stay
another night. All right?
- I want a piece of the party

235
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,457
- So if you need anything...
- And party till I see the light

236
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,252
- Go on. Go on.
- I want a piece of the party

237
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:54,465
- And party till I see the light
- I'm gonna talk to the guy.
and you're gonna do it.

238
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,319
Give 'em hell.

239
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:30,041
As I reach out to you

240
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:35,338
Like a child would do

241
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:41,970
Darling, don't let me down

242
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:49,811
I love you so

243
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:53,273
And I guess you know

244
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:57,986
That I'm too far gone

245
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,863
To turn around

246
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,825
You wanna fuck my wife.
don't you?

247
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:09,288
- If I give you my heart
- Oh. Don't look so scared. Richard.
It's no big deal.

248
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,040
- Most guys want to fuck my wife.
- Please don't telephone

249
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,293
I've kind of gotten
used to the idea.

250
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:18,964
- Don't treat me like dirt on the ground
- As it happens...

251
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:22,759
I'm not entirely immune
to that kind of thought myself.

252
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:27,222
Give me a break

253
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:30,267
- For heaven's sake
- I mean. Nobody wants to blow
their marriage. God forbid.

254
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,313
- But God.
- 'Cause I'm too far gone

255
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:39,693
- For just one night.
- To turn around

256
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,156
- Wouldn't that be sweet?
- I'm too far gone

257
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:49,328
- You are insane. Eddy. Fucking insane.
- For backing up now

258
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:54,291
- I'm too far gone
- And so safe.

259
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:57,544
- To stop
- Let me ask you something.

260
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:01,798
- I'm flying high
- You ever wake up in
the middle of the night and...

261
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:05,594
- Like a bird up in the sky
- You know. Just sort of do it?

262
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:09,055
- Like. Half asleep?
- Darling

263
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:13,225
- Yeah. Sure.
- Don't let me down

264
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,687
I wonder what
would happen if...

265
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:20,775
- You and I got up in the middle
of the night. Went next door...
- Don't make it you

266
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:25,988
- And crept into the other man's bedroom?
- Whatever you do

267
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:29,951
- Oh, don't turn my life
- Would they know the difference?

268
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:33,371
Upside down

269
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,039
I think so.

270
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:39,585
- I need you so
- And would they mind? Richard.
take a look.

271
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,214
- And I guess you know
- They want exactly what we want.

272
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:47,593
- That I'm too far gone
- In the heat of the moment. They'll love it.

273
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:51,472
To turn around

274
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:56,269
- Hey. It's all set.
- I'm too far gone

275
00:24:58,187 --> 00:25:01,357
To turn around

276
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:06,237
I'll bet you a thousand dollars
we could pull it off.

277
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,198
- Eddy. Come on. Enough with this.
- Enough? Enough?

278
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:12,742
You say "enough" real quick.
don't you? Are you...

279
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:16,663
Wait. Wait. Are you sure?
Let me tell you something.

280
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:20,083
I can't remember when I've liked a guy
as much as I like you.
but the truth of the matter is...

281
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:25,255
you're a wimp. You think you can
be alive without taking risks.

282
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,715
- There's a lot of different ways...
- No. That... You do.

283
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:28,758
That's why you end up living
this 50% existence...

284
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:32,929
when there's 100% waiting
out there to be had.

285
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:35,932
You're full of fear.
Your life is choked.

286
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,643
You-You write jingles when
you'd rather be doing albums.

287
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:41,021
You do it for money.
but you're always in debt.

288
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:46,109
You wanna make love to my wife.
but you're afraid you'll get caught.

289
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:49,237
This is how you die.
step by step...

290
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:52,365
these little things
you deny yourself...

291
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:55,285
this cowardice.

292
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:57,829
- It's not that.
- No. That is what it is. Who care...

293
00:25:57,912 --> 00:26:01,041
Who cares if we get caught?
Big deal.

294
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:06,755
Aw. Forget it. You've lost your juice.
It's no big deal. It's your life.

295
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:11,259
Make a fist.
Too tight?

296
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:14,762
You really amaze me Richard.
you know. Just when things start
getting interesting around here...

297
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:18,515
you go cautious on me. Climb
back into your little shell.

298
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,186
And what about Priscilla? Hasn't she
told you how much more alive she feels?

299
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,148
Eddy. Goddam it.
That's enough. Okay?

300
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,818
The subject is closed.
It's not gonna happen.

301
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,571
I hope we can stay friends.

302
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:37,743
I don't know. You make me feel bad.
You're so judgmental.

303
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,996
I'm not judgmental.
We're just different. Okay?

304
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,165
- You're you and I'm me.
- Oh. That is absolutely right!

305
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,710
I got balls and you don't. I'm a giver
and you're a taker. That's clear.

306
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:49,838
Well. In this particular case. It's a hell of
a lot easier for you to give than for me. Pal.

307
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:53,425
I happen to sleep
with my wife.

308
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:00,516
Boy. When you stick it in...

309
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:13,779
Fun, fun in the sun

310
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,790
Fun in the sun

311
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,376
Fun in the sun

312
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,503
Fun in the sun

313
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:38,803
- Sounds good.
- Fun, fun in the sun

314
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,934
Fun in the sun

315
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:05,371
When you deem me worthy...

316
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:09,083
I'd like to know what happened
between you and Eddy.

317
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:01,843
Oh. I got it.

318
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:07,057
All right. Uh. A little
to the left. I think.

319
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah. Perfect!

320
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:15,983
Is that a beautiful tree
or is that a beautiful tree?

321
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:21,363
- Think this tree is big enough?
- It's huge.

322
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:23,781
- What are we gonna sing?
- It's beautiful.

323
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:29,370
Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh

324
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:33,374
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way, ha-ha-ha

325
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:37,169
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright

326
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:40,298
What fun it is to ride and
sing a sleighing song tonight

327
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,091
- Richard. Will you please
tell me what happened...
- Jingle bells, Jingle bells

328
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:45,011
- Between you and Eddy?
- Jingle all the way

329
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:48,848
Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh, hey

330
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:52,476
- Is it about Kay?
- Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way

331
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,648
- Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
- Did you sleep with her?

332
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,900
No.

333
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:05,781
Priscilla. Please.

334
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:09,869
Don't be jealous.
There's nothing to be jealous of.

335
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:14,290
I'm not jealous.

336
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:18,836
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

337
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,382
- Remember Christ our Saviour
was born on Christmas day
- It's just that...

338
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:25,259
To save us all
from Satan's power

339
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,552
Something went missing
from this marriage...

340
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:32,182
- Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
- And for a while it...

341
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:37,312
- Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
- Seemed to come back again.

342
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:41,566
- From God our Heavenly Father
a blessed angel came
- Now...

343
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,277
- And unto certain shepherds
- We never should have taken that money.

344
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:46,154
Brought tidings to the same

345
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:50,116
How that in Bethlehem was born
the Son of God by name

346
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,954
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

347
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:59,125
- We should never have taken that money?
- Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

348
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:04,005
Now you say something? Now you're
gonna make your moral judgement.

349
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:08,051
- It's cold tonight. Don't you think?
- Is that what this is all about?

350
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:14,641
Eddy lacks your moral fibre?
What about gratitude. Richard?

351
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,935
- On the first day of Christmas
my true love gave to me
- He risked his reputation.

352
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:20,689
- He risked his life for us!
- A partridge in a pear tree

353
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:23,608
- On the second day of Christmas
my true love gave to me
- No. He may not always...

354
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,485
- Play by the rules.
- Two turtle doves

355
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:29,114
- But at least he's in the game.
- And a partridge in a pear tree

356
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:30,990
- On the third day of Christmas
- When was the last time you took a risk?

357
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,616
My true love gave to me

358
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,160
Three French hens
Two turtle doves

359
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:38,580
And a partridge
in a pear tree

360
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:42,293
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

361
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,503
Four calling birds
Three French hens

362
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:48,924
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

363
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:52,553
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

364
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:57,016
Five golden rings

365
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:59,435
Four calling birds
Three French hens

366
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:04,023
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

367
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:07,526
On the sixth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

368
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,906
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings

369
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,326
Four calling birds
Three French hens

370
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:19,580
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

371
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:23,208
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

372
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,586
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying

373
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:29,590
Five golden rings

374
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,884
Four calling birds
Three French hens

375
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:36,471
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

376
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,099
On the eighth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

377
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:42,352
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming

378
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:47,565
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings

379
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,901
Four calling birds
Three French hens

380
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:54,447
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

381
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,951
On the ninth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me

382
00:32:58,034 --> 00:33:00,203
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking

383
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:02,413
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying

384
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:06,918
Five golden rings

385
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,212
Four calling birds
Three French hens

386
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:13,800
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

387
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,928
- Whoa!
- Holy cow!

388
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:19,055
It's out of the park!

389
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,266
- Swing. Whoa!
- Oh!

390
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:24,560
Come on. Richard. I know I'm...
I'm a tough act to follow.

391
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,145
It's the bat.
It must be the bat.

392
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:27,772
- It's all right.
- It's the bat.

393
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,857
- It's the bat.
- Go. Go. Go!

394
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:35,446
- Get her!
- No!

395
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,156
No!

396
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,203
- No!
- Hey. Iook at them.

397
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:58,427
I would like
to propose a toast.

398
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,557
To neighbours...

399
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:07,561
and friends.

400
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,128
Heaven

401
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm in heaven

402
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:18,676
And my heart beats so

403
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:22,680
That I can hardly speak

404
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:25,516
And I seem to find

405
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,603
The happiness I seek

406
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,994
- You okay?
- Fine.

407
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,517
There's coffee.

408
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:15,815
Priscilla...

409
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,278
The sports.

410
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:32,040
I love you.

411
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,713
I love you.

412
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:04,738
You kids get out of the street.

413
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,333
- What happened?
- You can't go in.

414
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,503
- I'm their best friend.
- You can't go in! Hey!

415
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:28,304
You! You.

416
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,520
Samples taken from the victim's
body prove you had sex with her
within a half-hour of her death.

417
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:39,982
Otis claims you had a "obsessive
fixation" on his wife.

418
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:43,611
And the murder weapon
has your prints on it.

419
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,614
- We played softball that afternoon.
- Yes.

420
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:50,200
Meanwhile. Otis says that your story
about crossing back and forth...

421
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:52,953
during the night. Etcetera.
is nonsense.

422
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,165
And says that immediately
after dinner. Around 9.00 p. M...

423
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:59,501
he departed for Appalachia Lake.
leaving his wife behind.

424
00:42:59,585 --> 00:43:02,796
Now that's a five-hour trip. Luke Watkins
of Watkins Fishing Lodge...

425
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,174
says Otis woke him
at 2.00 a.m. for the keys.

426
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:10,053
- It's a lie.
- Now the time of death has been
set between 1.00 and 3.00 a.m.

427
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:13,389
Now if Otis's story is true. The closest
he could have been to his wife...

428
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:17,560
at the time she was killed was
somewhere in the middle of the
Chattahoochee National Forest.

429
00:43:17,644 --> 00:43:20,063
I'm telling you. It's a lie.

430
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,565
If I were you. I'd consider
some kind of plea.

431
00:43:22,649 --> 00:43:25,610
Otherwise. Unless
we can break Eddy's alibi...

432
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:27,904
you could be in deep. Deep shit.

433
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:30,740
Kneel down.

434
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:37,497
Hands behind your head. Please.

435
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,672
Okay.

436
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:15,784
Are they treating you okay?

437
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,372
Don't worry about me.
How's Lori?

438
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,879
What do I tell her?

439
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:32,301
Tell her the truth.

440
00:44:32,384 --> 00:44:35,137
Tell her the truth.

441
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:40,726
This is a nightmare.

442
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:45,939
You have to help me understand this.
Richard. Please. Help me.

443
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,233
Please.

444
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:50,569
I thought it was
what everyone wanted.

445
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:54,865
It seems like everyone was
pushing me to do it. Even you.

446
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:02,247
Who was pushing you
to kill her?

447
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,003
Are you insane?

448
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:10,172
Priscilla. I didn't kill her.

449
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:12,174
Richard. You just said you...

450
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:15,134
Mrs Parker. To the best
of your knowledge...

451
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:17,678
did any other person
other than your husband...

452
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:20,139
enter your room
the night of the murder?

453
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:24,060
No. No. Of course not.

454
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:27,897
That was your story. Richard?

455
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,733
I thought that was something
the papers made up.

456
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:36,322
You please. You please think
of some other defence. Please!

457
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:39,867
How could this have happened? How could
you have done this to Lori. Richard?

458
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:43,496
How could you have done this
to our- Our family?

459
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,792
Richard! Oh. God!

460
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,563
Everyone told me
not to come here today...

461
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:12,233
but I couldn't let
anyone else do this for me.

462
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:17,404
I suppose I never was
as strong as I pretended.

463
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:20,448
And I don't have the strength...

464
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:23,660
to be both the good wife...

465
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,121
and the good mother.

466
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:30,917
So I'm going to be
the good mother.

467
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:35,005
I want to take Lori
away from all of this.

468
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,509
I want my name back.

469
00:46:43,054 --> 00:46:45,765
I want a divorce.

470
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:51,021
Lori is in hell. Richard.

471
00:46:52,063 --> 00:46:55,317
And I can't save you both.

472
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,460
What this does is define
the financial terms of the divorce...

473
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:16,421
to the satisfaction
of the bondsman.

474
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,964
Along with your car
and musical instruments...

475
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:22,801
this pays my initial fee
and secures the bond.

476
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:27,139
She's being very generous.
acting so fast.

477
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:33,854
Well. You have 24 hours to remove
whatever personal effects you want
from the house.

478
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:36,315
The rest will be sold at auction
to pay for your defence.

479
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:39,818
And don't get into any trouble.

480
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,245
Oh. Jesus.

481
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,373
Who the hell are you?

482
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:39,127
My name is David Duttonville.

483
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,130
I'm a private investigator.

484
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,425
I. Um...

485
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,305
I'm gonna sit down now.

486
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:54,684
You scared me.

487
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:00,064
Door was open. I used to live
next door. I was just...

488
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:02,901
Yes. I know who you are.

489
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:05,528
I thought you were
still in the. Uh...

490
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:08,323
- I made bail.
- Great.

491
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,663
My company.
Duttonville Research...

492
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,916
it's been hired
by three insurance companies...

493
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:22,045
to investigate a total
$ 1.5 million double indemnity claim...

494
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,006
by Eddy Otis
on his wife. Kay Otis.

495
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,801
In fact. We were hopin' that
you might be able to help us.

496
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:32,596
$ 1.5 million?

497
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:37,142
Yes. That's the point.

498
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:40,687
It is rather a lot to take out
on a would-be lounge singer...

499
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:44,608
who never earned a cent
in her entire life.

500
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,944
However. There's
no law against it.

501
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:50,489
She had a policy on him
in the same amount.

502
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:54,660
Eddy's explanation is...

503
00:49:54,743 --> 00:49:57,496
that they loved
each other so much...

504
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:00,165
he figured if
either of them got killed...

505
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:03,210
they'd need
a lot of compensation.

506
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:07,464
It's a funny attitude.

507
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:11,718
The world is a funny place.

508
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,474
So he went back in there...

509
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,644
and he beat her to death...

510
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,854
for money.

511
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,568
Just as simple as that.

512
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:31,904
Isn't that amazing?

513
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,658
I even think he liked her.

514
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:40,121
You're saying
he killed Kay Otis?

515
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,790
Of course he killed her.

516
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,086
But what a set-up.

517
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:52,758
The whole thing
just so he could...

518
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,682
$ 1.5 million.

519
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,729
I checked his alibi.
It's gonna hold.

520
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,193
What about the people at the lodge?
I wonder how much he paid them.

521
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,321
Me too.

522
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,326
But who is Eddy?
Where'd he come from?

523
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:22,371
I was hoping you knew.

524
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:25,625
He told me he was
a financial advisor.

525
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,877
Great.

526
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,296
Now I know.

527
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:35,508
I'm on this for a week.

528
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,971
There's a limit to what
one can do in a week.

529
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,351
I need something solid.

530
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,562
You got anything?

531
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:51,399
Just what I already
told them.

532
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,943
The police know about
the insurance. I suppose?

533
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:59,074
They're not interested. I think
they feel comfortable with you.

534
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,994
- Comfortable?
- You know what I mean.

535
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,789
They got a good case.

536
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,583
Look. You got my card.

537
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,378
You think of anything.
you give me a call.

538
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,130
Oh. And by the way.
in case you're interested...

539
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:18,426
when I interviewed Otis.
he was with your spouse.

540
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,847
The grieving widower
comforting the lonely wife.

541
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:26,017
I'm gonna get going.

542
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,353
Goodbye.

543
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,347
I'm Richard Parker.
Why are you doing this to me?

544
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:09,143
- Who is it?
- Call the police.

545
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:12,021
Get my gun.
then call the police.

546
00:53:12,104 --> 00:53:14,690
I've lost my wife...

547
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:18,319
my child. My home.

548
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:24,366
I'm facing a death sentence
or life imprisonment.

549
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,410
Call the police.

550
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:29,914
How do you sleep at night?

551
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:33,959
Damn it. Woman.
call the police.

552
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:40,465
Didn't he pay you
enough to kill me?

553
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:02,195
Richard, uh,
this is George Gordon.

554
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:06,616
I'm afraid we failed in getting
a further postponement of the trial.

555
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,493
The trial will be
in three weeks.

556
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:12,789
I do have to say I would advise
you to reconsider your plea.

557
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:14,791
Thank you.

558
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:35,520
All my life
I've been a slave

559
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:43,026
Just put me down
and let me be

560
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:49,616
Free from all

561
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:55,872
This misery

562
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,712
Mmm, that was Olivia Kamen with
'Put No Headstone On My Grave..."

563
00:55:01,795 --> 00:55:04,548
a song made famous
by Little Esther Phillips...

564
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:08,260
at The Blues Connection here
in Five Points, Atlanta. Next...

565
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:48,925
There you go.

566
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:08,945
Kay?

567
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:17,078
Sorry.

568
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:19,288
What happened
to the contest?

569
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:21,499
Contest?

570
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:24,794
There was a blues contest
on the radio.

571
00:56:24,877 --> 00:56:27,964
- I was just listening to it.
- Oh. That was last week.

572
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:30,341
You must have been
listening to a repeat.

573
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:37,056
There was a singer.
Olivia Kamen?

574
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:39,809
Oh. She won. But when we
went out lookin' for her...

575
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:43,646
to give her the prize. She lit out.
Didn't leave an address or nothin'.

576
00:56:46,732 --> 00:56:49,484
- What does she look like?
- What does she look like?

577
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:51,987
Ooh. She looked good!

578
00:57:34,404 --> 00:57:36,364
- All right!
- Yeah!

579
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:38,366
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

580
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:42,120
And thanks to our friend that
we haven't seen in a long time.

581
00:57:42,203 --> 00:57:44,873
- Tip your bartenders and waitresses.
- They're not bad.

582
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:48,209
And remember. We love you.
We thank you for loving the music.

583
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:52,379
Drive safe on your way home.
Good night.

584
00:57:52,463 --> 00:57:58,385
- Who loves you so, mm-hmm
- That's her voice.

585
00:57:58,469 --> 00:58:00,804
I'd know it if she was
singing underwater.

586
00:58:00,888 --> 00:58:03,015
So who got killed
that night?

587
00:58:03,098 --> 00:58:05,309
I don't know.

588
00:58:05,392 --> 00:58:08,520
We gotta exhume the body
and get a closer look.

589
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:12,233
Can't exhume the body. It was cremated.
I checked on the way over.

590
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:17,154
Besides. Otis is not the only
one who identified the body.

591
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:22,243
- Someone else?
- A doctor.

592
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:26,413
- A doctor?
- Yeah.

593
00:58:26,497 --> 00:58:29,917
I'll bet you $ 1.000 if you
call my insurance company...

594
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,003
you will see that same doctor's
name on an insurance claim...

595
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,258
that Eddy made when he faked
an accident involving my car.

596
00:58:37,341 --> 00:58:40,761
You're suggesting that Otis...

597
00:58:40,844 --> 00:58:44,848
- Went out and hired someone...
- Probably.

598
00:58:44,932 --> 00:58:49,103
who resembled Kay. So you
could make love to her...

599
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:54,316
- And he could then beat her to death.
- Yes.

600
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:59,404
I'll think about it.

601
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:05,410
From all the trouble
you've caused me

602
00:59:05,493 --> 00:59:07,453
Okay. Okay.
she's got a nice voice.

603
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:10,456
- Turn it off before I break down and cry.
- Don't...

604
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,876
- Do you have any other recordings?
- Like what?

605
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,255
Recordings like she made
before she died.

606
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:20,216
I told you. She didn't record
anything. That's my point.

607
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,221
No. That's my point.
We have no comparison.

608
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:27,640
A broad in some club in
Five Points sounds like...

609
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:30,268
some broad who got
snuffed in Huntcliffe...

610
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:33,897
according to you.
the accused snuffer.

611
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,650
I go into court with a thing like that.
they'll laugh in my face.

612
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:40,820
And the initials KO.
OK. Olivia Kamen...

613
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:45,074
Oh. Please. Please.
Mr Parker. I'm an old man.

614
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:47,577
Does it fall to me at this time
of life to have to explain...

615
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,998
the fundamental principles of the judicial
system to a man of your intelligence?

616
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:56,085
Evidence. Dear boy.
Evidence.

617
00:59:56,169 --> 01:00:00,214
So find it. You old bastard.
Find it.

618
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,343
Help me up.

619
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,681
- Hi. Dad. Bye. Dad.
- Say. Don't slam the door.

620
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:15,062
- No fighting. Junior. I mean it.
- Mama.

621
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:19,399
- You called me.
- Yeah. I thought you'd call me back.

622
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:22,069
l-I normally don't do
business here at my home.

623
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:25,239
- What'd you find out?
- Daddy's coming now.
I know he promised.

624
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:29,493
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Ready or not. Here I come.

625
01:00:29,576 --> 01:00:32,579
- No. No. No. No. You can't. You cheated.
- There's not a trace so far.

626
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:36,083
But there was a woman disappeared that
night. Similar appearance and everything.

627
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,919
Hi. Honey. Uh. The boys
are waiting for you to play basketball.

628
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:43,757
Oh. This is. Uh. Richard Parker.
that insurance case...

629
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,928
- Hello. Richard. Mm-hmm.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

630
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:51,098
- Uh. We'll be finished here in a minute.
- I'm gonna start dinner.

631
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,100
Sorry to intrude.

632
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:58,021
But I did find the doctor who
signed that death certificate.

633
01:00:58,105 --> 01:01:00,440
Name's. Uh. Dr Pettering.

634
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:03,401
He also signed Eddy's injury claim.

635
01:01:03,484 --> 01:01:07,113
Seems he was a promising
young doctor in Chicago...

636
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,782
till he got greedy
and blew himself up.

637
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:12,201
He's got a scar down
one side of his face.

638
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:16,205
Yeah. Otherwise
he's real good-lookin'.

639
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:18,624
A month after the murder...

640
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,294
he and Eddy went
into partnership.

641
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:25,631
They call it a residential treatment centre
for addictive disorders.

642
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,388
There is a third partner.

643
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:34,682
A third partner.

644
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:38,853
Partner in both senses of the word.
Do you catch my drift?

645
01:01:41,522 --> 01:01:44,609
Your wife.

646
01:01:44,692 --> 01:01:46,819
Priscilla.

647
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:55,328
If Eddy catches you
prowling around his property...

648
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:59,665
he will have
your bail revoked.

649
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,668
He's got my wife and child.

650
01:02:05,587 --> 01:02:08,173
Do you think... Do any of you feel
qualified to deal with him...

651
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:10,842
or do we actually bring somebody
else in? Is that a possibility?

652
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:14,012
Or is it pretty much
a moot point?

653
01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:54,361
- Hello.
- I got your message.

654
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:56,155
Didn't I tell you not to go
to Charleston, Richard?

655
01:03:56,238 --> 01:04:01,493
Why didn't he kill the real Kay?
It would have been a lot easier.

656
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:04,496
Maybe they were partners in it.
Maybe he liked her too much.

657
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:09,752
- But I don't...
- Maybe they're still in touch.

658
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:15,256
- It's a possibility, I guess.
- It's my last possibility.

659
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:22,222
- Hey. Sam. How are ya?
- Oh. I'm just fine.

660
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:36,611
Honey. Don't squeeze
the bread like that.

661
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:51,209
These are so special.

662
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:55,630
Mom. Please.
I really want that.

663
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:20,153
- Hello. Hi. Eddy.
- Priscilla, hi.

664
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:22,656
- Did you get the samples?
- Yeah. I got them. I'm on my way.

665
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:26,159
- Want to go out to dinner tonight?
- No. I think we should stay in.

666
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:29,079
Lori goes back in a few days and. Uh.
she seems a bit upset lately.

667
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:32,916
So it'd be great if we could. Uh. You know.
spend the night in the house.

668
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,168
- All right. I'll see you in a little while.
- Love you.

669
01:05:35,252 --> 01:05:37,170
Okay. Bye-bye.

670
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:45,012
Rape!
Richard! Go away!

671
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:47,014
- Leave me alone. Please!
- Priscilla!

672
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:49,349
- No!
- Listen to me!

673
01:05:49,433 --> 01:05:53,186
Don't...
Don't hurt me. Please!

674
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:56,023
I'm not gonna hurt you.

675
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:03,530
- L...
- I want you to play this for Eddy.

676
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,702
It's Kay. She's alive.

677
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:14,374
It was another one
of Eddy's scams.

678
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:17,377
This one was for
a million and a half.

679
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:21,464
Oh. Richard. Oh.

680
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:25,635
Just play the tape...

681
01:06:25,718 --> 01:06:29,555
for Eddy tonight.

682
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:35,478
- May I go now?
- You'll play it?

683
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:37,730
I'll play the tape.

684
01:06:48,532 --> 01:06:50,576
How's Lori?

685
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:55,248
Can I see her?

686
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:59,752
Please? Please!
Priscilla?

687
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:08,553
Where are you staying?

688
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:11,264
The Carolina Motel.

689
01:07:11,347 --> 01:07:14,183
For how long?

690
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:16,435
That depends.

691
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,108
Be careful.

692
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:33,618
Don't put no headstone
on my grave

693
01:07:35,203 --> 01:07:41,167
All my life
I've been a slave

694
01:07:55,557 --> 01:08:02,314
Now tell my mother
not to cry

695
01:08:03,857 --> 01:08:10,363
I'll see her
in the by-and-by

696
01:08:12,282 --> 01:08:18,788
Tell her that
I'm finally free

697
01:08:20,332 --> 01:08:26,879
From all the trouble
you've caused me

698
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:31,300
Don't put no headstone

699
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:35,221
On my grave

700
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:43,062
All my life
I've been a slave

701
01:08:45,147 --> 01:08:50,903
Just put me down
and let me be

702
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:57,910
Free from all

703
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:04,917
This misery

704
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,260
I'm sorry.

705
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,100
That sounded
so much like Kay.

706
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:27,648
It really got to me.

707
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:34,445
Where did you find that?

708
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:37,740
I got it in the mail.

709
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,876
It's from Richard.

710
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:51,212
I got it in the mail.

711
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:54,465
Oh. That poor. Sick bastard.

712
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:00,555
What's he trying
to do to us?

713
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,309
He finds some girl
that sounds like Kay.

714
01:10:04,392 --> 01:10:06,978
He records it
and sends it here.

715
01:10:08,313 --> 01:10:11,900
You think you've
started a life...

716
01:10:11,983 --> 01:10:16,279
and you hear something like this
and it just brings it all back!

717
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:23,494
I'm sorry.

718
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:38,734
- You got anything?
- Got. Uh. Three Memphis.

719
01:11:38,818 --> 01:11:43,239
- I got a Memphis. Savannahs.
- Savannah here.

720
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:47,910
- Atlantic City. New York. Chicago.
- Another Savannah.

721
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:52,248
Savannah. Savannah. Savannah.
Four Savannahs.

722
01:11:52,331 --> 01:11:55,418
The same day that Eddy
heard the tape. Same number.

723
01:11:55,501 --> 01:12:00,923
- Great. Let's give it a call.
- 912-555-3722.

724
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:05,761
- Here. Give it a try.
- No. You do it. You do it.

725
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:07,930
- Just ask for Olivia Kamen.
- Scoville Hotel.

726
01:12:08,014 --> 01:12:10,933
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello. Scoville Hotel.

727
01:12:11,017 --> 01:12:13,811
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Scoville Hotel.

728
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:17,607
Uh. Can you give me
Olivia Kamen's room?

729
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:22,194
- Who?
- That's K-a-m-e-n.

730
01:12:22,278 --> 01:12:25,448
One moment.

731
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:35,291
- What?
- They're ringing her room.

732
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:40,378
She's there.

733
01:13:16,915 --> 01:13:21,086
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for an Olivia Kamen.

734
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:24,756
- She's down at the Dominion Cafe.
- Where's that?

735
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:28,760
It's a joint on
East Broad and Bay.

736
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:32,681
- Could you walk it from here?
- No. But you could.

737
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:59,206
Once my cup
was overflowing

738
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:07,047
And I gave
nothin'in return

739
01:14:11,093 --> 01:14:16,223
Now I can't
begin to tell you

740
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:20,978
What a lesson

741
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:24,732
What a lesson
I learned

742
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:32,239
Looking back

743
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:35,075
Over my deeds

744
01:14:37,036 --> 01:14:40,664
I can see signs

745
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:44,834
A wise man heeds

746
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:49,881
But I know

747
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:51,925
Yes, I know

748
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:59,182
I'll never
make that same

749
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:02,769
Mistake again

750
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:11,653
But I know

751
01:15:11,736 --> 01:15:16,199
Yes, I know

752
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:20,787
I'll never
make that same

753
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:26,876
Mistake again

754
01:15:36,803 --> 01:15:38,805
You can't go in there.

755
01:15:40,932 --> 01:15:45,228
Where is she?
Olivia Kamen? Where is she?

756
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:49,648
- She's gone.
- Olivia Kamen. Which room?

757
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:58,156
All the way to the top
on the roof.

758
01:17:12,772 --> 01:17:16,150
- I didn't know! I swear...
- Don't lie to me!

759
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,698
I swear. That night
after we played baseball...

760
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:25,493
he told me to go up to the lake
to Watkins Lodge...

761
01:17:25,576 --> 01:17:28,663
and stay out of sight.

762
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:32,250
You drove the Mercedes
with the cigarette boat.

763
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:37,838
The next morning.
he shows up on his motorbike.

764
01:17:37,922 --> 01:17:40,841
We go out on the lake...

765
01:17:40,925 --> 01:17:44,804
and he tells me everything.

766
01:17:46,222 --> 01:17:49,725
And then he said
if I told anyone...

767
01:17:49,809 --> 01:17:52,937
he'd say I'd known all along.

768
01:17:55,313 --> 01:18:01,111
Then I went to Canada.
and I tried to forget...

769
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:06,741
what I did to you.

770
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,309
Yes?

771
01:18:36,396 --> 01:18:38,481
There's a David Duttonville
downstairs.

772
01:18:38,565 --> 01:18:41,985
He... He wants
to see you alone.

773
01:20:41,352 --> 01:20:43,605
- Hi.
- Hi.

774
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:50,361
How was Atlanta?

775
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,780
I missed you.

776
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:01,581
Looks like somebody in your
family's been travelling.

777
01:21:01,664 --> 01:21:06,835
One. Two. Three.
four shirts. One suit.

778
01:21:06,919 --> 01:21:09,129
Tuesday?

779
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:39,886
And you're sure
it was Richard?

780
01:22:39,969 --> 01:22:43,347
The deskman said he saw him
go upstairs with Miss Kamen.

781
01:22:43,431 --> 01:22:45,850
There were fingerprints
all over the place.

782
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:49,604
The Savannah police think that by now
there's a good chance
he may have left Savannah.

783
01:22:49,687 --> 01:22:52,607
- Do you want us to put
some men up by the house?
- No. I have a 24-hour guard.

784
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:56,777
- We have very tight security.
- Do you mind if we just
check around your property...

785
01:22:56,861 --> 01:22:59,739
- To make sure you're adequately
protected?
- No. I'd appreciate that.

786
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:35,815
- Eddy? Before you come up...
- Yeah?

787
01:23:35,899 --> 01:23:39,778
will you grab my purse. Please?
It's next to the telephone.

788
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:42,614
Sure.

789
01:23:58,588 --> 01:24:00,674
Thank you.

790
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:05,929
Hello?

791
01:24:06,012 --> 01:24:08,014
Yes. It is.

792
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:11,685
What? Now?

793
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:16,939
Well. It's a little...

794
01:24:17,022 --> 01:24:20,276
All right. Tell him
I'll be over.

795
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:22,862
Yeah. Five minutes.
Yeah. Okay.

796
01:24:26,073 --> 01:24:28,701
The police are over at the clinic.
They want me to come by.

797
01:24:30,828 --> 01:24:33,038
How are you?

798
01:24:33,122 --> 01:24:35,791
Fine.

799
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:39,003
You've been through
a lot today.

800
01:24:39,086 --> 01:24:42,339
Don't worry.
I won't be long.

801
01:24:42,423 --> 01:24:44,717
I'm not gonna leave you.

802
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:56,395
Oh. God.

803
01:29:31,123 --> 01:29:36,503
Did you know that I can
see things. Priscilla?

804
01:29:36,587 --> 01:29:39,340
I can see things nobody can.

805
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,805
I'm so good...

806
01:29:46,889 --> 01:29:50,267
at predicting...

807
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:53,687
that I can read
tomorrow's headline.

808
01:29:56,273 --> 01:30:01,529
"A man last night broke into
the home of his ex-wife...

809
01:30:01,612 --> 01:30:06,033
"and killed for the third
and last time.

810
01:30:07,618 --> 01:30:09,537
"Arriving tragically too late...

811
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:15,709
"Eddy Otis. The woman's...
the dead woman's friend...

812
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:17,711
"shot and killed him.

813
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:24,301
"The man. Richard Parker.
was already wanted...

814
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:26,720
in connection
with several other..."

815
01:30:28,931 --> 01:30:32,560
Oh. Yes. He's here.

816
01:30:32,643 --> 01:30:37,063
Priscilla. He's in the house
right now. Wondering...

817
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:41,484
when he should make
his final move.

818
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:44,070
Why?

819
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:46,573
Because I wanted him to.

820
01:30:48,616 --> 01:30:52,287
He's my puppet.

821
01:30:54,873 --> 01:30:57,250
Here he comes.

822
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:01,087
Come on. Richard.

823
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:08,094
Come to papa.

824
01:34:30,919 --> 01:34:33,505
Here we are with
the WKPJ traffic news.

825
01:34:33,755 --> 01:34:36,967
Good news for all you happy
commuters wending your way home.

826
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:40,262
Traffic is flowing smoothly
on all major arteries.

827
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:44,391
In other news today, an Atlanta court
threw out all charges
against Richard Parker...

828
01:34:44,474 --> 01:34:47,601
in the murder case that shocked
the city earlier this year.

829
01:34:47,685 --> 01:34:50,980
Parker, the court concluded, was set up
by his neighbour, Eddy Otis...

830
01:34:51,063 --> 01:34:54,400
in what veteran insurance investigator
David Duttonville...

831
01:34:54,483 --> 01:34:57,695
called one of the most diabolical
life insurance scams on record.

832
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:01,532
When asked about his future plans,
Mr Parker said he intends...
