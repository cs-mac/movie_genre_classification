- Have a nice day.
- I love you too.

- Wait... what, what?
- Here.

Right? I mean...

It was only once, is a good guy,

26
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,260
was probably my fault.

27
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,263
No.

28
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:40,145
Your father abused him? What about yours?

29
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,480
Because... It's a cycle,

30
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:48,199
the abused,
becomes the abuser.

31

And what I'll do is
help you break that cycle.

And you, you know what you need
? A rescuer.

Need someone to protect you.

Yes - And the baby?

Jack is sweet, it is wonderful.

What about your job?

52

Yes, it is busy, but good.

53
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:12,282
So why the transition is going well?

54
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:13,700
Is the transition?

55
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:17,244
The baby, new home, new responsibilities
,

56
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,786
can be very stressful.

- Trying to help.

58
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,210
No, do not,

59

trying to undermine me.

60
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,214
Long time since our last session.

61
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:32,884
And you know why?
Would everyone here know it?

62

- That's basic psychology.
- Still Angry Wade.

63
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:40,016
- I'm not angry at Wade.
- Good. I do not know what to tell you this way.

64
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:44,773
I like you and enjoy the time together

but
keep apologizing for knowing Wade.

67
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:51,653
I do not like you to try to undermine it.

68
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:55,410
I can not be your patient more.

69

It's so easy, I pray to have one like it.

85
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,391
Sure you can tomorrow?
I do not want to take advantage.

86
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:42,226
Okay, really do not care.

87
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,604
Your parents are okay with this?

88
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:47,023
You're kidding, are happy that
has not fled to San Francisco.

89

Right.

another call or something.

What do you think?

94
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,180
I think it carries a time avoiding you.

95
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,730
- As in a while.
- Right?

96
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,184
Yeah?
Has been rare since my mom died.

I mean...

98
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:26,104

I wanted to be with the baby,

YES!

- So rare.

Is not it amazing that this alive?

104
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,296
I am very lucky.

By marriage.

106
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,513

- That's another thing.
- What?

109
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,569
Remember I told you that
call home once,

110

and his father answered and found it weird?

111
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:16,448
God knows...

112
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,243
Today, she was going out the door,

113
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:20,579
and note this bruise on his neck.

114

What do you mean?

115

00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:52,900
Oh, did not know that Jesus had spoken about
ghosts.

168
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:56,447
When someone dies,
going to Heaven with God,

169
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,323
or face the Final Judgment.

170
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:00,826
Okay...

171
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,868
So if anyone sees a ghost...

172
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:08,541
- What you see is a demon.
- A Demon?

173
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,418
Demons can disguise...

174
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,549
... dead people, to confuse us.

175
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:18,385
Do you believe that, you believe in demons?

176
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,011
If I believe in angels.
I believe in demons.

177
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:29,061
- How are you?
- Me? I'm fine.

178
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:29,729
Yeah?

179
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,649
- Things are good at home?
- Yeah, why?

180
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,651
No, for any reason.

181
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:38,612
So, yes, all is well.

182
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,493
I'm sorry, sorry,
'm nosy, sorry.

183
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:45,538
No, no... I want to say the job
My Dad has been...

184
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,121
... but that's it.

185
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:50,084
No, no, no. Sure, that's to be expected.

186
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,586
- So it's been a little...
-... is anxious.

187
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:55,423
- And my mom also.
-... By stress.

188
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,258
Clear.

189
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:00,011
But your father...

190
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,475
Demons can take many forms.

191
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,938
<i> - Do you believe in ghosts?
- No. </ i>

192
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,859
- Demons?
- I do not know, I do not think so.

193
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,775
Excellent, welcome to the twentieth century.

194
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,656
So, leaving aside the supernatural
,

195
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,573
... you seem to be seeing abused women.

196
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,994
Those may or may not actually be.

197
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm not seeing... With Ruth, I see...

198
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:32,086
If Ruth is being abused, then
come and talk to her.

199
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:33,380
It can not, by his father.

200
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,214
I tell  and I've said before,

201
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:38,424
should not advise the
people outside the office.

202
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,842
I saw some bruises on his throat.

203
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:44,641
We have a system to protect
customers and us.

204
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,434
- Is a matter of credibility.
- I do not understand...

205
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:50,021
reviews for trying to help a battered woman.

206
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:52,439
I say, there's a reason why
Center...

207
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,776
... is a psychologist here,
is not just for customers.

208
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,946
Moreover, it is the dream of Wade.

209
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,404
Y Wade do you trust?

210
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,158
- What does that mean?
- It's a simple question.

211
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,993
What does that mean?

212
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,248
He has a dream and you have the same dream
.

213
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,189
You say he's putting ideas in my head
?

214
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:14,171
- I did not say that.
- And I'm foolish enough to believe that.

215
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,216
- I did not say that.
- I trusted my life to Wade,

216
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:19,386
and I can not believe you asked me that.

217
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,140
Not know Wade,
you've never known.

218
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,844
Y
the only person I know who tries...

219
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:24,181
... putting ideas in my head, it's you.

220
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,222
Please... Keep your voice down.

221
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:28,686
Not think so, I came to you as a friend,
and this is what you're trying to make me.

222
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:29,728
Trying to help.

223
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,941
No, trying to control myself,
because that's what you do,

224
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,608
y bother you that you can no longer
letting me anymore.

225
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,194
I'm sorry you feel that way.

226
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,127
Wake up, wake up...

227
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,255
're here, here are
are here, come on.

228
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,046
- Come on.
- What?

229
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,090
Up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

230
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,051
- Fast, arise.
- What is it?

231
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,601
- Come on.
- Please stop.

232
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,931
- Come here, quick.
- What is it?

233
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:13,522
Wait what happens? Oh damn...

234
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:17,944
Son...

235
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,864
- This is...
- I know.

236
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,115
-
And that is... - I know, I know.

237
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:23,867
What do ?

238
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,889
Well, let's go.

239
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,555
- We have to go...
- Stop.

240
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:00,780
What the hell?

241
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:07,245
Where is your sister,
where your sister is?

242
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:13,543
Where is your sister,
where your sister is?

243
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:35,021
- What is it?
- I do not know, do not know.

244
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:37,358
- Were in my head...
- I know, I have no idea.

245
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:37,901
What do ?

246
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:39,569
No, no, no...

247
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:42,698
- We have to go.
- Jack is here.

248
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,959
Watch him... I'll see.

249
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:54,586
Lucy!

250
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:55,879
No, no... I'll be right back.

251
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,132
- No. ..
- I have to go see.

252
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:11,914
We have to get out of here,

253
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:14,791
we will stay with Kate, we have to think
Jack.

254
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,754
No, I do not want that, do not want Kate
I opine me.

255
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,508
- After what happened?
- What happened? Nothing happened.

256
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,467
That was out of my sleep.

257
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,010
No, it was not,

258
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,993
that will not happen to you, and it happened to me,

259
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:29,767
that's something that happened to them.

260
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:33,354
Do they, who are they?

261
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:37,898
They were living in this house
here before us.

262
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:39,733
- Okay got ghosts?
- Yes

263
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:44,156
Spirits of dead people, we are
living in a haunted house.

264
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,123
- Demons.
- What?

265
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,286
Ruth thinks are demons.

266
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:52,625
Where is your sister?...

267
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:53,956
What?

268
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,292
Father. What
repeated the father. He kept saying it.

269
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,335
Where is your sister?

270
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:00,171
... Sister was missing,
sister was not there.

271
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,471
The sister survived.

272
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,682
What are you talking about?

273
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:16,024
Were two daughters, he had four plates
right?

274
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:18,773
Y repeated where your sister is,
sister was lost.

275
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:20,527
Sister...

276
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,866
I bet she
still lives in town.

277
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:29,348
My God, I bet it is a
client.

278
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:32,706
I bet she is one customer
Center.

279
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:35,334
- Listen to you at this time.
- Wade, Wade...

280
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,380
- What we have just seen?
- Saw...

281
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,264
What did you see what happened?

282
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,590
- That was my dream.
- No.

283
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,468
No, we saw a family in crisis.

284
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,720
- I can fix this.
- No.

285
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,310
Glen taught me to break the cycle.

286
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:56,523
... And what we saw was a
family trapped in a cycle.

287
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,613
I can fix this.

288
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,587
I find it strange discuss ghosts.

289
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,880
I saw, saw Wade.

290
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,925
- Wade saw?
- I told you.

291
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:23,886
- Back to my original question.
- What is that?

292
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:24,972
Do you trust Wade?

293
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:27,887
- Are you kidding?
- We talk about ghosts.

294
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,725
I can not, not that I was upset.

295
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:36,189
Need your help, can you help me
? Want to help?

296
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,609
I want to help, so I think that...

297
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:41,325
...
regular sessions should start again.

298
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,948
... There has to be me,
if that makes you feel uncomfortable.

299
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,242
're Going through something, obviously.

300
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:52,078
Speak
that help me with a concrete thing.

301
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:57,043
Ghosts?
A family of abused ghosts?

302
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,420
And maybe an abused nanny.

303
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:03,173
No, I speak of a file,
I speak of a woman who came here perhaps.

304
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,596
I say yes
file exists, that's confidential.

305
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:07,847
It is not my position to give
"Ghostbusters."

306
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,392
Why are you here?
Have an opinion of women,

307
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,736
and you know what?

308
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:20,235
... I'm almost tell everything to Gale.

309
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:21,401
And say...

310
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:24,405
... about you, about us.

311
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,285
So think about it, while looking for that file
.

312
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,339
Mrs. Gold is here.

313
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:42,048
Great!

314
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:46,553
Oh Janice, you still know the guy...

315
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:48,263
... file in the office?

316
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,188
- Phil?
- Yes

317
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:50,807
Yeah? I need a favor.

318
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:53,311
- Well, I'll call.
- Great, thanks.

319
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:04,862
<i> So... </ i>

320
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:08,074
- Glen So, it does not help.
- No, Glen is a dead end.

321
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,163
Still angry break up with him.

322
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,205
And the more angry, more
indifferent, so...

323
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:19,064
In 1986 David Martel built this house.

324
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,336
Okay, I was married or had children
?

325
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:24,967
Do not know, do not you find out yet, but if
if you have them.

326
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:25,682
Why?

327
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:27,678
Look at this place, has four bedrooms
.

328
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,764
's Huge.

329
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:33,143
- Okay...
- So, the house was sold,

330
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:37,313
in 1992, but that's not the interesting part
.

331
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,607
What is the interesting part?

332
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:43,698
David Martel stopped paying property taxes
1988

333
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:47,448
and the house did not happen to other people
until 1991

334
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,951
Okay?
Stopped paying property taxes, why?. ..

335
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:54,790
- Because he was dead.
- Really, you know?

336
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,884
What else could it be? Tell me!

337
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,588
Could have lost work or sick.

338
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:03,048
-... Or move to Florida.
- Wade, come on!

339
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,217
-
Come... - What?

340
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,553
We saw, you saw them.

341
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:09,889
This, this, everything fits.

342
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,266
Yes, I saw them, it was.

343
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:15,686
Lucy, I'm afraid.

344
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:20,275
Okay? I say we call
Kate and Jack away from here.

345
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,193
No, no, we're not leaving.

346
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:23,403
There we go!

347
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,533
No we'll take our son with Kate.

348
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:29,952
Now we have a name, just have to find
sister.

349
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,209
- What is that?
- What?

350
00:28:39,244 --> 00:28:41,629
- On your shoulder?
- What?

351
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:45,385
- What is that?
- I do not know what you talking about?

352
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,095
Come here, what happened?

353
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:49,597
What?

354
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:54,684
My God, someone scratched.

355
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:58,104
How is that possible?

356
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:06,114
- My God.
- What?

357
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,874
- What?
- Is anybody out.

358
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,880
Hey, there you are. Where were you?

359
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,093
Were outside, I followed.

360
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:33,847
Outside? Are you okay?

361
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,699
Only... I could swear,

362
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:52,119
- I saw you.
- I know. Okay, okay.

363
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:57,914
Do you think I'm losing my mind?

364
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:08,050
I believe that this thing, whatever it is that is
is affecting us.

365
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:11,680
And I think we have to get out of here.

366
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:17,185
No, I will not do that.

367
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:22,521
Father will not let me win.

368
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:27,946
<i> Sorry about yesterday </ i>

369
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:32,075
- I threatened.
- I know, sorry.

370
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,828
You're the only person I can talk
this.

371
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,792
Just give me a formal session and
get to the bottom of this.

372
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:41,957
- Glen, please.
- Sessions used to help.

373
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,469
If you care about me, for something...

374
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,840
Of course I care, but not
be here.

375
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,175
Glen can you hear me?

376
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,092
That do.

377
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:53,181

.

378
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,306
Era Martel.

379
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,809
If anyone in the files or is married
...

380
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,684
Lucy, I told you...

381
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:00,479
Yeah, I know, but what's in
risk here...

382
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:03,109
? What's at risk?
Did you even know there's at risk?

383
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,777
I have to find to stop this,

384
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,780
- Lucy.

385
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,156

Doctors, someone in the hospital,

388
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:17,745
Someone has to know who she is.

389
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,630
Help me, please.

390
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,349

401
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:14,097
- Well, that was hard.
- Sorry, sorry.

402
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:18,351
I'm sorry.
I'm just here in this situation.

Kate, please.

00:36:35,954 --> 00:36:37,204
Well, you follow the advice of your...

410
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:39,790
... crazy nanny worshiper of Jesus,
can not get any worse than that.

411
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:43,752
I know since you were born, what about me

412
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:48,215
makes you think a psychic would
get to my house?

413
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,105
Hello, thank you very much for coming
, I'm Lucy.

414
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,941
Hi I am Mara.

415
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,116
It's just...

416
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:17,080
It is better to go through the house, without any preconceived
, affecting.

417
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,505
This is where...

418
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,430
But the paint was...

419
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:25,232
An entity
may be tied to a place or a person.

420
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,404
How, follow someone?

421
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:30,448
Emotion can also be a factor,

422
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,823
an agitated mind,
can raise events.

423
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,242
How are things between you and...?

424
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:39,371
Wade, Wade is well.

425
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:41,546
No!

426
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,044
We've been fine until this
...

427
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,961
Anyone else spend much time here?

428
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:49,886
The Nanny, Ruth.

429
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:55,387
She's going wrong,

430
00:38:55,554 --> 00:39:01,518
... his father is, do you think Ruth,

431
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:04,773
-... or Wade, or me?
- Jack O?

432
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:10,363
- Jack is a boy.
- Jack is a person.

433
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:12,281
Do you know what that means links?

434
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:15,919
've Heard the word.

435
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,079
A nexus is a person who draws
him or her paranormal entities.

436
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:23,499
- Do you think that is Ruth?
- I do not know.

437
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,380
- Jack O?
- I do not know.

438
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:32,261
Well, what do you think, I have to do?

439
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,054
What do I have here?

440
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:38,516
Lucy, I feel nothing abnormal
with this house.

441
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:41,768
And do not say  no experienced anything
,

442
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:44,231
I just can not feel anything.

443
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:49,695
I've seen, Wade also seen.

444
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,989
I have no reason to doubt you.

445
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,493
There is a portrait of a man with a hammer
made on my wall.

446
00:39:56,618 --> 00:39:58,620
I'm sure that you can alter.

447
00:39:58,662 --> 00:39:59,705
? Alter?

448
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,837
I have been to many houses and
under many different circumstances.

449
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:08,214
Not feel anything abnormal.

Look at the fucking wall.

455
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:40,923
How could she...

456
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,459
I think she came and gave you,

457
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,252
good advice and
little perspective.

458
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:47,338
I did not want  perspective!

459
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,506
- I wanted, I wanted...
- Validation?

460
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,137
Do not need validation,

461
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:58,431
not need it, do you agree
? Me you got me.

462
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,726

Can we try?

464
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:25,670
- What time is it?
- It's 3:00.

00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,759
What did your sister?

486
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:39,388
I said this is ridiculous.

487
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:42,475
- What did your sister?
- Do I need to call...

488
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,647
- What did your sister!
- Do not know what you want me to say.

489
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:50,570
How's the baby?

490
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:55,822
Not allowed to damage it.

491
00:45:56,865 --> 00:46:03,162
... Is not allowed to harm me or my husband,

492
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,542
or my son.

493
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:10,337
I have to.

494
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,608
- No. ..
- Wait.

495
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:33,778
Just me, okay, okay.

496
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:38,115
<i> Do not understand at all </ i>

497
00:46:38,157 --> 00:46:41,994
Said what
said her sister? It was very specific.

498
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:44,588
<i> I said nothing </ i>

499
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:49,668
Kate.
I need your help now, what you told me?

500
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:52,590
<i> Lucy, this is scaring me </ i>

501
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:58,680
Maybe, maybe before...
You said something about my perfect marriage.

502
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,303
<i> Lucy </ i>

503
00:47:00,762 --> 00:47:03,440
No, no, let's talk about that.

504
00:47:03,475 --> 00:47:06,688
Because I know, I know you're jealous of me.

505
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:07,855
I know!

506
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:10,941
- Lucy please!
- I know, I know.

507
00:47:11,484 --> 00:47:13,736
... I know you wanted to have a baby and
and...

508
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,029
... You have not met the right type
. But...

509
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,873
<i> Please do not do this </ i>

510
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:21,285
But you asked how your sister now.

511
00:47:21,496 --> 00:47:25,666
<i> If... You know? I need... </ i>

512
00:47:26,332 --> 00:47:27,458
<i> gotta go... </ i>

513
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:28,333
What?

514
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:31,002
What, Kate? Say what?

515
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:33,756
<i> No. Okay, just, I must go </ i>

516
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:36,052
Kate!

517
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:42,788
- I'm sorry, sorry to bother you.
- OK.

518
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:46,104
- I feel so stupid.
- Really okay.

519
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:49,021
Did not see anyone around the house?

520
00:47:50,023 --> 00:47:53,485
- Now that you mention it...
- What?

521
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,738
A couple of days, I thought
was nothing unusual,

522
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:58,498
but there was a guy at the house.

523
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:01,202
- Are you kidding?
- I thought I was a walker or something.

524
00:48:01,237 --> 00:48:03,913
- How does she look?
- Sorry, I was away.

525
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:06,666
I could not see it, it was just a guy...

526
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:15,049
I'm sorry, sorry, do not know who you
go or who to trust more.

527
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:16,850
Want to know what I think?

528
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:19,220
Yes, I want to know what you think.

529
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:23,266
In the Church have taught us about demonic possession
.

530
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:27,688
Okay...

531
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:32,152
Does
Wade knows things he should not...

532
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:33,985
... or suddenly speaks Latin, or something?

533
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:37,529
- No, no, no.
- Or perhaps is super strong.

534
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,492
- No.
- Or speak with another voice.

535
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:41,161
No.

536
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:44,538
Have a bite or scratch unusual?

537
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:50,127
What does that mean, what
means? Is it a demon?

538
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:52,923
What is a demon, really?

539
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,132
Been
heard about the spirit of Ahab?

540
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:59,637
? Ahab, as Captain Ahab
in Moby Dick?

541
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:04,099
Well, the Ahab spirit,
is an ancient demon.

542
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:08,027
Is very angry and very powerful.

543
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:12,152
Well,
take any kind of shape or what...

544
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:14,695
Take the shape you want.

545
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:16,864
What it does

546
00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:22,869
Destroys families, that's what you want,

547
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:27,331
takes the soul of the father and
forces destroy his family.

548
00:49:30,044 --> 00:49:34,215
Do not know, do not know if I can accept that.

549
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:37,342
What you see every day at the Center,

550
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:38,553
the stories you tell me...

551
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:39,686
I mean...

552
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:41,808
A man beats his wife
, hit their children...

553
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:44,933
get drunk or drugs, rapes his daughter.

554
00:49:46,976 --> 00:49:48,311
Want to break the cycle?

555
00:49:49,063 --> 00:49:50,188
That's what you're up against,

556
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,941
Ahab  spirit
entered in the souls of men,

557
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:54,486
from the beginning of everything.

558
00:49:54,988 --> 00:49:56,404
That's what you're up against.

559
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:01,075
- You see that?
- Oh.

560
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:03,413
God... Okay, I can see
. Can you see?

561
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,621
Of course I see, is my father.

562
00:50:06,162 --> 00:50:07,416
Why are you here?

563
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:11,128
I think I can be angry,
not tell him to come.

564
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,546
Would you talk to him?

565
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,676
No, I'll do it, all will be well.

566
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:20,721
- Ruth, where were you?
- Sorry.

567
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:22,891
- Your mother know you are concerned.
- Sorry.

568
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,644
Ma'am, sorry to bother you, but I have to take
Ruth home.

569
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:26,769
Hi, I'm Lucy, who are you?

570
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:29,395
'm Your father, come on... Get in the car.

571
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,946
-
She's 19 - What.?

572
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:32,691
Not less, not
has to go with you.

573
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,528
- In the car.
- Do not have to go with it.

574
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:37,197
Sorry Lucy.

575
00:50:37,697 --> 00:50:39,865
Lady incumbent
not really okay?

576
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,802
Calm down, there's no reason to panic
.

577
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:03,807
Glen, this is real, this is
really going on, do not you understand that?

578
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:04,684
Lucy!

579
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:08,437
No. I'm talking to psychics,
I'm talking to my nurse,

580
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,483
y
the only person who does not help me here, is you.

581
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:15,151
I want to help, I'm helping you.

582
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:19,032
No. I know you want to do another session.

583
00:51:19,072 --> 00:51:20,491
I would clarify all the confusion.

584
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:21,992
No. You know what?

585
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:24,996
There is a portrait of a man with a hammer
on my wall.

586
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:29,507
My husband, my nanny and I have seen these things
...

587
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,127
... Walking around the house and tell me
it's all in my mind.

588
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,716
I think
session will help you discover the root cause.

589
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,218
No, do not help me find Sister
,

590
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,096
're jealous of Wade or
you try and help me with Ruth.

591
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:42,345
All you want to hypnotize.

592
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:44,307
Lucy, you sound hysterical.

593
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,017
You just want to control me!

594
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,853
Just want to control and manipulate.

595
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:51,981
Because you're a small
and angry man.

596
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:58,823
I offer a possible solution.

597
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,076
No, what you're trying to do, is try to break
,

598
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,037
and not let you do that.

599
00:54:14,256 --> 00:54:16,507
Jesus, what happened?

600
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:27,434
<i> Not remember anything </ i>

601
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:34,199
I do not think that was your intention.

602
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:38,652
Lucy, you know I would never do anything to hurt you
, right?

603
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,836
Well...

604
00:55:06,973 --> 00:55:07,975
Lucy...

605
00:55:09,602 --> 00:55:11,395
Ruth, hello...

606
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:12,647
Hello.

607
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:15,609
Is everything okay?

608
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:18,236
I wanted to ask the same.

609
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,987
Why?

610
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,658
Your father...

611
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:26,871
No, everything is fine, really. All right.

612
00:55:26,913 --> 00:55:30,041
- You tell me.
- What? Why?

613
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:33,169
I'm ready for this.

614
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:37,214
I do not know what you mean.

615
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:39,716
Do not have to suffer because you are not alone
.

616
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,342
I can help you break the cycle.

617
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:44,471
Okay...

618
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:46,642
Look... I should go.

619
00:55:46,725 --> 00:55:50,319
- Your father rapes you...
- What?

620
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:53,562
I know you've tried to
and tell me I can protect you.

621
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:57,025
What my father raped me... what do you say?

622
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,903
Do not have to be afraid anymore.

623
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:01,863
That's disgusting, what's wrong?

624
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:07,245
Try to help and that's what you thought
all the time.

625
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:09,791
What kind of person are you?
So you do your job?

626
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:10,673
No.

627
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:13,544
You pick random women and invent
nasty things about them.

628
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:15,125
No, not you, do not do that.

629
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,798
's Because I'm Christian,
that's because you think so,

630
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,136
think yes
someone believes something must be ignorant.

631
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:23,303
I do not think that.

632
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,681
Please. Do not call more.

633
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:50,082
A few minutes ago I called Gale.

634
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:56,464
And he asked me to tell
you're suspended.

635
00:56:57,422 --> 00:56:58,966
I messed up.

636
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:01,052
Do not concentrate on this.

637
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:03,805
I do not know what I'm doing.

638
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,142
You going through something.

639
00:57:09,183 --> 00:57:12,228
Do not know, do not know what's happening.

640
00:57:15,396 --> 00:57:18,276
What do ? Help me,

641
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:21,239
please.

642
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:31,540
Want you to look
pen and you focus on the pen.

643
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:35,671
There is nothing else except the pen.

644
00:57:36,629 --> 00:57:38,338
No more anything except the pen.
