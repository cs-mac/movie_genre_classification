00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,989

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,148

23
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,832
Who the fuck is that ?

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,355
ToIIander. Did you send someone in ?

25
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,550
Didn't send anyone in, Bishop !
No one !

26
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,228
I am telling you. He is one of ours !

27
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:45,326
Repeat! We did not send anyone in!
Hold your positions !

28
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,829
He is against the terrorists.
He has opened fire !

29
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,109
Get them out!
Send your team in there, now !

30
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,071
Man ! I'm going in !

31
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,915
Who the fuck are you ?
Are you carzy ?

32
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,830
Sherwood !
- Nothing personal, Bishop !

33
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,393
Ouch ! Just business !

34
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,158
Sorry, Love !

00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:24,470

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,717

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,870
So you're having a good day ?
That is about to change !

45
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:56,312
Mark this is Smith. Confirm position.
The captain says it is 31 A !

46
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,670
31 A confirmed !

47
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,594
This job, means need to look
smart and not like hired beef

48
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,755
We are not hired beef !

49
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:20,508
Consider this as an advance. Get some stuff
for you and buy a new pair of shoes !

50
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,108
Clasic like yours ?

51
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,153
No, new !
- Thanks, this is comfortable !

52
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,268
Contact Senator Todd and tell that
I'm meeting him next week !

53
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,751
Excuse, Mr. Trent. We'll be
disembarking in a few minutes !

54
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:47,310
Thanks...
- Michael !

55
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,275
Right, Michael !
- Forgive my husband. !

56
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,958
Mrs. Trent, Your car will be waiting
to take you directly to your club !

57
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:59,234
Do you play Michael ?
- Mrs. Trent ?

58
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,913
Golf, of course !
- No !

59
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,891
That's a failing on your part ...
So as calling me Mrs. Trent.

60
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:10,626
Now Michael, Fix me a drink.
I like a Tequini, a Martini....

61
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,472
I'm not a bartender, Mrs. Trent !

62
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,627
State of the art protection !
I really wish you wear armour !

63
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,955
Everyone assumes we do !

64
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,351
They compensate.
- They, who?

65
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,591
Whoever.

66
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,956
We're opening the doors.
Bring the cars around.

67
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:47,517
I spy with my little eyes, something
that begins with the letter "B"

68
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,039
Bodyguard

69
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,591
Ah ! Ouch...!

70
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,909
One Mississippi ...
Two Mississippi... It's bang.

71
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,539
Two seconds is a mile and a
half away and may be 2 !

72
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,073
Got him !
- I don't see anything ?

73
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,252
He's on the roof !
- They are firing Bishop ! Firing !

74
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,510
Keep her down ! Keep her down !
- He is on the roof !

75
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,634
Dedicated little bastard.
Aren't you mine ?

76
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,790
Very good, Mr.Bodyguard !

77
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,188
It's your lucky day, Mr.Bodyguard.

78
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,155
Hold it !

79
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,303
Hey ! How're you doing ?

80
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:14,189
Oh you know you've got speed.
You're 30 seconds early !

81
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,753
Stop !
- Why ?

82
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,348
I shoot you if I have to !
- No, No. You won't ...

83
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,111
... But if you did at that distance,
my upper part will be your best bet.

84
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,114
But then, may be I'm wearing armour ?

85
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,348
I said don't move !

86
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,948
You know hitting my head is
rather difficult target...

87
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,077
... specially when the cock in
your revolver is not armed.

88
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,115
That makes the first shot
needing double action.

89
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,731
No no. Head's going to be
terribley difficult to make !

90
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,668
Excuse me !

91
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:16,189
And look, you use two hands to hold
the revolver, and I use only one.

92
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,875
Shut up, Shut up or I'll shoot  !
- Oh, calm down love! Have it ...

93
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,672
... your way.

94
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:35,720
He has a gun !
- What the hell happened ?

95
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,424
Let's go !
- Thank you for coming !

96
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:09,510
See you later !
- Coming !

97
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:15,995
Do not touch !
You should not you play with food !

98
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:19,805
Be happy ! Please !
These are yours !

99
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,554
Let's take these plates !

100
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:29,082
Wait ! Reply me !

101
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:33,795
It spreads everywhere now !
- I know ... nanny is home today ...

102
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,071
HeIIo ... Mrs. NieIsen.

103
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,071
Mr. Putley. Yes sir.

104
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:45,557
Of course I appreciate your
confidence sir.

105
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,057
See you in 20 minutes.
Yes Sir ! Thank you !

106
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,634
Agent Castle !
- Mr. Putley. Sir, I just arrived.

107
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:14,598
I'll find out who is holding the suspects.
- Detective Seargent Harris

108
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,913
Has he been informed that
we are taking over?

109
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,713
Apparently not.

110
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:21,958
I want you shooting all over the terrace.
- Excuse ! Detective Harris ?

111
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:24,958
Detective Sergeant Harris !
I'm a little busy right now.

112
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,552
Special agent Castle, sir.
- A Fed?

113
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,564
We should've the place clean.

114
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:34,588
You are not here to give me any hassle
about jurisdiction, Mrs. Castle ?

115
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,791
No, Sir the jurisdiction is very clear.
- Good.

116
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,675
The instance the first bullet crossed the
airport, this becomes a matter of the Bureau.

117
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:48,553
I have a dead man who never got
within 2 miles of your airport !

118
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,557
Detective Harris, would you
give me a coffee please?

119
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,557
What? Fuck yourself !

120
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,797
Then you're of not use to me whatsoever.

121
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,597
Pull out your men. Seal the roof.
FBI team will arrive in 20 minutes.

122
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,898
Thanks !

123
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,629
Is that the suspect over there ?
- Yes, he is there.

124
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:22,031
9mm Baretta, modeI JFS,
large magazine capacity...

125
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,031
Capable of four autaomatic fire.

126
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,112
Muzzle velocity ?

127
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:30,712
350 meters per second, but I always think
it is impressive in feet ! Don't you ?

128
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,875
It is my gun, not my penis,
Detective !

129
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,516
Special Agent CastIe.
- A Fed ?!

130
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,591
Terrific !

131
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,837
How long did you work for Trents ?
- For 12 days !

132
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,391
Who hired you ?

133
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,799
His chief of security, Jack Marker !
Now he is dead !

134
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,110
Did you receive any briefing regarding
any of Mr. Trent's enemies ?

135
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:57,388
He had them.
- That's evident !

136
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,388
Do you know you're played dead ?

137
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,990
Pay the salary !
- Afraid not this week !

138
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,555
Can I ask you something, Agent Castle ?
- Hm....

139
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,038
Why do you have ice cream
all over your notes ?

140
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,038
It's my daughter's birthday today !

141
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:18,636
But you're here...
Dedicated or ambitious ?

142
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,153
Mr. Bishop, In most
successful assasinations,

143
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,153
bodyguards are killed with
with their principles.

144
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,117
And those who aren't,
half are involved with murder.

145
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,791
Straight for the jugular !
- Where will I see you ?

146
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,275
At the Trent's estate !
That if you're not holding me.

147
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,156
I don't know you that well,

148
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,156
but I will have to confiscate your weapon.
You won't need it! We are taking over now.

149
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:45,790
Sure Doc ! Keep it warm for me !
- You are free to go !

150
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,878
Thank you for your time !
- And I thank you!

151
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,870
Fifteen dollars !
- Here, keep the rest !

152
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:01,524
Thank you !

153
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,070
Bishop to Queen's knight 2 !

154
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:15,865
Bishop to Queen's knight 2 !
Absurd !

155
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,353
I wonder what you learned
at the Naval Academy !

156
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:22,353
As always, you mistake ...
- Improvisation for artistry.

157
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:25,668
Michael.....Michael.....Michael....

158
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,954
Appear as an angel,
casting shadows of my past.

159
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,391
How are you, my dear ?
- I'm alive, professor !

160
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:34,191
And you ?

161
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:42,038
Bureau and our whole espionage empire
are conspiring to bore me to death.

162
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,124
I find it hard to believe you ?

163
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:50,874
As far as I remember, your simplest
games were the ones we dreaded most.

164
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,948
Battle of Judah! Biblical
version of the Gulf War.

165
00:21:56,154 --> 00:22:00,882
An army inspired by God, and you
collide with advanced technology.

166
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:03,941
Lord was with Judas,
but he could not drive the

167
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:08,469
inhabitants from the plane, because
they had chariots of iron.

168
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:13,772
Judges, 1:19! Old testate !

169
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:18,835
Even though you were on the side
of the angels this time ?

170
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,849
An old heathen like me ?

171
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:26,228
I prefer men of iron
instead of clay idols.

172
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,830
Simon ...
- I heard all about Jeffry Trent !

173
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:41,825
Television networks were full
of him. They are shocked !

174
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:45,864
It's also very tedious.

175
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:52,394
I'm a bodyguard professor, I'm
not supposed to lose my client !

176
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:57,877
Poor Michael, a samurai
without his Shogun !

177
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:01,839
Marco ! Refreshments !

178
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:06,322
Have we no manners ?

179
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:21,009
Is silent ! But very
very beautiful !

180
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:27,331
Well Michael, Shall we discuss
this ridiculous move of yours.

181
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:40,656
The reminder that requests
State contraband reports, Jess ?

182
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,648
Hello, Lindsay ! It's me, Can I
speak to Melissa for a minute ?

183
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:48,012
Mr Putley, We are preparing ourselves !
- There's some company for you to catch !

184
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:51,179
Company ?
- Secret company !

185
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,660
Jess, introduce yourself
to my daughter !

186
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,060
Sure !

187
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,735
Hi Melissa, this is Jess !
Work together with your mom.

188
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:03,737
Apparently CIA had Jeffry Trent
under surveillance for the past year.

189
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:07,303
Now in the interst of
inter-departmental corporation

190
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:11,303
and to help keep company smooth,
and even hiding in my underworld jobs

191
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:15,300
I've given them permission
to observe your operation.

192
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,864
Observe, nothing more !
- I understand Sir.

193
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,904
Have fun, Castle !

194
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:44,402
Nice piece of work on Mr. Trent.

195
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:47,660
The fact is that the assasin
not only blown his heart out...

196
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,360
but has put a gate
through him !

197
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:52,959
Oh I'm sorry ! He is Mr. Hickey !
And I am Nicholas Tollander !

198
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:54,959
Let me guess ! You're the officer
in charge of research ?

199
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,959
Yes, Special Agent Castle !

200
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,123
Why is the Agency interested
in our dead body now ?

201
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:06,167
Jeffrey Trent amassed a fortune !
Computers, missile guidance systems.

202
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:09,252
Few mismanaged defence contracts...

203
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,252
and  recession almost put
him out of business.

204
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,892
Check !

205
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:21,455
So he quit living a life of good,
patron of humanitarian actions ..

206
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,778
in war torn countries like Bosnia, South
Africa...and flying injured orphans out...

207
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:29,258
At the same time, his financial problems
began to mesteriously clear up...

208
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,498
Believe Agent Castle,
he was running guns !

209
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,498
Now understand how delicate
the situation is !

210
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:39,821
So he was running guns ?
Who wanted Trent dead ?

211
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:46,463
A short list.. Lybians, Iranians...
- Check !

212
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:54,978
Iraqis, Germans ! Any number of
swindled businessmen, Spurn lovers...

213
00:25:55,713 --> 00:26:00,388
Why this sudden obssession
on who killed Trent ?

214
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:05,112
I would've never recommend you for the
job if I knew you become so upset !

215
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:09,065
I'm not !
- Good, Michael !

216
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:15,836
It's Chess gives us the luxury of seeing
all the men anticipating all moves....

217
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,516
Life isn't so forgiving...

218
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:23,718
I never show the shooter
who put me in this chair....

219
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:26,718
Was he one of theirs, one of ours...

220
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,963
Some bureaucrats suddenly
disliked my lifestyle....

221
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,917
Made me a security risk....

222
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,917
I thought I was protected
by our rules...

223
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:46,921
Indifference to chance is a
great vanity in any game....

224
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:55,290
Was Trent indiffernt to chance ?
- Jeffery was indifferent to everything !

225
00:26:55,536 --> 00:27:00,370
But Jeffery was seduced by power....
Wanted to be the king of the arms deals !

226
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:05,772
Certainly didn't care who got
trampled on the way to the cognition !

227
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:09,408
And now his kingdom is up for grabs !

228
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:20,099
Long live...
- The White queen !

229
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:38,320
The fare ?
- 25 de dollars !

230
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,730
Hold !
- Thanks !

231
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:57,553
Here!

232
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,774
It's all yours !

233
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:08,774
I'll wait in the car ! Bye !

234
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:11,700
Won't you stay ?

235
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:15,700
No ! I think a man's first case
should be a personal thing...

236
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,585
Besides you need the car ready.
Good luck !

237
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,938
I appreciate your concern,
Agent Castle !

238
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,438
I feel safe if...
Bishop protects me !

239
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,552
Oh I'm afraid it is not so
simple, Mrs Trent !

240
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:55,915
Our investigation is still on going !
- I want Bishop as my head of security !

241
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:59,399
After all he was the only one
who reacted this morning.

242
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:02,963
All of the others ... ah they just...
- Died ?

243
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,363
Yes.

244
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:08,961
Can I get my gun back now ?

245
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,325
Get down !

246
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:23,012
Get down !

247
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:30,450
Get down !

248
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:33,167
Give me the gun !

249
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,167
Where the hell are you ?

250
00:31:57,534 --> 00:32:00,485
Another one for your collection, Castle !
- Thank you !

251
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:02,685
You are a one hell of shot my boy ...

252
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:05,190
... but did you have to
kill my only lead ?

253
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,669
I'm sorry ! May be I was
shooting in fear.

254
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,969
Who is he ?

255
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,971
His name was Elliot Holden !

256
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:15,571
He was a former Trent employee !

257
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,420
He also used to be Mrs, Trent's
favourite past times !

258
00:32:20,423 --> 00:32:23,380
Yes, get it to a ballistics please !
- May I see that ?

259
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:27,933
This is my investigation Mr. Bishop !
- Trents were my responsibility.

260
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:30,854
Put this on !

261
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:33,854
Thanks !

262
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:42,177
This is not the man who killed my client !
Really? Enlighten us !

263
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:52,348
Rifle butt is too short for his size.

264
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:56,752
You see that mark here ?
- Yeah! What about it ?

265
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,704
It's called an "idiot guide" !

266
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:01,704
He was too close to the
scope when he fired !

267
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,951
- An amateur's mistake !

268
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:06,351
Look Mr. Bishop ! In this
morning you didn't jackshit,

269
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,151
and now you're full of answers.

270
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:13,272
Let me show you something, Castle !

271
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:20,200
See that green mailbox ?
- Yes !

272
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,200
Set the scope at dead centre !

273
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:28,287
Are you on ?
- Yeah ! I'm on ! So What ?

274
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:35,930
You son of a bitch, this is vital
evidence! Should have you arrested !

275
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,326
Take a look at your mark.

276
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:44,049
The sights are off.

277
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:48,485
Telescope sight does not match the eye !
A professional wouldn't use the weapon !

278
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,725
And he didn't.

279
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:05,688
What's that for ?
- The "idiot guide"... Your's.

280
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,368
Hey, Mikey. Give you a lift ?

281
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,868
You took me for a ride once Nick.

282
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:34,187
Hey Mikey. I'm hurt over here !
Your court martial wasn't personal !

283
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,351
I told them that I believe you,
but someone had to pay

284
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,751
or the heat still would've persued.

285
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:42,823
I guess there wouldn't have been an
initiative if I hadn't pulled through.

286
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:46,271
Yeah ! Bad form on your part.

287
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,671
Mikey between you and me ?
Do you know the mess with Rifi ?

288
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:58,438
Before my time.
-"Before my time". Good answer.

289
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:03,163
So you're not involved
in this mess Mikey.

290
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:36,134
You left this at the airport.
- Home, sweet home.

291
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,850
Why not you get in ?
I'll give you a ride.

292
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,787
Sherwood, Kill that fucking light !

293
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:38,396
Your daughter..... How old ?
- MeIissa turns five today.

294
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,200
And she had chocolate
cake for her birthday ?

295
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:44,200
With vanilla icing.

296
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:57,120
You're in over your head.
Someone's playing you Castle !

297
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,567
Mr. Bishop. Leave this to
the paid professionals

298
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,567
and don't leave the town.
Yeah ! I know that well !

299
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:34,489
Cash or card Mr... Orsava ?
- It'll be cash.

300
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:42,100
302.
- Thank you.

301
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:57,181
What ?
- Well I'm to inform you that they...

302
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,267
With what ?
Would you like me to stay ?

303
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:04,267
Should the bodyguard prove troublesome...
- That's only because....

304
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:07,350
Oh ! you have them wired my usual fee
to the same Ireland account...

305
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:10,672
Two days will be sufficient.

306
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:25,955
Lindsey.

307
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:36,841
Lindsey... Wake up.
Why don't you go to your bed ?

308
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,560
What time is it ?
- It is real late.

309
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:43,887
Your boss called. He said to see
him first thing tomorrow.

310
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,399
That figures. Goodnight !
- Goodnight !

311
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,599
I love you baby !

312
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:05,255
Who you are trying to
get away from, Bishop?

313
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,340
Court Martial,
Deposistion Nicholas Tollander.

314
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,340
Fired without honor !

315
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,802
Report, Castle !
- Sir !

316
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:22,428
I've got agents canvassing the airport
hotel with Eliot Holden's photos !

317
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:25,564
But I'm not convinced that he shot
Trent. Besides calibre 22 ....

318
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:29,564
Ballistics claims that scope
was changed before he dropped it...

319
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:34,854
... And when accidentally fired by us.
- I didn't see these findings sir.

320
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,614
There's a copy waiting for
you since 9 this morning.

321
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:41,375
You said Holden and
Mrs. Trent were involved ?

322
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:44,375
They had a brief affair but it
ended when he got fired 6 months ago.

323
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:48,694
That seems pretty cut and dry to me.
A crime of passion.

324
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:52,117
Didn't frustrate job.
Congratulations !

325
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,817
One of Trent's bodyguards
pointed out inconsistencies...

326
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:57,785
I don't know we assigned
a bodyguard to this case.

327
00:42:58,029 --> 00:42:59,785
Case is closed

328
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:33,095

329
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:00,304
How're you doing, Lou ?
- I'm fine.

330
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,304
Good !

331
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:09,071
You know, the first time I signed a
report, I was anxious for weeks.

332
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:13,758
I get wondering if some...
you'd send was jab up Mikey's ass ..

333
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:16,076
Charming ! Get to the point,
Mr Tollander !

334
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:20,676
You read Mikey's file ?
- I sure did !

335
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:25,078
Good ! Then you know about that
little incident in Bosnia ?

336
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:27,078
Yes.

337
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:33,998
Mikey had a mission to rescue four
Serbian officers that were being...

338
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:38,647
held captive by some Muslim
terrorists. It went sour !

339
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:43,688
I also read that your testimony
earned him a dishonourable discharge !

340
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:48,283
Come on ! They wanted to put the man into
Leavenworth. I saved him from that !

341
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:51,731
I like Mickey.
A real stand up guy.

342
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:57,767
I just don't know what happened to him.
- Your point...?

343
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:02,036
My point is Agent Castle, that the
Agency believes, as a matter of fact...

344
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,336
we know that Trent armed
those terrorists....

345
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:09,179
Bishop wanted to avenge against Trent ?

346
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:12,379
You think he conspired with Elliot
Holden ? Get real !

347
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:16,784
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind here.

348
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:21,336
I find it a little bit convenient
that Mikey is working for Trent..

349
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:26,344
and that he also underhand whacked Holden
before you got a chance to question him.

350
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:32,144
He was in the line of fire.
- In the line of fire...

351
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:37,823
I got you !

352
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:45,514
You know. I hadn't thought about that.
It a hell of an alibi, then ?

353
00:46:45,998 --> 00:46:48,636
Have a nice day.

354
00:49:11,975 --> 00:49:14,283
Come on ! Oh Lady !

355
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,939
Come on ! Hurry !
What's it ?

356
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,102
Come on, Come on !

357
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:43,939
Hey ! How're you doing ?

358
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:27,077
Very tempting.

359
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:36,080
Here he goes now.

360
00:50:38,088 --> 00:50:40,396
Mr. Bodyguard.

361
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:42,011
Yeah...
- This is Gamble. Target is still viable.

362
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,073
Any laundry ?
- One load. It's in room 302.

363
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:49,075
Where are you ?
- Yorkdale lnn.

364
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,515
Will pick up you in 15 minutes.

365
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:02,041
I need a van rolling. Yorkdale Inn.
Room 302.

366
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:08,279
What happened ?
Gamble loses our reputation ?

367
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,438
It happens.

368
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:16,565
It didn't go.

369
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:42,536
He was awakened by a kiss.
- Only fools ...

370
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:46,051
What really woke the princess
Sleeping Beauty up ?

371
00:54:46,226 --> 00:54:49,221
He woke her and took off.
- You're sick

372
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:52,221
9 months later still asleep,
she gave birth to twins.

373
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,781
One of them looking for nipple
to milk sucked the spinning finger

374
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:58,502
got the needle out from
her finger...So she woke up.

375
00:54:58,547 --> 00:55:01,102
You should get yourself fixed.
She never had kids...

376
00:55:04,472 --> 00:55:08,545
Ok. What do you want to watch ?
"Beauty and the Beast" or "Jungle books" ?

377
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:14,066
Maxi wants to see this one!.
- A spy movie ? Where did this come from ?

378
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:18,673
Eli gave it! She says
Sean Connery is a buff !

379
00:55:18,997 --> 00:55:21,588
A buff ?
Buff.... ?

380
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,076
Mommy are you a spy ?

381
00:55:24,138 --> 00:55:28,676
No mommy is not a spy and Max
and you should see Cinderella.

382
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:33,431
Hellow. Castle. Castle or Max
...Hellow?

383
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:28,372
Come in.

384
00:56:29,663 --> 00:56:34,323
Got the report Sir. We are just
finishing up with Holden's body now.

385
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:38,216
Castle, when was the last
time you saw the bodyguard ?

386
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:40,716
When I dropped him off at his hotel .

387
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:45,673
Let me know if you hear from him.
He is wanted for questioning.

388
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,396
Is that all, Mr. PutIey?
- Yes.

389
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,669
Hey, Castle.

390
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,669
From where did you get that?
Are you crazy ?

391
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,000
Cardboard, scissors, photobooth ...
Fine in a class, but a little tough !

392
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,158
You've identified the sniper ?
The real one ?

393
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,990
This case is closed Mr. Bishop.
- Oh really ?

394
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,590
Agent Castle !

395
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,030
Hi ! Mr ToIIander...Shouldn't you
be on a plane back to Langley ?

396
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,793
I'd love to ! But I heard Bishop
whacked somebody last night !

397
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,232
I want him for that.
- You're not authorised to act domestically.

398
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,232
Ah ! Well...that's the beauty
of Code Red operations !

399
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,232
No ! It's not Code Red !
Don't let me tell someone !

400
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,470
You are threatening me,
aren't you Agent ?

401
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,914
Do I need to ?
- Let me give you some advise !

402
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,175
Mikey Bishop is a contract
killer out of control.

403
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,272
I suggest that if you hang a
little while with him, he will

404
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,272
whack your body armour...
becuase anybody he uses...

405
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,913
....ends up dead !
Have a nice day !

406
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,428
No one uses me.

407
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,428
Someone tried to hide
me in ice last night.

408
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,110
They were professionals.

409
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,828
They have access to
"Keener Kleener" crew.

410
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,828
No lables on the clothes.
Everything untraceable !

411
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,358
And you think they were sent by
Trent's killer ? Now it's a conspiracy ?

412
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,614
I hadn't been long enough in
the town to piss up anybody else !

413
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,714
Don't underestimate yourself.

414
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,648
So what do you think ?

415
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,148
Whatever I think I think that solving this
case makes me look like everybody is a hero.

416
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,271
I know there is a big difference between
closing a case and solving it !

417
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,300
Don't give me that crap !
Only thing you close is coffins !

418
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,600
I read your file Mr. Bishop !

419
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,951
What did you do for the Naval Intelligence
that was too 'hot' for official record ?

420
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,814
3 Years and no record ?

421
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,514
What did I do ?
Everything they told me to !

422
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,075
What do they offer you for
closing down this case, Castle ?

423
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,875
Promotion ?

424
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,731
And what do you think that you
get with that ? Respect ?

425
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,879
Security. Does that
disappoint you Mr. Bishop ?

426
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:43,479
If it dares tell me how many daughters you
can raise out of that travelling bag of yours

427
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,638
None ! So do not lecture me, unless
you can reach into that bag

428
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,238
and pull out hair braces or

429
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,109
house with a back yard to swing a
set of fucking chop of birthday cake !

430
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,876
How long do you think you
can play by the rules ?

431
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,976
This isn't a game !

432
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,352
I'm the one who has to go home every single
night and look my little girl on the face

433
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,874
Alright ! You go ahead. Collect
your dirty pieces of silver.

434
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,354
Hand over the gun, Bishop !
- Excuse me ?

435
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,313
I said hand over the gun !

436
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,356
Now this is going to be a habit.
- Yeah, one I'm tired of too.

437
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:26,152
All I need is a video enhancer !
- Where did you get that ?

438
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,990
Bank machine.

439
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,238
You busted into an automatic teller
machine ? I'm a law officer, Bishop !

440
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,870
Then act like one insted of
a god damn politician !

441
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,993
Thank you.

442
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:51,000
That's about the time of hit. And that's
the snap he's going in the backyard.

443
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,635
To the next frame.

444
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,270
Keep going.

445
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,996
Keep going.

446
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,788
What is him ? What is wrong ?

447
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,278
Jason Jarvis Sherwood,
Appeared to be trained from 1974-1976.

448
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,918
Special forces 76,
till his retirement in 83.

449
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,792
Then he went freelance. Confirmed hits...
-...Abdul Komhani, Iranian Secret Police.

450
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,592
Karl Borgan, Uranium Technology Dealer.
Happie Albert, American Oil refiner.

451
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,636
You know him ?

452
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,709
Sherwood was the reason I spent
three years in the hospital.

453
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,709
I need to make call,
You have a quarter ?

454
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah ?
- Professor, it's Bishop.

455
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,473
No more riddles. I want to know the
connection between Tollander and Trent ?

456
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,508
Bosnia. You remember Michael.
You were there !

457
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,555
Trent financed the terrorists.

458
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,755
Common knowledge !
But no one asked who was....

459
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:30,200
Who financed Trent ? The Agency ?
- What was there agenda, Michael ?

460
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,832
Every group, very person
has a socialising agenda

461
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,794
The hostages were Serbian officers.
They used be trusted by the Muslims.

462
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,032
Not the type of people we
usually go into rescue.

463
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,239
There was no rescue mission.
- Very good Michael ! Not the first time

464
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:53,071
Tollander had tried liquidating
an embarrassment, as I well know.

465
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,078
I'll be outside.

466
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,278
You think Tollander put you
in that wheelchair Professor ?

467
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,030
I wouldn't be surprised to
find out this case.

468
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:06,430
Sherwood was his triggerman
for a long before today.

469
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,997
Call an ambulance!

470
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,909
Where is Sherwood?

471
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:20,356
Castle... Castle... No Castle, it'll
be alright. Nice and easy... Breath...

472
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,038
You'll be alright Castle...
Nice and easy... alright, breathe

473
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,556
You'll be alright, You'll be alright !
Nice and easy !

474
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,072
I feel like being hit
by a sledgehammer.

475
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,709
Yeah ! I know the feeling !

476
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,039
I have an address for us !

477
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,273
A problem..... Gentlemen... is
that your thinking...is very bad

478
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,553
How the hell do you think
we should think?

479
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,553
Not like fucking amateurs !

480
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,155
Fuck you my boy !

481
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,668
If you want Bishop and the woman,
you have to make them come to you !

482
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,838
Sherwood... It's me.

483
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,236
It's better be fucking important.

484
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,352
To put this gate !
- Yes, put it here.

485
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,552
Hey, Norm.
- What have we got ?

486
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,077
I want snipers covering this
back alleyway here.

487
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,619
And killer zone from here to here.
- Castle. you got a problem.

488
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,319
I'll say when...

489
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,718
Oh Shit ! We've got to get them out of there !
- That's alright. I'll get two of my men !

490
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,232
Two of us in civils. We should go !
- Let's go.

491
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,512
Easy ! Easy !  It's probably
just the neighbor's cat again.

492
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,309
Honey ! Our car !
- What ?

493
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,309
Somebody is watching.
Don't look back at the house !

494
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,276
Check it out, do the watch still ?
- Yeah, Yeah !

495
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,833
Okay ! Shit ! Thank you for
a nice date !

496
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,793
Well ?
- Kids playing ball of hockey.

497
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:02,432
Are they still watching ? Are we clear ?
- We are clear.

498
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,400
No. Okay !

499
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,229
How are we ? Are we clear ?
- Yeah.

500
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,230
Guys ! Get out of here !
Fast ! Go !

501
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,591
Go ! Go ! Go !

502
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,755
It's the party time ! Cover the door !
Putley in safety ! Give me the gas mask !

503
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,115
Come on ! Come on !

504
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,434
Move it ! Move it !

505
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,715
Get up ! On your feet !
Move !

506
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,838
Get moving ! Get moving !

507
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,798
Damn !

508
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,239
No ! No ! Please !

509
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,153
Put the gun away or
I'll snap her neck !

510
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,438
Put it away !

511
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,840
Come on ! Come on !

512
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,756
No ! No !
Stay down !

513
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,953
Stand up fucker !
Stand up !

514
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,828
Put her down !
- Come on honey !

515
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,476
Take your shot Castle.
- I can't. I don't have a clear shot !

516
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,554
Shoot me, CastIe!
- Look out !

517
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,759
Shit !

518
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,710
Damn !

519
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,713
Should've taken the shot.
Come on !

520
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,751
There are a couple of
gentlemen flying down from

521
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,751
Washington to talk
to you Mr. Putley !

522
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,276
Good ! I'll brief them of your
abuse of authority.

523
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:38,476
Your disregard for the chain
of command. They'll be ....

524
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,719
overjoyed to hear that you orderd a raid
on one of the Bureau's own safe houses !

525
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,279
Or you were protecting a
known contract killer.

526
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,279
I was holding Sherwood in custody !

527
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,388
Now I'm holding you Sir !
- I couldn't trust your abilities....

528
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,272
as an investigator. Your ambition
was getting in the way....

529
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,353
My ambition ? Is that why you
assigned me to this ?

530
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:06,753
That's not the only reason, Louise.

531
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,158
You're fucked !

532
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,330
Incompetent bastard, isn't he ?

533
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,830
That's not the only reason.
It sounds like a threat !

534
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,316
He doesn't have anything
to threaten me with.

535
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,910
Call home, Lou.

536
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,830
Max wants to play a game.
- Would Max like some pop-corn too ?

537
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,211
Yeah. With cheese !

538
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,711
Ok you pick a game. I'll go
and get some pop-corn.

539
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,911
Hello?

540
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,476
Come on baby !
Pick up.

541
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,193
Come on ! Pick up baby !

542
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,072
Let's go.

543
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,479
Agent Castle ! I heard about
Putley. Congratulations !

544
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,679
Get out of my way, Tollander.

545
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,358
I also knew there was something
wrong about him.

546
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,915
I went along with you on this.
If I go down, you go down with me.

547
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,954
You're not going down.

548
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,191
You're going under a witness-
protection programme.

549
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,312
Credt card, driver's licence, social
security number. Whole your life.

550
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,111
Ahmed Bekbay ?
- The computer picks it. Not me.

551
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,555
Sign up or sign off.
I won't make this offer again !

552
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,272
You're a prick, Tollander.

553
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,948
Come on now, Gord.

554
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,095
After you're transferred to
my custody, Mr. Hickey.....

555
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,895
...will take you anywhere
you want to go !

556
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,399
Thanks for no thanks !

557
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,875
Enjoy it.

558
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,277
Tollander !
- Yeah.

559
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,836
Bastard.
- Yes I am.

560
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,197
Very good, Mr. Hickey.
Very nice !

561
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,832
You know where the files are.

562
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,279
Mr Hickey...
Once this is over I want you to...

563
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,640
destroy Mr. Sherwood and his.....
personal effects.

564
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,277
No ! Wait !

565
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,238
Bend ! Bend her !

566
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,231
Bend her !
- I read in a book....

567
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,599
Don't shoot lady !

568
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,877
You bastards, where's my daughter ?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

569
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,394
Then you're of no use to
me whatsoever.

570
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,432
Castle... we're gonna find her.

571
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,992
Fuck you ! Fuck you !

572
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:41,752
We want Bishop. New
Highway 9, Side Road 7.

573
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,592
They got my daughter, and
I'll trade her for you !

574
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,511
You'll be set up.
Understand how they think.

575
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,037
They're using your
daughter as a pawn.

576
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:14,792
You and, Sherwood and Tollander
You all are the same.

577
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,112
Killing me solves their problem.

578
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,677
You won't get Melissa back.

579
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,595
Found this in the evidence room.
It's from the safe house.

580
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,349
Tollander was there with them.
I think he and Sherwood are in it.

581
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:53,632
Trent was working for the Agency,
And when he went out of...

582
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,832
...control it was Tollander's
job to eliminate him.

583
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,749
And they used Elliot Holden to
disguise it as a crime of passion.

584
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,949
Got anything up the shit yet ?

585
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,709
This game started a long time ago.

586
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,878
We're getting close. Slow down.

587
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:15,439
Don't hesitate this time. If you get
the chance, take the shot !

588
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,713
MichaeI, I...

589
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,329
Hey look. If we live,
you can bake me a cake !

590
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:28,629
If we live, no alternative
to arrest your ass !

591
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,628
Agent CastIe! PutIey finally cracked
and the Agency found your daughter !

592
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,556
Whatever !

593
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,918
CastIe ! No !
Wait !

594
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:09,390
MeIissa !
- Mommy ? Mommy ?

595
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,388
Come here ! I got you !
I got you !

596
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:19,118
Hold on to me Okay. Put your legs
around me. Hold on !

597
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,590
I'm afraid !
- You're gonna be ok sweetie !

598
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,000
Opening a door or a window will
create a hell of a blast !

599
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:54,000
This one is wired too.

600
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:59,718
Mr Bishop ! You played
an excellent game !

601
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,108
Nice come back from Bosnia !

602
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,439
How many times did I shoot you ?
- Seven !

603
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,994
Lucky seven ! Ouch !

604
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,792
Mommy !
- It's okay !

605
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,158
Disappointment Bishop !

606
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,152
I didn't think you'd succumb
to such desperation !

607
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,394
You're dead now !

608
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,757
Michael !

609
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,160
We're going out through the basement.

610
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,756
Kill the light, Castle.

611
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,189
Get down !

612
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,192
Come on ! Let's go, let's go !
- Come here, Come here, I got you !

613
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,756
Let's go, CastIe, come on !

614
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,755
I'll go down first !
Then I'll get her !

615
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,597
Did you catch her ?
Watch your head !

616
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,195
Hold on to Mike Okay.
Watch your head.

617
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,114
It was fun so long as it lasted !

618
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,839
Are you okay, Melissa ?

619
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,150
Are you all right ? Let me see.
Keep your eyes shut.

620
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,955
Okay.

621
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,710
Got him !
Fuck !

622
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,932
Mommy, he said a bad word ?

623
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,232
Listen to elsewhere
right now sweetie !

624
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,232
Bishop, nail the fucker !

625
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,391
Bishop ?

626
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,234
One Mississippi...

627
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,195
Two Mississippi...

628
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,158
Nice try though.
-Three Mississippi...

629
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,258
Ouch....

630
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,790
I thought the queen was Susan Trent ?

631
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:11,392
Classic Mr. Blacksheep.
What finally tipped you ?

632
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:17,240
Bosnia. Assassination acted
like a rescue mission !

633
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,071
When you mentioned Sherwood's
name I knew for certain.

634
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,671
Aside from Castle and myself....

635
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,232
the only people who knew
Sherwood was involved

636
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,432
was those who were inside
the conspiracy !

637
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,592
You decided to hit on Trent too.
- Suggested dear !

638
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,115
Crippled old cronies aren't allowed
to do more than....

639
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:40,115
...suggest, submit, recommend.

640
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:46,478
You wanted Tollander because you
think that he put you in that chair !

641
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,737
Trent and Sherwood ?

642
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:51,237
Three of them cut me out
a very lucrative business.

643
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,534
You knew I would trace this
back to you Simon !

644
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:57,034
Why set yourself up like that ?

645
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,195
Come, Michael !
Haven't you figured it out yet ?

646
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:12,749
I am sick, Michael
...Sick of these people !

647
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:18,871
Sick of myself, sick of
what's left of my soul !

648
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,953
I want to end all this !

649
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:28,031
And you my dear... my favourite
of my children instruments...

650
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,872
...my dark angel !

651
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:47,835
You have to do it, Michael ! For
the woman, Castle knows too much !

652
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,031
You have no choice, Michael !

653
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:56,831
Or I'll design a play to take
her and her daughter out !

654
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,680
You can't escape !

655
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,829
We both are made from the same
bloody mould Michael !

656
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,231
The pawn. How dissatisfied !

657
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,790
You're free forever now !

658
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:11,278
I won't be a target !
I'm staying on the board !

659
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,115
Let's go and see my daughter.
Bishop would you drive pelase ?

660
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,319
Son of a bitch who put him on that
chair should have done a better job !

661
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,754
I wish I had....!
