1
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,808
It's not around here.

2
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:34,048
But if you get close enough,
to do what you want.

3
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:38,088
It will kill anyone within five meters.

00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:45,248
Porch, but for your information,
it's a porch not a Ferrari.

6
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:53,248
And the blonde says: "For your information,
it's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari."

7
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:58,688
Yeah, right.

8
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:01,048
<i> We should have around
11.00 afternoon headlines. </i>

9
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:04,808
Are we looking for dinner, who's online?
- One second, Martha.

10
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:06,608
Are you coming along?
- I am.

11
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,168
Are you sure?
- I promised.

12
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:10,848
I'll send you a car, ok.

13
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,368
Asshole.

14
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,648
How you doing?
Going to the Barton building.

15
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,328
You know where is that right?
Course, you know.

16
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:03,608
This is gonna be boring.

17
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:09,088
Maybe not, I think there's an
entertainment.

18
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:18,928
..keep falling right? We need
to buy if it's gonna fall

19
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:19,808
Do you understand?

20
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,368
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
This steel's my fiance.

21
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:27,008
Listen, just do what I asked you ok?
I'll see you 9.00am tomorrow

22
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,168
Have it on my desk.

23
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,328
Hello, darling.

24
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,288
How's your work, darling?
- It was busy and I missed you.

25
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,248
I missed you too, where we go?
- Elevator A.

26
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:37,128
Thank you. How are you?
- I'm good.

27
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,968
Jack.
Barton comin' tonight?

28
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,848
You don't know?

29
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:43,848
He don’t know.

30
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,368
Good evening.
- Good evening.

31
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,448
Photo ID?

32
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,128
Seriously?

33
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:01,168
Donald Handy?
- Handley.

34
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,688
'Handy Man'.

35
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,488
Sorry, Mr. Handley.

36
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,568
And Miss Assana. You're the reporter.
I've seen you on TV.

37
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,488
Thank you for watching.
- I believe everything you say.

38
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:15,568
Can we go in now?
- Yes, please. Have a good time.

39
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,488
Thank you.

40
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,608
Darling, no need to get jealous.

41
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,608
He was undressing you with the time.

42
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,888
What's up, man?
- Good evening.

43
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:27,128
Hi, Martin Gossling.

44
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,328
It's done.
- Thanks.

45
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:38,048
Thank you.
- Welcome.

46
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:41,648
Hi Don.

47
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:44,608
Hi Martin, a little snack?

48
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,248
I did. Why?

49
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,848
Oh, sorry, I just got lunch.

50
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,728
Martin, this is my
gorgeous fiancee Maureen.

51
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,408
Hello, nice to meet you.

52
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,568
You're a lucky man.
- Yeah, indeed.

53
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:59,528
Pleasure.
- Pleasure to meet you, Martin.

54
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:04,128
I'm sorry, I'm a little sweaty.
My palms are...

55
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,008
I'm nervous.

56
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,928
Why you nervous about?

57
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:13,608
It's silly..ehm, hey Martin I heard that
Barton is actually showin' up tonight.

58
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:16,528
Bullshit, I work here 3 years and
I've never actually seen him, man.

59
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,968
No no no, tonight there's
to be an announcement.

60
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:20,888
What is that announcement?
<i>- 5 pm!</i>

61
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:25,608
Sweety, I didn’t have time.
Yes I got it. Toilet paper.

62
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,448
I'm on it, Ok bye.

63
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,728
Hi, George Axelrod. I'm taking
a Bob Berris's place

64
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,088
He's sick, I'm a comedian.

65
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:40,128
Right, got you here Mr. Axelrod, welcome.
- Thank you.

66
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,808
I don’t hear that very often.

67
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,648
Oh hey, listen, I'm a
borderline claustrophobic.

68
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:48,488
So if you could not stuff people...on, thanks.

69
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,408
I'll try.

70
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:54,648
When we started asking terrorists
for protection?

71
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:04,288
I'm a security guard.
- Yea, that's what they all say.

72
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,328
Hey Bin Laden, I'm joking.
Terrorist that no sense of humor.

73
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,968
Murphy, would you
please assist this lady?

74
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,888
Do you need help, ma'am?

75
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:20,128
Can't sure what's you're offering

76
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:24,048
Well, I can get you safely to
the party safe and sound.

77
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,728
May I have your name?
- Jane Redding.

78
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:34,288
Redding, that name
sounds familiar.

79
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,448
Oh, well, could be.

80
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:42,008
Excuse me.
- Hello.

81
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,088
Good evening, everyone.
- Photo ID?

82
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,768
Don’t be an idiot.

83
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:48,688
He's doing his job, sweety.

84
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,688
There's way too many people.
<i>- Don, that's him, that's him, that's Barton.</i>

85
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:58,568
Henry and Madeline Barton.
<i>- That's...that's Henry Barton.</i>

86
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:01,008
I don’t give a fuck,
there's regulation.

87
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,048
No, I don’t have your name, sir.

88
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,128
Why don’t you try looking at
the outside of the building?

89
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,568
He owns the place.

90
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,408
I'm sorry.

91
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,528
They told me to ID everyone, so...
- No, you're doing a good job

92
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,488
Don't wanna let in just any bereave.

93
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,928
Am I allowed ?
- It's very crowded.

94
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,928
We'll be fine, thank you.
- Now we're above...

95
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,608
...legal capacity.

96
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,368
Mr. Barton, Don Handley...

97
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:30,528
Intermediate bonds.
- Oh, good to meet you.

98
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:34,528
Miss Assana, I'm a big fan.

99
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,928
Pleasure to meet you.

100
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,728
Don thinks you're God.

101
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,808
Well, oh my a
slight exaggeration.

102
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,568
And who's your lovely date?
- Oh, this is my granddaughter Madeline.

103
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,528
Hello, Madeline, I love your outfit.

104
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:51,168
Why would we get old elevator?

105
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,888
We're with friends, sweetheart.
- Way too many people.

106
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:58,048
Barton, I'm Gossling,
High Mutual.

107
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:02,128
I know your name,
keep up the good work.

108
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:03,368
Thank you.

109
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,848
And who's this young lady?

110
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,248
Jane Redding, investor.

111
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:13,248
Oh, can't live without them.
Thank you for coming.

112
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,848
Good to finally meet you.
- George Axelrod, claustrophobic.

113
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,528
Look if we don’t get this thing move,
I'm gonna throw up.

114
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:23,088
Sorry, have a good time.

115
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:29,448
Wait, wait, wait.....
Celine Fouquet.

116
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:31,528
ID please.
- I'll vouch for her.

117
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:34,048
For Christ's sake, we're full.
- There's room for one.

118
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:37,448
Thank you so much.
We're those two of us, right?

119
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:41,768
You are Henry Barton.
- Uh yes, good to meet you both.

120
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,408
Maybe we should
take turns breathing.

121
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,408
You're okay, Madeline?

122
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:34,448
Someone smells bad.

123
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:37,048
Won't be long.

124
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:49,248
I'm so sick...
- Oh, I'm sorry about pushing you.

125
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,448
Aren't you cozy
in here tonight ?

126
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:55,128
<i>I'm not feeling that great</i>

127
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:58,128
Take a deep breath.
-It's too many people here.

128
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,928
What if we get stuck?

129
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,768
What's wrong with him?

130
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,648
He's claustrophobic.

131
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:09,408
He doesn’t like small spaces.

132
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:10,568
Can he die?

133
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,488
He'll be fine.

134
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:20,368
Hey, hey man look, I've been taking this
elevator every day, ten times a day.

135
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:25,808
We all have. For six years,
and its never once got stuck.

136
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:29,608
It's like my worst nightmare.
- You must have.

137
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:06,808
Don’t !

138
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,328
She just pressed the stop button.

139
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,008
It was an accident, Grandpa.

140
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:16,928
It was an accident.
Say you're sorry, Madeline.

141
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:19,008
Sorry.
- She did it on purpose.

142
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,888
She was looking right down and then she pressed it.
- You're lying.

143
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,768
I saw you.
- Liar!

144
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:29,128
Evil little bitch !
I know what I saw.

145
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:34,488
Mr. Axelrod, you're fired.
- Fine, I don’t give a fuck.

146
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:37,768
Just get me out of here.
Let me take the stairs.

147
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:49,328
Jesus, not moving.

148
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:55,128
Maybe you should try not to breathe
like that cos you're going to pass out.

149
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:03,088
Sir, you need to pull out
the stop button.

150
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:14,808
It's not moving.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck I knew it.

151
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,968
Please watch your language.
There are women and children here.

152
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,608
My language?
Do you hear he's worried about my language.

153
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,208
We're hanging here, squeezed
like a fucking sardines

154
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,368
54 floors up and my
language is the problem?

155
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,288
I bet language is not the problem,
when you blown people up.

156
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:34,088
Did I miss something?
- There must be a phone or intercom or..something

157
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:39,248
Let's try going down.
Maybe it will reset.

158
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,608
That was promising.

159
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:54,608
Who are you texting?
- Martha. I'm telling her we're stuck.

160
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:58,048
Which she'll love it.
- She's gonna make a documentary about it.

161
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:06,088
Oh, Man.
- Hey pal, its ok, this probably just a glitch.

162
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:08,768
How the hell would you know?
You said we never get stuck.

163
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,528
Technically, we're stopped.
- Do you wanna try the intercom there?

164
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,008
I mean, I'm sure someone's on
duty and get this thing moves.

165
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:20,408
Sometimes this thing just need
a little jiggling to free them up.

166
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:26,088
Great, the battery's dead.

167
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,608
I'm hungry.
- We'll be there soon.

168
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:56,488
I can't breathe.
- Look at here.

169
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:59,088
See if this would help?
- What is it?

170
00:15:59,128 --> 00:16:04,208
Irish whiskey.
My husband taught me to be prepared.

171
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,648
Hey, I don’t really think that's the best idea.
- Your idea's suck.

172
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,448
Sir, I think we should try
the intercom.

173
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:15,128
Alright, we depend on the experts.

174
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,168
<i>Security</i>

175
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:23,488
It's a Henry Barton, our elevator
seems to be stuck...

176
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:28,368
The 49th floor.
<i>- Have you try punching the lobby?</i>

177
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:31,768
It dropped a couple of feet, then
stopped again, it wont move at all now.

178
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:35,288
<i>Did anyone push the
emergency stop button?</i>

179
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:40,288
Yes, but I pulled it out again,
it was an accident.

180
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>That can't happen.</i>
- I've told you.

181
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:47,608
<i>The emergency button is for emergencies only.</i>
- Are you listening?

182
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,448
<i>Nothing to play with.</i>

183
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:50,848
Just fix it.

184
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:55,008
We're late for our party.
<i>- I'll call maintenance.</i>

185
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:18,928
It's exact to be...you've got
2 hours to go you need to be.

186
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:24,128
Wherever you are, it's gonna go off.

187
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:28,048
The mechanism can't be stopped.

188
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:34,608
You sure this is what you wanna do?

189
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:51,768
I hope it won't too much longer.
Ever since I've been pregnant...

190
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:54,528
I have to pee every ten minutes.

191
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,528
I remember being like that too.

192
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:02,368
My sister's pregnant.
She's go bad after raddled.

193
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:07,728
I'm sorry about all this.
- Mr. Barton, it's not your fault.

194
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,648
Don’t know where it'd go.

195
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,968
It's my building.
- It's your granddaughter.

196
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,648
It was an accident.
- Liars go straight to hell.

197
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,048
That's enough, Mr. Axelrod.
- What you're doing? Get fire me again?

198
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,088
Go ahead, fire me as many time as you want.
Wasn't for her, we won't be here.

199
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,768
Is that you?
- Excuse me.

200
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,288
It's my producer, Martha.

201
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:38,248
If we start to eat each other, she
wants it on the 11 O'clock news.

202
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:41,848
I've heard people getting
stuck on elevator for days.

203
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:45,448
Feels like we've been
here a week already.

204
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,688
Hasn't been 10 minutes.

205
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:55,288
Sir, I suggest you stop doing that.
It may interfere what maintenance is doing.

206
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:07,008
I hate miss the first course.
Thai mussel crab.

207
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:08,888
Suppose to be amazing.

208
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,608
Sounds delicious.

209
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,808
Now I'm in a hurry.

210
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:18,328
Well, since we all becoming
a...elevator family, ehm...

211
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:21,288
Mr. Barton, I have a question.

212
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,528
Go ahead.

213
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,968
Well, I heard a rumor...

214
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:31,048
Mr. Barton, are you retiring?
- I don't believe it.

215
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,968
Well, with a 75 million dollars payout...

216
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,368
Why would you want
to keep working?

217
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:40,568
75 million dollars?

218
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,848
<i>That's obscene</i>.

219
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:46,648
No, no, it's a...just a figure,
the.. paper's cooked up.

220
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:52,328
But just between us,
my elevator family, I'm retiring...

221
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:55,128
I'm announcing it tonight.
- Why?

222
00:19:55,168 --> 00:20:01,088
Maybe the energy the, there are a lot of
talented people who can take my place.

223
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:03,888
I'm going to consult, but...

224
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:07,568
want some time to relax
with my family.

225
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,248
You can afford it.

226
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,568
I've worked hard all my life.

227
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,248
Who hasn’t?

228
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:19,448
75 million, Christ.

229
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:22,288
I'm starving.

230
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:32,528
Well, if it's alright with your
grandfather, you can have this.

231
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:37,008
Thank you.
Say thank you, Madeline.

232
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:40,648
It's got nuts.
I can't eat nuts.

233
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:46,008
Nuts.

234
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,168
Has anyone seen that
old film  'Lifeboat' ?

235
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,768
Don’t they eat someone in that?

236
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:54,928
We're starting people, I've
got dim sum and Miss Assana.

237
00:20:54,928 --> 00:21:00,248
Watch your line, smart-ass.
-Hey I only say what every guy's thinking.

238
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:04,048
Right Mohammed?
- It won't get that far.

239
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:08,208
George, can I have the flask?

240
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:11,328
Please, thank you.

241
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,928
Oh, thank you

242
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:31,128
Old age ain't for sissies.
That's Betty Davis said.

243
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,608
You're not old.
- No.

244
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:38,248
They say you're as old as you feel.
- Are you from New York?

245
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:41,168
Cleveland.
- Came all this way for a party?

246
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:45,288
Ah sure, why not? I haven't been
to New York since my honeymoon

247
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,248
that was 43 years ago.

248
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,808
Your husband didn't
come with you.

249
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:55,008
My husband's died a few months ago.

250
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,808
Oh well, I'm sorry to hear that.

251
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:04,008
He certainly would've wanted to come tonight.
Especially to meet you, Mr. Barton.

252
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:09,648
I'm sure he's a wonderful man.
- Yes, he was, he's the best.

253
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:12,568
How much longer that we
have to stay in here?

254
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,688
Not more, not more.

255
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:21,488
My wife.
We're stuck in the elevator.

256
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:26,528
<i> - Great, how about Madeline?</i>
She's fine, she's fine.

257
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:30,208
<i>- What should I do with everybody?</i>
Just start without us.

258
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,848
We'll be there soon.
<i>- Hurry.</i>   All right.

259
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:42,408
I suppose they...have to
call the elevator people.

260
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:46,928
Security guard, you wanna
get on your walkie talkie

261
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:49,368
maybe get your
team to help us?

262
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,768
Didn’t you hear me earlier
my battery's dead.

263
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,888
I'm not surprised.
- What did you say?

264
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:59,288
I said I'm not surprised.

265
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:01,168
There isn't much more I can do

266
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:06,408
than what Mr. Barton is already doing, ok?
- So Don I hear you're getting married.

267
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,848
When is the big day?

268
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,568
March.

269
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:16,928
I'm a lucky girl.
I'm Maureen by the way.

270
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,968
I've seen you on TV. I'm Celine.
Its really nice to meet you...

271
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:24,088
Don has been
keeping you a secret.

272
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:26,128
How do you know Don?

273
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:29,608
Oh, from bonds. I'm on
maternity leave right now.

274
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,608
But I didn’t want to miss this.

275
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,488
So you're working in
the same department?

276
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:37,928
Yep, yea side by side.

277
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:42,288
Why you didn’t say hello?
- Hello, Celine.

278
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:46,168
You look lovely tonight.
- Thank you very much.

279
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:50,208
We're actually..we don’t work
together that much anymore.

280
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:53,728
That's enough tho, right Don?

281
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:58,568
Are you okay?
<i>- Yea...</i>

282
00:23:58,768 --> 00:23:59,848
Okay?

283
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,088
Do you have enough room there?

284
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,368
Anybody else?
- Once you're offering.

285
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:19,248
Oh good yeah, more drinking.

286
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:28,968
Do they forgot about us?

287
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,088
Not when you're with the boss.

288
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,648
Depends what kind of boss.

289
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:38,208
Let's see if they're
making any progress.

290
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,368
<i>Security.</i>
- This is Henry Barton.

291
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:44,688
We're still stuck in the elevator.
Did you find the problem?

292
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:48,408
<i>Looks like the brake's jammed,
maintenance contacted the elevator people.</i>

293
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:50,688
How long that's going to take?
<i>- Well, they're on their way...</i>

294
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:54,248
<i>But there is a traffic problem.</i>
<i>A pile upon the tunnels.</i>

295
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:56,888
<i>It's gonna take a little longer.</i>
- Why didn’t you call them in the first place?

296
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:00,768
<i>It has to go through maintenance.</i>
- Let me speak to someone from maintenance.

297
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:03,928
<i>They are not here at the moment.</i>
- Where are they?

298
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:07,208
<i>The elevator technicians are on
their way. You need to be patient.</i>

299
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,128
What's your name?

300
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:12,208
Hello?

301
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,768
Hello !

302
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,768
Hello !!

303
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,328
The elevator people are coming.

304
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:26,768
I wanna go home.
- Me too.

305
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:33,088
George, since we are a captive audience,
why don’t you tell us a joke?

306
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:37,048
Yeah, we can use a laugh.

307
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:41,528
I'll tell you one I was working for tonight.
- Can not wait.

308
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,008
A banker's friend of mine...

309
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:47,528
hired a beautiful blonde,
to paint his porch.

310
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:50,568
So after about an hour,
he sees she's washing the brushes,

311
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:53,448
and he thinks "That's weird...

312
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:54,968
He'd figured it
would take all day.

313
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:57,048
You know, so he could invite
her in to... you know

314
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:01,288
..have lunch. And he looks at her
and says "Is everything okay?"

315
00:26:01,368 --> 00:26:04,488
And she looks at him with those big,
beautiful smile and says,'Oh, yea.'

316
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,848
He asks: "Are you done?"
and she says...

317
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,328
"Yea, it wasn't that big of a job and
for your information..."

318
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,888
It's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari.
- Thanks a lot, asshole.

319
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:17,008
Don, that's mean.
- Joke's got whiskers.

320
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:19,048
I...I found it was funny.

321
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:22,328
Right? Porch, Porsche...
- Yea, we got it, we got it.

322
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,488
Stupid.

323
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:27,048
Believe it or not,
I once opened for Dice Clay.

324
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,968
Still stupid.
- Yea, you're stupid.

325
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:34,448
Wow hey, how about a little
stand up to try sitting down?

326
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:38,288
If you skip the cupcake once in a while,
I might have enough room.

327
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,288
I hope you suffocate.

328
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:45,128
Where you from, Mohammed?

329
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:48,328
My family comes from Iran.

330
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,408
A moslem, I knew it.

331
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:55,928
Knew what? Because I'm moslem
I can be avoid in America?

332
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,248
You can be, it's possible,
but you are suspect.

333
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:00,088
And so because of
my family is Indian,

334
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:01,768
Doesn't mean that I've to
wear a dot on my forehead?

335
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:03,928
All I'm saying is it can't be ignored.

336
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:07,248
After 5000 years of suffering
I have a certain sensitivity.

337
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:09,528
A jew, of course.
- Hey man...

338
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:13,088
We know about your nuclear ambitions,
and we have you in the cross hair.

339
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,248
You're imbecile.
- I gotta go.

340
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,168
I'll follow you out.
- No, I really have to go, I have to pee.

341
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:22,328
I, I can't hold it any longer.
I thought I've been here in the restroom by now.

342
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,768
What you wanna do?

343
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:32,408
It's not that nice of a bag really.

344
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:35,888
What does your bag have to do?

345
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,048
Do you mind if I'll just squeezing
into this corner right here?

346
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:48,848
Where you really go.

347
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:49,608
Thank you.

348
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,728
Ok.

349
00:27:58,128 --> 00:27:59,808
Thanks.

350
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:02,048
Thank you.
- Here you go.

351
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,568
This is good, ehm...

352
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:11,448
Can I just, do me a favor, just hold your arm?
just to keep me up for a second?

353
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:14,528
You know, I'll just do it myself

354
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:17,288
I don’t wanna be doing here.
I promise.

355
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,888
How about...how about this?

356
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:29,488
Thanks, Martin.
- No problem.

357
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,328
Hey, no problem.

358
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:35,808
Thank you.

359
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:40,448
What she's doing? She can't do that
in here, make her stop Grandpa.

360
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:43,648
Don't look.
- There it is.

361
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:49,248
Never do when people watching.

362
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,528
Ew, I can hear it.

363
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,128
Well, its better than
pee on the floor, isn't it?

364
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:57,128
Now they're not answer them.

365
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,768
I can smell it.
- Be quiet.

366
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,928
I can't.

367
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:08,048
Okay, we're good. -Yeah?
We're good.

368
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:13,008
Oh good, I never care much
for my dignity anyway.

369
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:16,048
No, it's fine, it's fine...

370
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:24,848
I am so.. sorry about that everybody.
- No, it's fine, it's fine...

371
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:27,208
I really feel much...

372
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,408
much better now.

373
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:04,008
Our son Geoff died in Iraq.

374
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:11,448
Could someone help me up, please?

375
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:18,008
Thank you.

376
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:26,048
Our son Geoff died in Iraq.

377
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:36,088
They practically killed
my husband, Neill,...

378
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:40,488
He and Geoff very close, and...

379
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,368
He...

380
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,568
It basically took his spirit...

381
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:52,688
We were going to buy a boat,
when he retired.

382
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:58,688
He was always studying
these boat magazines.

383
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:02,288
That's what cut him through, really.

384
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:06,248
Didn't he get one?

385
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:14,448
Barton Investments
lost all of our money.

386
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,648
Redding, your husband Neill Redding?
- Yes.

387
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,568
Called me up 6 months ago,
he wanted his money back.

388
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:26,608
and he screamed at me
and said I've ruined his life.

389
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:29,128
Part those endeavor junk bonds from us.

390
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,248
Not we advice to our clients to bought,

391
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,288
No one could see what
was around the corner.

392
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,488
It's just one of those things.

393
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:38,368
My husband shot
himself in the head.

394
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:47,488
After my child, my son,
he was my whole life.

395
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:53,608
Really sorry, I mean no matter how much
that we know it's still just a gamble...

396
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,528
You can't blame me or...us.

397
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:02,848
He trusted you.

398
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:09,768
He trusted you, to do the right thing.
He trusted you...

399
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:15,968
Don't mean to sound careless, but
it's always the investor's decision.

400
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:22,808
And then I heard that you got
the 75 million dollars payout !

401
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,528
Sleazy bastards.

402
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,488
It wasn't fair.

403
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:30,368
Life isn't fair.

404
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:35,488
No,it isn't.
Life is shit.

405
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:39,168
So why are you here, Mrs. Redding?

406
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:45,248
If it were me, this is the last
place that I would wanna be.

407
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:12,048
I hope this is okay.

408
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:20,368
I give it back if you changed your mind.

409
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:23,528
I started the timer.

410
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,048
Thank you.

411
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:30,048
I'm....running out of time.

412
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:39,048
I just wanted to deliver a message.

413
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:47,248
I didn't know that the elevator
was going to be stuck.

414
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:51,808
What was the message?
- That's a...

415
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:58,168
Jane, what's wrong?
She needs help.

416
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:01,008
Jane?

417
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:04,608
Jane, breathe.

418
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,848
What's wrong?
- I think a heart attack.

419
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:13,568
She needs help.
- I'll call 911.

420
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:15,568
911.

421
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:19,128
Jane?

422
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:23,848
Help her ! Help her !

423
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,528
<i>911, What can I help you ?</i>

424
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:29,488
She...she can't breathe.

425
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,808
I don't wanna die in an elevator.
- Oh, you're not gonna die.

426
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:38,088
You're not gonna die.
- Believe she's having a heart attack.

427
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:40,928
<i>Ok, what is your location?</i>
- I have a bomb.

428
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:43,528
Did she just say she has a bomb?
<i>-Excuse me?</i>

429
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:46,008
She said she has a bomb.

430
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:48,808
<i>Who has a bomb?</i>
- The woman.

431
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:54,128
I don't think she's breathing.

432
00:34:56,848 --> 00:35:01,088
She's gone.
- You know maybe she has stroke?

433
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:08,288
I was medic in the army.

434
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:11,848
She's dead.

435
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:14,088
You tell them we need to
get out of here right now.

436
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,888
They need to fix this right now.
Tell them.

437
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,888
Cos we have a medic,
that's how we know.

438
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:21,648
Hello? Answer me...
- Redding...

439
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:23,608
Jane Redding.

440
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:25,688
We need help!

441
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:32,088
They're sending emergency services.

442
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:42,248
God damn it, where are these people.

443
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:50,608
Now they're not answering.

444
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:56,368
This is unacceptable, they have a job to do.
- You pissed them off, Henry.

445
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,048
We didn’t lose their money,
they've lost their own money.

446
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:02,168
We're not responsible for client's
decision. We facilitate it.

447
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:05,168
You got blood on your hand man,<i> -Shut up..</i>
throw me off the elevator.

448
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,768
This is ridiculous. Where this 70 years old
woman gonna get a bomb.

449
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,808
Her son died in Iraq...
- 70, maybe 70.

450
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:14,208
<i>Help me through it.</i> - I don't know.
<i>Tell me what you see.</i>

451
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:16,768
What she told us
we just met her.

452
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:18,848
She only said that...
<i>- How do you know she has a bomb?</i>

453
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,728
That what she said. Jane Redding
from Cleveland, just before she died.

454
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:24,168
<i>Have you called 911?</i>
- We're talking to 911 now.

455
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,768
What different does that make? 70, maybe 70.
-<i>This is big, can you stream on your phone?</i>

456
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,008
I'm fine.

457
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:33,048
I can do it, I'll start streaming.
-Well it's not obvious, a...

458
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:36,648
I don’t...if...
She has a purse.

459
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,528
Why don’t we check for bomb?

460
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:41,968
Its not to overreact.
We need to keep our wits.

461
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:44,608
Get the fuck here and do something.

462
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:49,048
There's 9 of us including CEO
Henry Barton and his granddaughter.

463
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,168
Really, with the camera?
- Minutes ago, Jane Redding...

464
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:57,328
An investor at Barton, died of a heart attack.
She told us she has a bomb.

465
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:02,088
There is no bomb. She was upset, because
an investment went wrong.

466
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:04,688
You see this sort of thing on the news.
-How Barton checks...

467
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,808
Because she's the one who after
him anyway.

468
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,528
You are a security guard,
it's your job.

469
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:11,088
I'm not trained for bombs.
There's experts for that.

470
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,848
You're the fucking
expert, so do it.

471
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:15,488
I'll check it.

472
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,928
Celine Fouquet, bond trader,
an expected mother...

473
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,488
has volunteered to check Redding
for any explosive device.

474
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:00,968
Am I just open it up, or...
- Yea.

475
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:05,128
It can't be so sensitive right? I mean
she's been carrying it around all night.

476
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:48,688
Damn it God, dammit.

477
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,008
Looks like there's a wallet in here.

478
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:26,048
How do you know it's just a wallet?
Maybe it does look like a wallet..

479
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:43,368
In case my camera didn't pick that up,
there's a huge sigh of relief.

480
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:45,688
There's no bomb?
- No bomb, sweety.

481
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:48,808
Mrs. Redding just had
a few problems, that's all.

482
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:53,048
Her husband just blew his brains out.
- Why do you insist on being so obnoxious?

483
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:57,288
My granddaughter's 10 years old.
Do you think she needs to hear that?

484
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:01,168
No any of us knows what happened to
Mr. Redding. She could've made it all up.

485
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,608
For all we know he could be sitting in
Queens and drinking a beer and watching TV.

486
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:07,368
Sounds good to me.

487
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:10,208
So we get this thing move,
I'm starving...

488
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:15,008
They lose their money
and homes and what do they do?

489
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,848
Oh, for God's sake.

490
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:20,448
It's a good job Celine.
What is that?

491
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:23,248
Neill Redding,
tragic victim of the collapsed economy.

492
00:40:23,328 --> 00:40:25,568
It says here that he shot himself.

493
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,328
So she wasn't making that up.

494
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:30,808
Happy now?

495
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:35,888
It doesn't mean anything.
Miss Fouquet checked her purse.

496
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,768
Wait, no, if that's true, then...

497
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:44,368
I think we..we should check under...

498
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:49,728
Under her dress, under her blouse,
Isn't that what they do?

499
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:56,688
How do I know what 'they' do.
I'm not a suicide bomber ok?

500
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:59,448
I don't know any suicide bombers.

501
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:02,568
I never touch or even seen
a real bomb in my life.

502
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:05,168
I'm an American, just like you.

503
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,048
Feel better now?

504
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,088
I asked, because you're in the army.

505
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:14,688
I am not taking her clothes off.

506
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:19,288
Okay, then just like a feel around,
like the police do.

507
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:22,608
I don’t have any experience
with what the police do, Martin.

508
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:25,328
We've learned a lot
about you, Martin.

509
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:28,088
No, look, just run your
hands over her body.

510
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:32,008
We gotta to find out.

511
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,088
Jesus Christ.

512
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:48,208
When did I starting grow balls ?

513
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:35,208
I don't know, there's something there.
- Are you joking'?

514
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,368
I'm not joking.

515
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:00,888
There's definitely something there.

516
00:43:15,048 --> 00:43:17,208
Look could be any..
- Or a bomb.

517
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:19,568
Stop saying that.
- Fire me.

518
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:34,328
We got to find out.

519
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:38,168
You are a very impressive
woman, Miss Fouquet.

520
00:43:49,288 --> 00:43:51,448
Stupid.

521
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:16,328
There is a bomb.

522
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:19,248
It's nice knowing you all.
- She's got a bomb?

523
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,968
We do not know what it is, sweety.
- It's not a satellite radio.

524
00:44:22,048 --> 00:44:24,848
It's a metal box,
the size of a bar of soap...

525
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:28,288
It's attached to what looks
like a bicycle cables.

526
00:44:29,048 --> 00:44:34,488
Martha, I'm gonna save my battery power
Just get them to hurry, we need help.

527
00:44:37,448 --> 00:44:40,248
Come help me.

528
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:44,128
I'll climb up here,
there's gonna be a hatch.

529
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,248
And then what?
There's nobody goes.

530
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:50,768
It's for fuck's sake, help me.
- This is desperate.

531
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,328
We are trapped here on with a
bomb, all right Mr. Barton?

532
00:44:54,368 --> 00:44:56,008
A bomb. It's all desperate.

533
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:01,888
Come on.
Do it.

534
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:09,488
I can't see anything.

535
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:27,688
Hold me .
- Yea.

536
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,568
It's just fucking lights.

537
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:40,488
The only elevator without
an escape hatch in this city?

538
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,648
And then now what?

539
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:45,528
Anyone have a deck of cards?

540
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:49,088
Nothing.

541
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:53,008
Wouldn’t do me
much good anyway.

542
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,048
Where we are here?

543
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:03,768
You shouldn't smoke.

544
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:09,608
The fuck do you care?

545
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:12,728
What now, you gonna become
a concerned father?

546
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,208
That's not what I meant.
There's just 9 of us...

547
00:46:16,328 --> 00:46:20,088
You shouldn't smoke.
That just...

548
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,048
Its all we're breathing this air.

549
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:24,608
What do you say? What she's talking about?
- You can tell it better.

550
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:27,128
It's not the time, all right?
I'll explain it later.

551
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:30,248
Perfect time to confess.
- Shut the fuck up.

552
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,968
Who? me?
- It's not the time all right?

553
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:37,928
I wanna know now.
- I'll explain it later, ok?

554
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:43,728
Man up Donnie, like when you put
me on your desk, remember that?

555
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:50,168
I'm so sorry. It was a mistake, alright,
We just spent so much time together.

556
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:54,528
You weren't home.
It just happened, I'm really sorry.

557
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:58,048
Is she carrying your child, Don?

558
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,528
Yeah, it's possible.

559
00:47:07,888 --> 00:47:09,208
I don't wanna die.

560
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:13,008
You're not gonna die, sweety.
No one's gonna die.

561
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:16,368
They're sending someone to get us out.
- Is that another guarantee, Henry?

562
00:47:16,488 --> 00:47:19,728
You are such an asshole.
- Yeah takes one with no one

563
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:25,928
You seems like you're enjoying all this.
- I'm a happy pessimist.

564
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:28,328
I'd expect the worst and
I'm never disappointed.

565
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:31,768
How do we know it's not a fake?
Maybe she did it just to scare us.

566
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:35,568
Why'd hide a fake bomb? The whole
reason have a fake bomb is to show it off

567
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:38,848
Maybe she's gonna show it at the party later,
Wouldn't that make more sense?

568
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:40,808
Can't be that easy to get
explosive material you can't just

569
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:44,248
walk into Wall-Mart and pick it up.
- Yes, it can be bought.

570
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,968
Oh...there, you heard it from the expert.
- Motherfucker !

571
00:47:47,008 --> 00:47:51,488
Stop it.
Just get back!

572
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,768
Fuck you!
- Hello.

573
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:04,088
No, it's okay.
It's just speculation.

574
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:11,288
No, honey,no I know.
She's alright, she's just..afraid.

575
00:48:11,928 --> 00:48:15,048
Want talk to grandma?
Here.

576
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,728
Hi Grandma.
<i>- Don't worry sweety.</i>

577
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:24,328
I know. I'm scared.
<i>- Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

578
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:27,208
<i>I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

579
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:34,688
No, they'd be here any seconds.

580
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:37,648
I promise.

581
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,928
I love you.

582
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:45,848
Everything's going to be fine....ok

583
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,968
<i>We interrupt this program with a special
news. Tonight, at the Barton building...</i>

584
00:48:57,048 --> 00:49:00,808
<i>9 people, including CEO Henry Barton
and his granddaughter...</i>

585
00:49:00,848 --> 00:49:04,888
<i>are trapped in a stuck elevator,
with what appears to be a bomb.</i>

586
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:07,808
<i>Our Maureen Assana is 1 of the
 9 people who trapped.</i>

587
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:11,368
<i>This is Maureen Assana for WRPGTB in New York.</i>

588
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:14,448
<i>I'm streaming from an elevator
 at the Barton building.</i>

589
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:18,288
<i>A few minutes ago, Jane Redding,
an investor with Barton...</i>

590
00:49:18,328 --> 00:49:21,128
<i>died of an apparent heart attack.</i>
<i>- No bomb.</i>

591
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:24,288
<i>She was upset, because an investment
went wrong. You see this...</i>

592
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,128
<i>We have no knowledge about
how much time we have left.</i>

593
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:30,328
<i>We need you to understand
the gravity of the situation.</i>

594
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:36,008
<i>The woman's dead. Barton should check.
she's the one who after him anyway.</i>

595
00:49:46,408 --> 00:49:49,688
Fuck this, alright let's get the
goddamn doors open alright.

596
00:49:57,168 --> 00:50:00,288
Come on.
- Don, what are you doing?

597
00:50:00,328 --> 00:50:01,528
Only one way out alright?

598
00:50:01,528 --> 00:50:04,128
You have no choice.

599
00:50:15,848 --> 00:50:17,848
Let's get these doors open,
come on !

600
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,648
Pull....

601
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:29,528
Shit, we can't get through of it.
- Somebody help us!

602
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:42,728
They evacuated the building
They had to.

603
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:47,528
What if we open it up and throw the bomb out?
- How? How you gonna get it off her?

604
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:49,928
I don't know alright, What if I climb up
and I hit the bomb on the outside.

605
00:50:49,928 --> 00:50:52,288
I mean, it's a different controller,
maybe its get stuck and it's not moving

606
00:50:52,288 --> 00:50:53,408
They're all in the same circuit.

607
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:56,368
How do you know, are you fucking elevator expert?
- I know how things work.

608
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:58,408
Ok smart ass, give me
your big idea, alright?

609
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:00,248
Cos I'm not gonna sit around
here and get fucking blown up

610
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,648
Sweety, you have to be brave, ok?

611
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:10,648
Don't cry.
Try not to cry, ok?

612
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:12,648
Try to be brave.

613
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:18,168
I think we should do it.
What we got to lose?

614
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,768
You guys love pushing buttons.

615
00:51:19,808 --> 00:51:23,248
You know, it's tighting the world works.
- Better than doing nothing.

616
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:26,648
Been on the phone with these people, ok?
Who knows when they're getting here?

617
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:28,928
We are on our own.

618
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:32,248
They have to come and the Bartons
is a big fucking deal right?

619
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:34,528
Off course is gonna be on TV, isn't it?

620
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:37,928
Yes, it is probably already on CNN now.
It's headline news.

621
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,448
You heard her.

622
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:42,328
She said we're home tonight, ok?
That means 2 things...

623
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:46,128
That means that the bomb
probably on a timer...

624
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:48,528
And that means we can not wait !

625
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:51,528
You guys help me get the door open alright?
Will you guys help me up there?

626
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,048
- Yes
Come on, come on !

627
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,968
Pull!

628
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:02,008
Pull!

629
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:04,048
Mohammed, you push me up?
- Yea...oh, shit!

630
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,648
What are the buttons?

631
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,848
Here we go.

632
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,448
I think I need someone to
help me with the buttons.

633
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:38,848
I can't reach it.

634
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:42,248
Here, use this my beloved.

635
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:45,368
Go again?
- Yeah, let's do it.

636
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:47,048
Come on, let's keep
these doors open alright?

637
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:03,928
Let's go again bro.

638
00:53:12,848 --> 00:53:15,448
Careful, it's dangerous.

639
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:19,928
Come on, I need you
to reach the cane.

640
00:53:24,528 --> 00:53:26,048
I got it...

641
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:30,928
Don't put your head out there.
- Just hold me.

642
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,128
This is time you'd be the hero.

643
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:44,648
Let's take a break.

644
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:47,128
Pull your hand back in.

645
00:53:52,928 --> 00:53:55,528
Good, good I'm closer.
Come on!

646
00:53:57,448 --> 00:53:59,328
Madeline, don't!

647
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,408
Holy shit...

648
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:49,128
It sounds just like
"<i>The Girl From Ipanema</i>".

649
00:54:52,328 --> 00:54:55,928
Don?
- What?

650
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:59,528
Just happened.
- Now I need the button.

651
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:01,728
Who else can hear me?

652
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:04,248
Is Don?
- Who else can hear me?

653
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:06,728
I'm here...
- Maureen?

654
00:55:06,728 --> 00:55:09,328
Yes.
- I'm here.

655
00:55:12,448 --> 00:55:15,848
Cellphones...
Use your cell phones.

656
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:19,128
Get one in my pocket.
I just need to reach it.

657
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:21,728
Ow, Get off me !
- I'm sorry.

658
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:24,288
Fuck!

659
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:33,128
George?

660
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,648
Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

661
00:55:35,648 --> 00:55:37,928
Sorry.
- Celine?

662
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,128
My leg hurts.

663
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,528
It'll be fine.
- Is it over?

664
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:50,448
Mr. Barton? Madeline?
Are you ok?

665
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,088
Are you ok baby?
- Where is Don?

666
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:57,768
Where is the light?
- Madeline next to me.

667
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:22,528
Help me, God.
- Please help him.

668
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:42,728
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be fine.

669
00:56:42,728 --> 00:56:44,328
I must stop the bleeding.

670
00:56:46,328 --> 00:56:49,528
Easy.
Hold on, hold on.

671
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,528
We're still here.

672
00:57:02,528 --> 00:57:07,048
That was very scary,
but we are all still there.

673
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:11,248
Henry, it's enough with the buttons.
You've reached your button quota.

674
00:57:11,568 --> 00:57:13,848
You're bound off,
make it a rest.

675
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,568
Keep your hands off me.

676
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:16,728
Henry, Henry

677
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:19,168
Listen, just go keep
Madeline company ok?

678
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:21,168
Sit down next to her.

679
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:24,848
I got you.

680
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:27,368
Sit down, sit down.

681
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:30,368
It's all my fault.
- Watch your head.

682
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:40,328
It's all my fault...

683
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:42,168
It's kinda a roller coaster, right?

684
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:45,168
I don’t like roller coasters either.

685
00:57:45,848 --> 00:57:47,368
It'll be okay.

686
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,248
I saw you pushed the button,
sweety...by the way...

687
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,168
It must runs in the family.

688
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:57,648
It'll be okay.
- Should I call 911?

689
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:00,568
Yeah, call 911.
- We gotta get outta here.

690
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,968
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

691
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,448
We're still waiting.

692
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,368
<i>Yes, sir, can you please explain...</i>

693
00:58:06,368 --> 00:58:08,888
Will you come help us?
<i>- What is your location?</i>

694
00:58:09,368 --> 00:58:10,768
Stuck in the fucking elevator.

695
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:16,048
<i>- Where are you?</i>
We need help, we need help now.

696
00:58:16,048 --> 00:58:20,168
<i>You must remain calm, sir.</i>
- Well I think I'm remaining calm actually.

697
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:24,368
We are fell off  in a fucking elevator
with a fucking bomb!

698
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,048
There are other people
and a goddamn corpse.

699
00:58:27,048 --> 00:58:29,368
My friend is bleeding out.
Now where are you?

700
00:58:30,248 --> 00:58:31,768
Hold this one on tight.

701
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:37,968
I'm not a prayer.
- You should be.

702
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:39,768
If you pray every day,
what good done to you?

703
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:43,168
If God knows everything, he knows I try to
do the right thing, I don’t have to kiss His ass

704
00:58:43,168 --> 00:58:46,048
Yep we need help,
we need help, now.

705
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:53,368
Could be worse.
- How?

706
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:57,248
Have you played the Colony, Celine?
- Are you retarded?

707
00:58:57,248 --> 00:59:02,168
Cos I ain't think this is a joke!
Look around, do you think this is funny?

708
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:05,048
There's a bomb in here that
might kill us any seconds...

709
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:07,568
And end my baby's life.

710
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:10,768
I don't know what you think its so
fucking funny, we're not your audience.

711
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:14,568
Hey, this is what I do. Some people cry,
some people can angry, I tell jokes.

712
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:17,568
I talk too much. And to be honest,
yes, I'm annoyed myself.

713
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:20,688
But does it make any
different to the bomb? No!

714
00:59:20,688 --> 00:59:23,688
I apologize for not the guy
you want me to get stuck with.

715
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:25,968
I don’t want this gig anyway,
I was a last minute substitution.

716
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,888
Do you know the story about of people
lost get on the plane that crashed?

717
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:33,328
I'm the guy that takes their place.

718
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:37,688
There...If the bomb goes off now,
I'm happy with those being my last words.

719
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:44,888
"'Porch, Porsche."

720
00:59:46,488 --> 00:59:48,288
I gotta remember that.

721
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,968
As Don says it does has whiskers.

722
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:01,768
No.

723
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:06,168
Guys, it's the bomb-maker.

724
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,288
What's the reason you
decided to come forward?

725
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:11,888
I thought Mrs. Redding was dead.

726
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:14,568
This is what she wanted.

727
01:00:14,568 --> 01:00:18,288
She wasn't a terrorist.
She was a good person.

728
01:00:19,768 --> 01:00:21,968
Maybe there's still time
to help these people.

729
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:26,568
Why did you do something like this?
Why did you make her a bomb?

730
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:31,168
I was friend with her son, Geoff in Iraq.

731
01:00:32,968 --> 01:00:37,048
We're like brothers, I owed them.
And his mother asked me for help.

732
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,768
Can you tell us more about the bomb?

733
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:44,168
It was much explosives...

734
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:48,648
And anybody in the elevator
would be surged.

735
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:52,368
You mean deadly?
- Yes, sir.

736
01:00:52,368 --> 01:00:55,648
<i>It would be damaged.</i>
<i>- How long do these people have?</i>

737
01:00:55,648 --> 01:00:57,648
<i>It's time to get out of there.</i>

738
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,768
<i>I guess it's within 10 minutes
more less...</i>

739
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:25,048
<i>- Maureen!</i>
Martha?

740
01:01:27,968 --> 01:01:30,368
Slow down, I'll just put you on speaker.

741
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:35,448
<i>They've evacuated the building
and the process is not complete.</i>

742
01:01:35,448 --> 01:01:38,568
<i>The bomb squad and the FBI
search the entire building.</i>

743
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:40,768
<i>And the cops are all over the world.</i>

744
01:01:40,768 --> 01:01:42,768
We have 10 minutes...

745
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,248
<i>Who's that?</i>

746
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:47,648
It's Celine. We just saw
interview with the bomb-maker.

747
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:50,048
He says we have 10 minutes.

748
01:01:50,048 --> 01:01:51,568
<i>They know that.</i>

749
01:01:51,568 --> 01:01:53,768
Do they hear the part
about 'more or less'?

750
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:56,568
<i>Who is that?</i>
- Who cares the fuck?

751
01:01:56,888 --> 01:01:59,568
I think that's gonna stands
their way the TV ratings.

752
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:02,688
<i>That's ridiculous!</i>
<i>It has to be bad.</i>

753
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:06,488
Really? 8 people stuck in
the box, waiting to die?

754
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,888
And what's that?

755
01:02:10,488 --> 01:02:12,768
We need to get outta here.

756
01:02:13,288 --> 01:02:17,768
<i>I'm sorry sweety, I know it must be awful,
but they're doing everything they can.</i>

757
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,168
<i>Hold on.</i>

758
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:23,968
Yeah, should go with the money,
cos money, money buys salvation.

759
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:29,128
Martha, I need you to help us.

760
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:32,048
<i>Keep streaming...</i>

761
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:36,128
She asked us how much
battery we have left.

762
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:43,928
Looks like we must do
everything what we can.

763
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,408
We have to be.

764
01:03:06,128 --> 01:03:09,728
Alright, I know things don't look great
right now, but there's a bit of good luck.

765
01:03:09,728 --> 01:03:11,688
- Please George...
I was thinking the elevator dropped, right?

766
01:03:11,728 --> 01:03:15,408
So elevator dropped, how do we know
 the doors have been line-up now?

767
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:19,128
We go look out.
- Ok, I take this side.

768
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:19,848
Let's do it.

769
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:22,728
If we can get out, we'll
push Madeline out first.

770
01:03:22,728 --> 01:03:24,208
Get ready, Madeline.

771
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,608
It's all my fault.
- She's ready.

772
01:03:28,408 --> 01:03:31,048
We have to do it the same time.
- Get ready.  - Now.

773
01:03:33,888 --> 01:03:35,808
Mohammed...

774
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:40,008
I can't get any traction cos
of my leg, a bit sting here.

775
01:03:43,008 --> 01:03:44,608
There isn't coming, is it?

776
01:03:47,568 --> 01:03:49,488
Shit..

777
01:03:49,528 --> 01:03:51,328
We did get it open before.

778
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,688
We had Don...

779
01:03:53,688 --> 01:03:56,928
And we're dealing with Muhammed's
restless leg syndrome.

780
01:03:57,168 --> 01:04:00,688
And how the fuck do you think
I got this? well you fucking moron !

781
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,088
I barely touched you...
- Henry...

782
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:05,888
We need your help.
Come on.

783
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:09,368
Henry, you're gonna do this
for Madeline, alright? ok.

784
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:13,208
Needs to pull really hard that way.
Here we go...

785
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:16,408
And...Pull!

786
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:19,728
Pull harder.

787
01:04:21,088 --> 01:04:23,408
Come on.

788
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,488
Shit.

789
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:48,328
We still have a few minutes.
- More less...

790
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:51,168
So that's it.

791
01:04:54,288 --> 01:05:00,048
This is...this is wanna where
we all...died.

792
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:06,088
It happens.
This is where it's gonna happen for us.

793
01:05:08,688 --> 01:05:12,568
It's all because...this...

794
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:16,008
This fucking pathetic...

795
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:20,168
woman who can't take
responsibility for her actions.

796
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,888
And because of you.

797
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:27,808
You don’t...you don’t give a fuck, do you?

798
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:31,088
You knew those bonds were crap.

799
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:33,088
Everybody did.

800
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:36,808
Don memo-ed to me 8 months ago.
We all knew.

801
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:42,408
But you, you forced us
to push among these people.

802
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:45,488
Barton, you hear me in there?

803
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:47,888
We need to open the
doors 1 more time.

804
01:05:47,888 --> 01:05:49,688
Well, it's a brick wall,
we can't get out.

805
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,808
I just need to see something first.
- Get it yourself.

806
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:55,728
It may not be a big deal, but I just
need to open the doors 1 more time, ok? ok?

807
01:05:57,488 --> 01:06:01,208
Ok, everybody everybody, come on, 1 more time.
Henry, I need you.

808
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,208
Again?
- Yes, 1 more time, come on! Pull !

809
01:06:15,608 --> 01:06:17,408
I need something sharp.

810
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:23,488
Who's got anything sharp?
Something sharp.

811
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:32,208
This? This is it?
- That's all I've got.

812
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,168
No one has anything else?

813
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:35,688
What do you expect George?
We're going to a cocktail party.

814
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:39,088
George, what are you thinking?
- It was Don's idea, really.

815
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:41,008
But there's room enough to drop
the bomb down the elevator.

816
01:06:41,008 --> 01:06:43,328
How?
- You can cut through metal cable with that.

817
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:46,008
I know.
- Well then, how?

818
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:50,008
You can't be serious.
- I told you it was a last resort.

819
01:06:50,008 --> 01:06:52,208
Can do what?
- She's not gonna get any dead-er.

820
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,328
It's all I got.

821
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:56,928
We have to cut the body in half.

822
01:06:58,088 --> 01:06:59,848
How much time do we have?

823
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,608
How much time do we have?
- It's about 3 minutes.

824
01:07:01,608 --> 01:07:05,488
They are on their way, they're
gonna be here any seconds.

825
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,208
Hold on, hold on, we can't count on that.
Ok listen, George is right.

826
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:11,488
It's not like she's gonna another different.
- Is that against the law?

827
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:14,008
Fuck the law!
This is our lives we're talking about, ok?

828
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:17,608
She got us in this situation in the first place.
- She's still a human being...ok?

829
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:20,208
She was a human being,
now she's a corpse.

830
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,688
Who's gonna do it?

831
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:27,608
I've done my fair share
volunteering, George.

832
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,488
This is your idea.
I'm not touching this.

833
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:32,288
I'll help.

834
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:35,808
I can't do it,
but I'll roll back whoever push.

835
01:07:36,408 --> 01:07:40,288
Ok, okay, I'll do it.
I mean how, how much worse can it get.

836
01:07:41,688 --> 01:07:45,888
Look we just clear the bomb off of her,
drop down the shaft and then we're good.

837
01:07:45,888 --> 01:07:46,848
We're good.

838
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:49,008
Ok, well, I'll do it.

839
01:07:49,008 --> 01:07:51,528
I'll do it, but we're
all doing it together.

840
01:07:51,528 --> 01:07:54,968
We're all in this together, its like
we're all holding a knife...ok?

841
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:58,088
Okay?

842
01:07:58,088 --> 01:08:00,008
Mohammed?

843
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:02,488
Alright, alright.

844
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:19,648
Ok...

845
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:25,848
Do I start the front or cut
through the back bone or what?

846
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:30,128
Under the ribs.

847
01:08:31,688 --> 01:08:34,288
Shit Muhammed, you're the medic.
- I don't know.

848
01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:38,888
Stomach is softer.
- Just, just do something, just start.

849
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:42,408
I bet she should not to be held down right?
- I don't think so.

850
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:44,328
Ok, so...

851
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,408
So, just anywhere, right?

852
01:08:46,408 --> 01:08:49,288
- Oh fuck, come on, for fuck's sake
we're running out of time George.

853
01:08:50,808 --> 01:08:53,408
If we get out of here alive,
would you have sex with me?

854
01:08:53,408 --> 01:08:54,048
No.

855
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:56,688
Ok, I like that answer, because
it means you have hope.

856
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:59,488
If you'd said yes, that's mean
you've thought there is no hope.

857
01:08:59,488 --> 01:09:01,208
Cut her!

858
01:09:01,968 --> 01:09:03,888
Ok, Ok.

859
01:09:03,888 --> 01:09:05,408
Here it goes.

860
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,688
I can't do it.

861
01:09:08,688 --> 01:09:11,288
Come on, George.
- I can't, I'm sorry.

862
01:09:11,328 --> 01:09:13,808
George, you promised, you promised
you would, come on George. - Can't, sorry.

863
01:09:13,808 --> 01:09:16,408
George, you have to do it.
- No, I don't have to do shit.

864
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:18,208
George, come on.

865
01:09:20,608 --> 01:09:23,128
I'll do it.

866
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:30,488
I'll cut the bitch.

867
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:32,408
Get there, boy.

868
01:09:32,408 --> 01:09:35,088
Where's the knife?
- Here we go.

869
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:46,528
When I was in high school...

870
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:51,008
I've spent the summers
working in a butcher shop.

871
01:09:54,728 --> 01:09:57,968
Whose knife is this?

872
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,728
Come on.

873
01:10:02,008 --> 01:10:05,328
What did you do with it?
Car...brakes?

874
01:10:05,608 --> 01:10:08,208
I use it to clean my nails.

875
01:10:08,608 --> 01:10:10,528
Come on.

876
01:10:11,328 --> 01:10:14,008
She is tough!

877
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:18,128
How much time do we have?
- Less than one.

878
01:10:20,728 --> 01:10:23,208
Somebody get the guts,
I can't see what I'm doing.

879
01:10:25,128 --> 01:10:26,568
Huh me?

880
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:28,688
Ok, I'll do it.

881
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,768
I'll fucking do it.

882
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:40,128
No merit badge just for this.

883
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:43,328
I'm gonna be sick.

884
01:10:44,928 --> 01:10:47,728
Now we're fortunate she didn't eat first.

885
01:10:51,408 --> 01:10:54,528
I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh, God.

886
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:57,848
There is always a bright side.

887
01:10:58,608 --> 01:11:03,328
I can't get to this
spine with this thing.

888
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:05,808
Be quicker if we break it.

889
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:09,528
How? How we're gonna do that?

890
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:11,808
Someone takes one hand and
someone takes the other...

891
01:11:11,808 --> 01:11:13,408
We'll just twist it.

892
01:11:13,408 --> 01:11:14,168
How?

893
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:17,208
We've come this far,
we are gonna finish.

894
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:21,608
If we get out of here, I want you
to give each of us a million dollars.

895
01:11:21,608 --> 01:11:24,408
This is bullshit.
And a million for her baby too.

896
01:11:24,408 --> 01:11:25,928
It's the least you can do.

897
01:11:28,528 --> 01:11:31,128
Alright,
If we get out.

898
01:11:32,328 --> 01:11:35,128
Deal?
- Deal.

899
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:39,528
Here, you take this end
The rest of you, take her feet.

900
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:43,128
We've come this far.
- On a count to three.

901
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:45,528
Go twist to the left,
you twist to the right.

902
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,408
One, two, three...

903
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:57,328
You both have to go to the right.

904
01:11:57,328 --> 01:12:00,608
Alright, ready?
- One, two, three.

905
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:04,408
Ow, she's getting stiff!

906
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:24,088
<i>One, two, three.</i>

907
01:12:34,328 --> 01:12:36,608
<i>This is Lieutenant Carson
with the bomb squad.</i>

908
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:39,088
<i>We are gonna get you out of there.</i>

909
01:12:39,728 --> 01:12:41,208
We outta time!

910
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,408
<i>We have men in shaft that trying
to unlock the brake,</i>

911
01:12:43,408 --> 01:12:45,608
<i>We want to lower you to the
next floor.</i>

912
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:47,128
Make it quick!

913
01:12:51,528 --> 01:12:53,128
That's gotta be a good sign.

914
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:59,248
Mohammed...

915
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,008
Ok, He's barely alive.
We gotta get him out of here, come on!

916
01:13:10,608 --> 01:13:12,808
Get us out of here.

917
01:13:12,808 --> 01:13:15,328
