There's no thing that killed my father.

He fell down the stairs.

Oh, but it wasn't the fall
that killed him.

I mean, your mama went downstairs after
you called her, just like you said.

And she found that he had fallen
on this thing in this freak way.

It was even in the newspapers.

That's how Jack died.

He fell with tragic,
almost inconceivable precision

01:27:15,732 --> 01:27:19,026
on this thing,
and it crushed his sternum.

Just as surely as if someone
had smashed it into his body.

You were tearing boards
off that shed.

How could you remember that?

You were 7 years old.
You were scared to death.

1302

I remember that you were holding
that thing when you hugged me.

1303
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:39,297
When you dropped it,
it made this loud clanging sound.

You're trying to tear my family apart.

Just because you lost
your own parents.

affairs and don't kill their husbands

having the affair.

Robin Hayes was a horse wrangler.

Your father was leaving,
that's why she killed him.

And what's worse, she made you,
her own child, think that he did it,

so she could bind you to her
