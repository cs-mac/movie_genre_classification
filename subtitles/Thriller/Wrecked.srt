00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,728
Losing my fucking mind.

Are we friends, George?

13
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,839
What the hell are we doing here?

16
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,550
Shit!

Wait, wait, wait. Calm down,
I'll get you out of here.

28
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,975
Calm down.
Get this open, please.

29
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,139
Water, water.

30
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,481
Water.

31
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,125
Water.

32
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,099
Are you hungry?

33
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,261
Do you want this?

34
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:22,892
It's ok.

35
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:33,435
Hey, it's ok.

36
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,240
Everything's gonna be alright now.

37
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:40,743
I promise.

38
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:10,899
What the fuck?

39
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,978
Get away from him!

40
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,883
You hear me?
Get away from him!

41
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:36,091
Get out of there!

42
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,923
Get out of there! I'm warning you!
You stop that! You st..,.

43
00:25:57,448 --> 00:25:59,448
That's right.

44
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,955
I told him.

45
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:11,994
I warned him.

46
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,332
What the fuck is this?

47
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,211

You.

64
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,435
Raymond.

65
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,977

My name is Raymond.

67
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,704
<i>Police have identified three men</i>

00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:23,170
You're a good dog?

95
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,315
You're a bad dog?

96
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:28,977
I hate mint!

97
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,959
I had a dog when I was a kid.

98
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:57,132
He had a name.

99
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,477
Duke.

100
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:46,107

00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:28,810
Get it!

128
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,411
Chicken!

129
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,199
You chicken!

130
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,778

137
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:53,799
I don't care!

138
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:21,195
What?

139
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:22,930
What?

140
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,999
What do you want?

141
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,967
Go!
What is it?

142
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,518
No! What?

143
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:35,428
What?

144
01:04:44,205 --> 01:04:45,605
No!

145
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,817
No!

146
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,431

No, no.

149
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:15,286
Fuck you.

150
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,127
Move the fuck away from me!

151
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:22,903
Move the fuck away!

152
01:06:23,704 --> 01:06:25,868
I know what you're trying to do.

153
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:29,509
I don't want you here!

154
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,010
I don't want you here!

155
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:32,980
I don't want you here!

156
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,981
I know.

157
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:41,721
You did this!

158
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,858
You didn't think I would do it?

159
01:06:46,928 --> 01:06:48,228
Well I did.

160
01:06:48,729 --> 01:06:50,859
I did.

161
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:52,499
No.

162
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,945
There's no road.

163
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,620
Stupid.

164
01:11:38,536 --> 01:11:40,536
Yeah, I told you it was a stupid idea.

165
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:44,605
Fucking stupid.

166
01:11:47,706 --> 01:11:49,906
Keep talking, yeah.

167
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,910
Keep talking.

168
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:05,158
Shut the fuck up!

169
01:12:09,598 --> 01:12:11,798
That's what I thought.

170
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:29,638
Cause we've had this conversation already.
- Why? Yeah, I know we've had.

171
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,040
We've had that conversation like...
- Oh, god! Well you just get...

172
01:19:32,049 --> 01:19:34,640
What do you want?
You gotta do things like that, I mean...

173
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:45,718
Absolutely not.

174
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,283
Let's go!
- Out of the fucking way!

175
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,417
Let's go, guys!

176
01:20:16,418 --> 01:20:18,518
Gotta go! Come on! Let's go!
- What? What are you doing?

177
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,789
No!
- Oh, my god!

178
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:23,089
Shit! What the fuck is this?

179
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,093
Who the fuck is this?

180
01:20:25,128 --> 01:20:28,126
Come on, go!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

181
01:20:28,527 --> 01:20:28,995
Go!

182
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:31,064
Oh, my god! Simon!

183
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:33,333
Left here! Go left!
I got it, I got it!

184
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:34,367
This wasn't fucking planned!

185
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:35,504
You shot the fucking guy!

186
01:20:35,505 --> 01:20:36,905
Calm down, guys!

187
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:49,801
The dog.
- What?

188
01:22:51,105 --> 01:22:52,805
My dog.

189
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:04,450
There's no dog.

190
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:29,909
You ok?
