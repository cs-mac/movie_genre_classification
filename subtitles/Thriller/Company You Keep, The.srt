1
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:40,114
A Federal Grand Jury in Detroit today charged the
thirteen top leaders of 'the Weathermen'

2
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:43,625
with plotting to bomb public buildings
in Chicago, Detroit, New York,

3
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:45,243
and Berkeley, California.

4
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:49,142
'The Weathermen' are the militant faction of
the Students for a Democratic Society,

5
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,046
only one of the thirteen is now in custody.

6
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,534
Never before has this nation fought a war which

7
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:01,078
so many Americans opposed
for so many different reasons.

8
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,342
Never has this dissent been
as emotional, as intense,

9
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,073
as is the dissent against
the war in Vietnam.

10
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,688
The bomb went off in the State Department
and did a lot of damage

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,781
another was detonated in Oakland.

12
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:28,897
Three suspects remain at large
after a security guard was shot and killed

13
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:30,782
during a robbery at
the Bank of Michigan.

14
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:32,449
The FBI has released the names

15
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,742
Mimi Lurie, Nicholas Sloan,
and Sharon Solarz;

16
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:40,347
all members of the radical anti-war group,
'The Weather Underground'.

17
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,547
Come on you guys, let's go.

18
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,549
- Bye Mom.
- Don't forget I have practice after school.

19
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,681
What are you still practicing for?
You already got into college.

20
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,059
- ...take out.
- Thank you sir, have a good one!

21
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,499
- Hey!
- Hey.

22
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:18,726
- That's $25.74, do you want that warmed up?
- No, Thanks

23
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:35,956
- Don't move! Hands in the air!
- Don't move, Federal agents!

24
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,544
Get on the car!
Hands behind your back!

25
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:43,933
Sharon Solarz, you are under arrest for
the murder of Hugh Kroessna,

26
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,128
You have the right to remain silent,
if you give up that right, anything you say

27
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,248
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

28
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:50,844
You have the right to an attorney,

29
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,756
if you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

30
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,574
Do you understand these rights?

31
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,056
Sharon Elizabeth Solarz,
one of the longest-standing fugitives

32
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:00,857
on the FBI's most wanted list

33
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,150
was arrested yesterday, just
outside Heatherton, New York.

34
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,929
30 years after the notorious Bank of Michigan robbery

35
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,331
that claimed the life of a guard.
- Good morning, Jess.

36
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:10,942
You're late.

37
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,875
Well, if I'm not here
they can't fire me, right?

38
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,330
You look beautiful!
- Thanks

39
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,744
Oh... look at that.

40
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,655
National story, right in our own
backyard, and where were we?

41
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,047
Hold on. Crime was Yukanowitz's, you fired him.
- Yeah, and I passed it on to you.

42
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,145
Along with the courts and the State house
and like 55 other things, I mean...

43
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:33,716
This... is news, Ben.

44
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:35,157
This!

45
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:40,469
We're a goddamn newspaper!
Remember?

46
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:45,753
So why don't you go out and write a nice little story
that informs our readers, while we still have a few?

47
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,361
I'm sorry, okay?

48
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,297
It's that bad, huh?

49
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,299
Do you still have your friend in the FBI field office?

50
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:00,086
In theory, although I'm not sure she
ever wants to speak to me again.

51
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:04,284
Y' keep telling me you're a good reporter, right?
- Right.

52
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,876
Prove it.

53
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,651
These were major radicals, Ben,
who know how to hide.

54
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:16,381
So how does the FBI
find her after 30 years? Hmm?

55
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:25,968
So, let me s... the State wants to sieze
private property in transfer, right?

56
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,300
Y... Yes, I know what 'imminent domain' is.

57
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,148
I will if I have to.

58
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,997
Court of Appeals exist for a reason.

59
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,491
Izzy!
- Yeah.

60
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:36,931
- You'd better be getting ready.

61
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,756
Aha...

62
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:43,087
And you're saying that satisfies public use?

63
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:45,918
Really?

64
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:47,551
Izzy! You ready?

65
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,512
Yeah.

66
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,174
Come on, we're gonna be late.

67
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,659
We're not gonna be late.
- You wanna bet?

68
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:03,787
My client bought it from his dad,
who bought it from his dad,

69
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:06,484
and hopes one day to
sell it to his son.

70
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,201
It's a great family, I'm sure
the jury would enjoy meeting them.

71
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,405
Okay.

72
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,460
Right on time!

73
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,093
- All set?
- Yup.

74
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,270
You got your lunch?

75
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,439
No...

76
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:39,741
So, what's last, math?
- No, I've got volleyball practice...

77
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:42,491
Oh, okay. I'll pick you up after practice.
- Okay.

78
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,284
Hey, what's your hurry?
Haven't you forgotten something?

79
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,439
- Billy.

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,977
- Hi, Mr. Cusinamo.
- Hi, sweetie!

81
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:03,168
Are your kids a little old for this school?
- I came to see you... you seen the news?

82
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:06,763
Oh, they're still reporting the news!
- Sharon Solarz

83
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,365
Go ahead, go ahead.

84
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,972
You know who she is, right?
- What?

85
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,676
She was busted, man. She was
arrested over in Heatherton.

86
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:16,281
Why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause Sharon's an old friend.

87
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:19,566
- Are you in trouble, Billy, y' know, or are you still on parole?
- I'm clean, man.

88
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,331
What's going on?

89
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,510
She called me, wanting to turn herself in to
the Feds. They're assholes, they don't care!

90
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:29,191
- But you can't get involved in someth...
- She's a friend, she needs a lawyer.

91
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,668
- Well, I can't give advice...
- They knew exactly where she was gonna be, Jim, alright?

92
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:32,821
Exactly. They knew.

93
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,934
- They knew exactly.
- Well, this is outa my league.

94
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:35,894
Out of my league.

95
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,188
I can't let her twist in the wind.
- I can't do it.

96
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,895
I have a kid that just lost her mom.

97
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,392
It's been a year...

98
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,121
Sorry.

99
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,194
Call Maggie Hart,

100
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:54,781
Lockwood and Dunlop, Philly.

101
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,650
Okay? She's great.
Better'n me.

102
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,998
Sorry.

103
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:09,486
Please set it here.

104
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,012
Go ahead.

105
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,857
So... you moved her this morning?

106
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,890
Why do you care? I thought
you were covering politics now.

107
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,686
Well, I'm multi-talented.

108
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:23,579
How come she was arrested here if she's been
a Vermont housewife for thirty years?

109
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:24,930
You'll have to ask her that.

110
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,274
You know, it's funny you should mention it, Dee

111
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:28,867
'cause from what I hear people give
jailhouse interviews all the time.

112
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:31,608
Who do you think you are,
The New York Times?

113
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,967
You say New York Times like it's 1985
and you're still impressed.

114
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,404
You're just a local beat reporter.
- I love it when you do that with your hair.

115
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,284
This is a national news story,
I think you should go home and tweet about it.

116
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,784
I don't tweet.
- Right! You don't email either.

117
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:49,381
Can I just see the case file?
For old times' sake? Please?

118
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:53,193
Just because we hooked up in college
I'm gonna give you access to FBI wiretaps?

119
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:57,481
Wiretaps? What wiretaps?
- This is why I don't talk to you.

120
00:08:57,674 --> 00:09:00,854
And we didn't just "hook up" in college, okay, we were...
- I have to go.

121
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,594
New sheriff in town?
- How can you tell?

122
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,245
Well, that's how it usually goes, right?

123
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,089
Big case like this, they usually
bring in someone from out of town?

124
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:08,685
Grab all the glory?

125
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:10,891
Course, the local field office should
at least get credit in the local paper.

126
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,796
Why don't I go put in a good word for you!
I'm a very social guy...

127
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,803
Billy Cusimano.
- Organic grocery guy?

128
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,188
It didn't come from me.
- No, just a well-placed, extremely attractive government source.

129
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:25,285
Cusimano

130
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,957
Hey Dad! Here?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,607
Hello!

132
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,494
Billy Cusimano?

133
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:50,597
My name's Ben Shepard,
from the Albany Sun-Times,

134
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:53,124
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about the Sharon Solarz arrest?

135
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,094
You can, but why would I comment about that?
- Well, you know her, don't you?

136
00:09:58,671 --> 00:09:59,908
No, I don't.

137
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:05,892
Quick search of police records shows you
and Sharon together in Mendocino in 1971.

138
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,223
I've never been to Mendocino.

139
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:11,299
That's not true, is it? You were dealing hash there
for an outfit called the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

140
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,709
Which is a great name, by the way.

141
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:15,812
Sharon been in touch recently?

142
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:19,700
Look, I know she called
you prior to her arrest.

143
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,096
You talked to Jim Grant.
- No, I talked to the FBI, who's Jim Grant?

144
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,964
Who is the FBI?
- Well, they had you on a wiretap here for a while,

145
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:28,792
so it seems you're growin' somethin' more
than tomatoes and potatoes here, Billy.

146
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,888
Shit. That's why I pay taxes, right?
So Big Brother can... hack my fuckin' phone!

147
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,291
Who's Jim Grant?
- He's a lawyer, man.

148
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,562
Lawyer? Sharon's?
- Nah, he wouldn't take the case.

149
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:40,523
Look, kid...

150
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,403
Sharon called me wanting to turn herself in...
- Turn herself in?

151
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,793
Nope, I'm not saying anything else.
Everything here is off the record.

152
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,103
Ah, see... it doesn't work that way. You gotta say
"off the record" before we have the conversation.

153
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,295
Who says?
- Those are the rules.

154
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,511
There's rules for what you people do, huh?

155
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:20,006
So, what did she say?
- She said that I did great

156
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:22,221
and that she was very impressed.

157
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,343
What'd I tell you?

158
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:34,059
Yeah?
- Hi... uh, is this Mr. Grant?

159
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:37,862
This is Ben Shepherd from the Albany Sun-Times?
- Oh... yes.

160
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,147
<i>Just wondering if you care to comment
on the Sharon Solarz arrest?</i>

161
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,919
- What?
- The Sharon Solarz arrest, you declined to take her case...

162
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah, you know... I'm just sitting down to dinner right now.
I gotta call you back, okay?

163
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:49,448
Uh, sir... I ju...

164
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,888
As the turbulent decade drew to a close

165
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,387
the Students for a Democratic Society,

166
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:04,916
the leading student group
opposed to the war in Vietnam,

167
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:10,313
had its power usurped by a more militant faction,
known as the Weather Underground Organization.

168
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,996
Frustrated with years
of non-violent protests

169
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,898
that had failed to end the war,

170
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:19,178
the so-called "Weathermen" decided the best
way to stop America's involvement in Vietnam

171
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,197
was to bring the war home.

172
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:23,922
The Weathermen radicalized the anti-war movement,

173
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,476
and carried out a series of bombings
against government institutions including

174
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:31,102
bombing the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol,
and the State Department.

175
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:35,227
No group has been more successful
in carrying out attacks on U.S. soil.

176
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,908
What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

177
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,021
You look weird.
- I'm fine, honey.

178
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:54,112
You're lying.
- I'm not lying...

179
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,204
You are lying, because you're smiling.

180
00:12:57,205 --> 00:13:01,102
I'm not smiling.
- "I'm not smiling."

181
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:05,974
Well maybe I'm happy?
Here. Come on, eat.

182
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,510
And then get ready.

183
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,415
Hey!
- Hey.

184
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,011
- You Jim Grant, by chance?
- Not by chance.

185
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:23,447
Would you follow up on those
counter-signatures from Roger?

186
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,504
Yep.

187
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,107
I'm Ben Shepherd, Albany Sun-Times, we spoke on the phone.
I just figured I'd come by and say hi...

188
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:31,827
I don't really have anything to say...
Oh, and Susan, would you pull out the Rochester files for...?

189
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,808
You don't know what I'm gonna ask you yet.
- ..the report for my deposition? Do what?

190
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,832
I said you don't know what I'm gonna ask you yet.

191
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,113
Well, you're a reporter.

192
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,417
Well, I could just put "Refused
to answer any questions."

193
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,230
What?
- I'm just doing a little background, sir.

194
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:53,578
Okay.
- Thank you! (Thank you.)

195
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,419
No, no... we're off the record here.

196
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,806
Which part?
- All of it...

197
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:10,610
whatever it is we're gonna be talking about here,
otherwise, you can leave now.

198
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,520
No, that's fine.
It's not important.

199
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,319
So, did Sharon Solarz contact you
prior to her arrest?

200
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:23,105
Does it matter?
Since you already printed that she did?

201
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:26,904
Actually, what was printed was that she may have approached
a public-interest lawyer who declined to take the case.

202
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,549
But your name was never mentioned.

203
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,729
There are 25 lawyers in the area.

204
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:38,617
Nine do criminal,
six do accidents,

205
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:41,317
five do deeds, and four do closings...
and then there's me.

206
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,530
I wasn't insinuating...
- The hell with accuracy, huh?

207
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:47,626
Be vague, be accusatory, and whatever sticks? Is that how it works?
- Nothing I wrote was false.

208
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:50,174
You made it seem like I was
harboring a known fugitive.

209
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:55,919
We can issue a correction.
- Sharon Solarz... did not contact me,

210
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:58,510
and I have no involvement in her case.

211
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,046
Really?
- Really.

212
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:04,012
Do you know she's now being represented
by a Margaret Hart in Philadelphia?

213
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:07,447
Right.
- Ms. Hart was a classmate of yours in law school?

214
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,407
Mm-hmm.

215
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,308
Lawyers know each other,
that's news?

216
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,835
Yeah, but you did refer Ms. Hart
as counsel, didn't you?

217
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,845
Says who?
- Ms. Hart herself, this morning.

218
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:19,029
Maggie Hart is one of the best
defense lawyers in the country.

219
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,816
But why pass this off? I mean,
that's what doesn't make sense to me.

220
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,316
Cases like this don't come around very often,
I'm sure I don't have to tell you that.

221
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:27,121
'Cause Sharon Solarz deserves a
better defense than I can provide.

222
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,513
Deserves? That's
an interesting word choice.

223
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,625
You know, it may seem untrue to you,
but we do live in a free country

224
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,021
and people are entitled to
a decent defense.

225
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:37,922
Now look, I got work to do.

226
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,222
You've handled First Amendment cases,

227
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,116
labor cases, you worked
hand-in-glove with the ACLU...

228
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,914
I mean, this is right in
your wheelhouse, isn't it?

229
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:47,051
Is this what you came here to talk about?
- I'm not sure yet.

230
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,823
Well, that pretty well sums up why journalism
is dead. Now, do you mind?

231
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,912
Why did Billy Cusimano come to you?
- I don't know.

232
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,543
Well, how well do you
know Billy Cusimano?

233
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:57,406
- I don't, really.

234
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,915
I mean... you do, really.
You represented him a few years back,

235
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,024
on a drug case, you got him off.
- I represent a lot of people, Jesus...

236
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,896
Mist... Look, I'm not trying to offend you, Mr. Grant, I'm...

237
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:09,988
Oh, I'm not offended. You're
pretty much exactly what I expected.

238
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,921
Susan, I'll call you from the car.

239
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,378
Sir...

240
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,842
Mr. Grant... look, I'm just trying to put the pieces together.
- Hey. Look, look... Listen...

241
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:23,202
I didn't take the case because I'm a
single parent with a private practice

242
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,809
and too much on my plate, alright?

243
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:26,425
If I could have helped, I would've.

244
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,814
Because you are sympathetic to their cause?
You agree with her tactics?

245
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,284
You know, clearly you have
some kind of an agenda here,

246
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,986
I don't have time for this bullshit.
- I don't, actually...

247
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,239
I don't care much for either side.

248
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,914
So, what? That makes you fair and balanced?

249
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:44,447
You know... it's a funny thing. Thirty years ago, a smart guy
like you probably would've been involved with the movement yourself.

250
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,709
I hope you get what you're
looking for, kid. Take care.

251
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,155
Thank you

252
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:43,297
Hold one sec'... hang on.

253
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:46,806
Thank you for doing this.
- No worries, mate. I got you.

254
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:47,958
Thank you.

255
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,415
Hey, guys!

256
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,159
Sorry I'm late.
- Not a problem, we're having fun.

257
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,531
You do your homework?
- Of course.

258
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,927
Ah, good...
Thank you.

259
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,314
I'm the one who did it.

260
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,756
- Oh, ooh... well, thank you.

261
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,741
She's getting better every day.
- Yeah...

262
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:07,843
Hey.

263
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,764
I'm sorry, can you walk me through that research, please?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,821
Thank you.

265
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,620
It's... uh, all basic stuff,

266
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:21,568
He was, uh, born in Bakersfield, California...
attended Iowa State University,

267
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:26,140
University of Virginia Law...
uh, met his wife while working at the... Planet... Earth...

268
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,808
Earth First Foundation?
- Yeah...

269
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,042
and came up here,
started his own practice.

270
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,934
This his wife?
What happened to her?

271
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,218
Car accident. 48-years-old.

272
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:37,561
Wow... that's horrible.

273
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:41,733
Yeah, you meet a younger woman, you have a kid...
she's not supposed to die on ya'...

274
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:45,530
supposed to meet a car salesman
and move to Vegas, like mine did.

275
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:48,434
Anything else?
- Umm... house is paid for,

276
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:50,330
he's obviously a responsible single parent...

277
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,935
pillar of society, do-gooder...
lot of pro bono work...

278
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:56,440
Right. So basically, nothing I can
turn into a story. Great.

279
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:31,577
Hello, Dan?

280
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:34,315
I can not believe you're calling me!

281
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:36,822
I know.
- This is a goddamn nightmare...

282
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:39,427
Dan...
- I don't want anything to do with this.

283
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,128
Dan, you're my brother.
I need your help.

284
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:48,228
Go ahead.

285
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:13,647
Ray, who's your best reporter?

286
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,423
Mansfield.
- Mansfield?

287
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,846
Bullshit.

288
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,030
Please, have a seat.
- Look...

289
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,942
So, at first I think Grant is trying to
link up with the others,

290
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,634
help negotiate a deal, bring them in,
like Solarz tried.

291
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:29,338
Yeah, well... that would make a good story.
- It gets so much better...

292
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:31,352
So I go and I look at the man's history,

293
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:34,038
right, see if he has any known
associations to the Weathermen.

294
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,029
Nothing.
- So?

295
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,652
Nothing on the man at all...
the man doesn't exist before 1979.

296
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:41,540
Look at this...

297
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:46,248
I had it wrong, Ray.
He's dead.

298
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,261
Jim Grant is not trying to represent
Mimi Lurie or Nick Sloan.

299
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,222
Jim Grant is Nick Sloan.

300
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,146
I'm tired.
- I know, sweetheart, but we have to get an early start.

301
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,743
For school?
- No, we're not going to school.

302
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,022
Then where are we going?
- Well, we're gonna go on a little trip.

303
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,344
A trip?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,434
Breaking news this morning
from the Albany Sun-Times

305
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:23,039
reporting former seventies radical fugitive
Nicholas Sloan has been discovered in Albany,

306
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,639
living as a lawyer
named James Grant.

307
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:29,991
Sloan is wanted for murder, and has been
on the run for more than thirty years.

308
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:33,925
Alright people, what do we have on Grant?

309
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:37,425
His EasyPass paid a toll at 4 this morning
on I-87, heading north,

310
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:39,137
ah, the border's already been alerted.

311
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,446
We have an agent talking to his secretary.
- Why don't we have a better picture of Grant?

312
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,225
We're working on it.
- Well, what about from his house?

313
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,646
Just waiting on the warrant.

314
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,882
Their bodies are so bendy.

315
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:59,208
Do you know this one's name?

316
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:04,451
Border security cams are still being
checked, there's no matches yet.

317
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:07,740
Does Grant have any family?
- A daughter, 11.

318
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:10,427
Is she with him? Call the school.
- She didn't show.

319
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:12,447
Both parents deceased,
brother in New York.

320
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,892
Alright, put a tail on the brother,

321
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:17,649
I want bank accounts, credit cards,
tracked not frozen.

322
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,456
Where are we on the Title three?

323
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,236
I wanna bug every place
this guy is known to go, I mean...

324
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:25,628
somebody, somewhere knows something,
and someone's going to talk.

325
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,553
Now, come on people, this guy's been
making us look bad for thirty years now.

326
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:30,086
Let's not be stupid.

327
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,796
Welcome to the Rosewood.

328
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,349
May I take those, sir?
- No thanks, we're fine.

329
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,982
Right this way...

330
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:51,731
Just one moment...

331
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,639
There you go!
- Thank you.

332
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:03,532
Enjoy your stay, Mister Graves.
- Thank you.

333
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:41,956
What's that?

334
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:51,137
What happened?
- It's behind the napkin.

335
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,336
What?
- "What?"

336
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,536
Evil eyes.

337
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,480
So, tell me something... what, uh...

338
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:01,567
What was the best thing that happened to you today?

339
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,455
Um... well... I got a pet seal,

340
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:08,674
well, not pet seal,
but a little seal doll.

341
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,381
And does it... did you give it a name?

342
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:13,518
I named her Harper.

343
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,871
Harper? Why Harper?
- Yeah... 'Cause it's a harbor seal...

344
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,437
Har-bor.
- Yeah. So it's Harper. Harbor. Harper. Harbor.

345
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:26,779
Oh, I get the connection.
So, right... well where is it? Where's Harper?

346
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,999
Hmmm... not there.

347
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:36,487
Somethin' you should love you
should keep close to, you know?

348
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:41,852
We're disappointed in you.
- Hah! You're disappointed in me!

349
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:06,642
Daniel Sloan is on the move,
we're tracking him.

350
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:39,544
See you soon.

351
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,146
Daniel Sloan has stopped at
the Rosewood Hotel.

352
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,447
We're keeping a safe distance.

353
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,767
You two canvas the stairs.

354
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:02,919
You take the elevators.

355
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,153
Hey, what's that noise?

356
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,684
It's a goddamn fire alarm.

357
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay, lock down the building now,
no one goes in or out.

358
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:16,809
Not if there's a fire.

359
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,354
Daddy? Dad!

360
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:27,454
Come on!

361
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:35,586
Okay, what the hell is happening?
- They're evacuating the building.

362
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:38,690
Shit!  It's a diversion!

363
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,185
Contact the local police and fire department,

364
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,674
notify them that we have a dangerous fugitive,

365
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:45,674
send them a description of Nicholas Sloan.

366
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,591
Alright, what do we have on the brother, and where is he?
- I have no idea...

367
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:52,223
and the place is completely jammed,
and there's too many people... I can't...

368
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,784
I got him!
East stairwell!

369
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,672
Don't move!
Stay right there!

370
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:59,360
Monroe's got him! Don't move!
- I'm her uncle! The girl is my niece.

371
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:02,676
I'm her guardian, I have papers.
- Let me see!

372
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:07,856
Don't be scared,
it's okay, honey.

373
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:13,081
He's got custody papers,
it's Sloan's daughter.

374
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:16,581
Jesus Christ.
- Alright, he handed her off, he can't be far.

375
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:18,756
Send the second team down to the basement,

376
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:20,502
and post two officers outside.

377
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:42,068
Charles, around the corner. You come with me.
Eyes on the crowd.

378
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,695
Subway! Woods,
let's check the subway.

379
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,762
Nothin' here.
- Let's go.

380
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:22,563
Sir, we can't find him.
- Come on, people.

381
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:36,679
Sir, how long have you been in contact with Nicholas Sloan?
- No comment.

382
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:39,983
Is that his daughter?
- No comment! I wanna get her home.

383
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:44,539
Fugitive terrorist Nicholas Sloan had apparently
been practicing law in Albany for three decades,

384
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:49,361
under the name James Grant, before he was exposed
recently by a reporter from the Albany Sun-Times.

385
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:52,288
This shit should already be over.
We need better intel.

386
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,804
We've grilled the brother.

387
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:57,581
Have we gotten anything out of Sharon Solarz?
- No, she's refusing to talk.

388
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:00,154
She'll talk to the local reporter,
she's already said.

389
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:06,367
Well, what do we know about him?
- He's... nothing reporter, local.

390
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:09,710
Okay... let's get him in.

391
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:16,815
Can you try and pull it together?
- Of course.

392
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm serious. Cornelius is already pissed.
- Yeah.

393
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:26,695
Hello there.
- I'm Special Agent Cornelius, you must be Shepherd.

394
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:27,751
Yep.

395
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:31,867
The prisoner is considered dangerous,
you do not accept anything from her.

396
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:36,480
No letters, packages, or messages of any kind.
Your time starts now.

397
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:46,789
Hello.
- Wow, you're much younger than I thought you'd be.

398
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,999
Well, that's always nice to hear.

399
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:51,515
I didn't mean it as a compliment.

400
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,487
Well... still, thank you.
- You did me a favor when you wrote that article.

401
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,593
I wouldn't mistake it for sympathy.

402
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,240
No... just clarity.

403
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,175
Yeah... clarity.
So, let's talk clarity.

404
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:10,329
Okay.

405
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:13,130
You were on your way to
New York to turn yourself in?

406
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:18,916
How does Billy Cusimano fit in?
- Billy's my friend, and he did nothing but encourage me to...

407
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:22,224
turn myself in if I thought that
that would bring me peace.

408
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:28,793
Mmm... you know his phone was tapped?
- Yeah. They got lucky.

409
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,794
And you got unlucky.
- Yeah.

410
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:37,006
Why now, after thirty years?

411
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:43,474
You don't have kids, do you?
- No, I... I barely have furniture.

412
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:47,111
Well, if you do, you
realize that they change you.

413
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:52,876
I have two, a boy and a girl...
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:58,995
and I waited until I thought they were
old enough to be able to handle it,

415
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:03,676
but still young enough that... I can...

416
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,645
So was it a crisis of conscience?

417
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,142
Hmm?

418
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,916
Remorse for past transgressions
that became intolerable?

419
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,978
The past thirty years in a sentence! Ha.

420
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,006
Wow, it must be nice to see
the world so cleanly.

421
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,506
Didn't you once?

422
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:41,219
Most of us led very sheltered lives,
we had no real relationship with violence.

423
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:48,095
But at that time, all these...
kids were... taking to the streets

424
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:53,112
in, uh, Japan, and France, China, Angola,

425
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:56,905
There was revolution, and I
wanted to be part of it.

426
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,081
Sure! Sounds groovy.

427
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:07,581
You think we were all just a...
bunch of doped up hippies running around.

428
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,581
It was hardly groovy,

429
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:15,421
our government was murdering millions,
and we could see...

430
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:19,809
horrifying images, on the news... magazines,

431
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:22,582
My Lai, Selma...

432
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:25,154
made us crazy, we didn't know what to do, we...

433
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:31,814
we, uh, protested, we sat in, we got our sculls cracked

434
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:34,922
and the war just kept escalating.

435
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:39,603
And then there was Kent State, and Jackson State, and...

436
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:46,128
kids our age... were being murdered
by our government... on campuses.

437
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,937
It's not our finest hour.
- It wasn't abstract, there was a draft.

438
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:58,529
You would've gotten a number, and then...
all you could do is just wait.

439
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:07,785
And everybody knew somebody that was going over,
or somebody who was not coming back.

440
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:10,321
You never get over that.
- Apparently not.

441
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:14,639
It sounds to me like justification,

442
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:19,012
I find it hard to believe that the only
option available to you at the time was violence.

443
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:25,408
Well, we thought that sitting at home while your government
committed genocide and doing nothing about it, that that was violence.

444
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:33,388
What about you?

445
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,641
What are you willing to take a risk for?

446
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:44,356
I don't know. I know that I wouldn't
blow up a building. I wouldn't kill anybody for anything.

447
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:49,889
Yeah, well... dissent can be dicey.

448
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:53,789
But you can't get to my age
without some regrets.

449
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,990
Would you do it again?

450
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:08,991
If... I didn't have kids,
and old parents that I love,

451
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,811
Yeah, I would do it again.

452
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:19,592
Smarter, better... different.

453
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,392
But I'd do it, yeah.

454
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:31,132
We made mistakes,
but we were right.

455
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:37,037
Hmm... and is Nick Sloan right?

456
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:41,312
He has a daughter much younger than yours,
that he abandoned in a hotel room.

457
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,409
People do what they have to do.
- Well, what are you doing then, here

458
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,317
with me? I mean, you...
you had a choice in all this after all.

459
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:54,719
Well, look at me. It doesn't matter what I say, unless...
I say it to somebody who's interested in the truth.

460
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:02,896
And it seems, as if you're interested in the truth.
Most people aren't.

461
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:09,095
What are you gonna do?
- My job.

462
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,096
Good.

463
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:24,321
And what do you think Jim... Nick...
what do you think he's doing now?

464
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:31,498
Maybe you should figure that out.
- Hmm.

465
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:38,425
Look, if my coming here in
any way was responsible for...

466
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:43,338
him being found out, well that
was not my intention, and he knows that.

467
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:48,536
We never betrayed each other,
not once, any of us, over all these years,

468
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:53,615
and I'm not about to start now.

469
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,535
What about Mimi Lurie?

470
00:38:57,216 --> 00:39:01,175
Is she out there living a good, clean, productive life?
- Anything's possible.

471
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:04,453
Mimi and Nick...

472
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:07,936
were different.

473
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:11,628
Radicals? Yes.
But also lovers.

474
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,300
Did you ...
- Time's up, sir.

475
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:26,117
Thank you for talking to me.
- Thank you for listening.

476
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:42,414
They did unforgivable things,
but you gotta appreciate the commitment.

477
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:47,110
No, you don't. Appreciate the fact that the
bank guard they murdered had two small kids.

478
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,340
It's just hard to reconcile the woman with her past.

479
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:53,230
Sir, don't allow yourself to get spun by these people
- I don't "get spun."

480
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:55,615
Well, you've been pretty soft on her
from the very beginning.

481
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,028
We're the good guys here,
but you seem not to care.

482
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:01,716
You write an article that blasts my team
publicly for doing our jobs well,

483
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:04,531
and you make light of decent...
- No. No, I didn't blast anybody. She was turning herself in, that's her...

484
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,912
No! There was no deal. We had intel,
we tracked her, we made the arrest. Now...

485
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,017
Where's that article? We took a
thirty-year fugitive off the street,

486
00:40:11,027 --> 00:40:14,424
and would have gotten her partner if it
hadn't been for some two-bit journalist interfering...

487
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:16,066
Would you even know who he was,
if it wasn't for me?

488
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,814
Well, you do seem awfully tied in to these people,

489
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:25,105
Solarz only talks to you, you meet with
Sloan two days before he disappears,

490
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,426
Givin' him a big head-start, if not more...

491
00:40:27,907 --> 00:40:30,834
Perhaps you're a little more interesting
than I initially thought?

492
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:35,406
We're bringing these people down,
and I hope I don't find you in my way.

493
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:39,123
Agent, I need you to report to an OPR review.

494
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:43,208
Don't ever ask me for anything again.

495
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,624
What are you talking about? I thought we were bonding?
- I feel like I just watched you get hypnotised in there...

496
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:50,612
"I was just young, female, and opposing injustice"?
That's her justification? That was offensive!

497
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,137
I'm not arguing that point...

498
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,611
Where are you guys on the Sloan thing?
You think you're gonna find him?

499
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:57,813
I think he knows how to run,
which means he has an advantage.

500
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:02,137
Terrorists justify terrorism, Ben.
Don't get confused here.

501
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:44,233
Don't tell me you have to go
when you don't have to go!

502
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:23,252
- Hello?
- This is Ben Shepherd, Albany Sun-Times.

503
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:25,666
- Yes?

504
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:29,553
- Dr. Sloan, I've spoken directly to your
brother. I've spoken to Sharon Solarz...

505
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,056
Yes?
- I have something to tell you, sir...

506
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:35,033
it's important that we speak.
- Go ahead... be quick.

507
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:38,842
Two minutes, but not over the phone.
I don't trust phones... yours or mine, for that matter.

508
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:45,034
You get here before ten.
- Perfect! Thank you, sir.

509
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:51,515
Yes, we are currently outside the home of Dr. Daniel Sloan,
brother of fugitive Nick Sloan.

510
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,739
We have no new information to report at this time,
but we are continuing to monitor the situation...

511
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,039
Ben Shepherd.
-Yeah?

512
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:58,245
Albany Sun-Times.
-Yeah...

513
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:01,526
Maulik Banjali of Reuters...
- Hey! What's goin' on?

514
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:02,828
No interviews.

515
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,749
No interviews?
- Yeah.

516
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:09,827
Hi, uh... Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times,

517
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:13,377
Dr. Sloan's expecting to see me?
- Yes, he is, sir. You can go right up.

518
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,338
Thank you.

519
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:24,513
Dr. Sloan, Ben Shepard. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Ah, yeah...

520
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,242
Thank you.

521
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,129
Beautiful...

522
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,042
So, uh... tell me what you need to tell me.

523
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:39,202
W... uh... We sh...
Okay, um...

524
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:42,947
Well, your brother obviously counted on you a great deal...

525
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:46,567
Were you two close growing up?
- He was my older brother,

526
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:51,666
I looked up to him. I was a kid,
I didn't understand what he was doing.

527
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:58,135
You said you had something to tell me.
- I'm just trying to figure out why you're helping him?

528
00:43:58,232 --> 00:44:01,839
Well, I'm helping my niece,
she's innocent in all this.

529
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,724
And your brother?

530
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,352
They blew up buildings.
It's been well-documented.

531
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:08,868
Do you approve of that?
- Of course not.

532
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:13,837
Now, if you have nothing more to ask, I think that...
- Do you think he's coming back for his daughter?

533
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,224
Is that what he's doing?
- Excuse me?

534
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:20,525
I'm trying to understand his thinking process.
I mean, why not take his daughter with him?

535
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,625
You know, why not change his name and disappear?
He obviously knows how to do that.

536
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:27,425
You said you had something to tell me.
Obviously, that's not the case.

537
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:30,774
So, I think we're done here.
We didn't ask for this.

538
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:33,742
I don't condone what he did...

539
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,338
and I certainly don't appreciate you
manipulating your way into my house.

540
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:39,774
You need to leave.
- Are you enrolling her in school?

541
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,036
'Cause I tell you, this situation doesn't
look like a permanent situation to me,

542
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:46,189
and I'm guessing not to you either.

543
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:49,053
So, what is he doin'?

544
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:53,373
Buying himself time for something.
- I dunno, for what?

545
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,965
I don't know, I'm asking you.

546
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:02,497
Your brother's nothing if he's not logical.
And right now, nothing he's doing...

547
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,849
makes any sense if he's guilty.

548
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,337
Help yourself...

549
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:59,594
You know... you should...
Holy shit!

550
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:05,554
It's right over here, lumber yard.

551
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,538
Don't worry, nobody's watching.

552
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:17,335
They're on Daniel.
They'll get to you, soon enough.

553
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:21,060
Yeah, well... anyone works for me
is an ex-con anyway.

554
00:46:21,836 --> 00:46:24,432
Boy, this is some operation you got here.
- Yeah...

555
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:29,073
Yeah... ya' got redwood, ya' got
pine, and cedar in there...

556
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:34,356
Western Red Cedar... you can smell it.
It's a fire meth(?) and certified.

557
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:37,144
Yeah, I can see you're still into
herbal teas and soy products.

558
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:41,849
Yeah, well, you know... I quit drinkin'
and smokin', and I gained weight, and I...

559
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:47,137
Aw, shit man, why am I tellin' you this?
I don't belong to the collective anymore.

560
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:51,654
I don't answer to you!
- I need a place to stay the night,

561
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:54,237
and a couple of questions answered, Donal.

562
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:01,240
Okay, crash at my place.

563
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,939
Hey, it's this...
This truck

564
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:14,367
That guy looks a little bit like Rick! Remember him?
The roadie from Monterrey?

565
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:18,249
That IS Rick, the roadie from Monterrey.

566
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,368
Jesus... I thought he'd died.
- We all died, some of us came back.

567
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,305
Keep in touch with anybody else?
- A few...

568
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:39,242
Steve and Penny, Carol... they're in New York, and, uh...

569
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:42,533
now, who else? Let's see...
Oh, I'd go visit Noah, you know?

570
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,742
Oh yeah?
- Yeah, he's in Lompoc, y' know.

571
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:47,522
I see him couple times a year, and, uh...

572
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,242
Little Sweeney and, uh, Laura Horse...
- Do you know where she is, Donal?

573
00:47:54,296 --> 00:47:55,425
- Nah, man, I don't.

574
00:47:55,426 --> 00:47:59,148
- After the bank, Sharon came to you for help.
- Really? How do you know that?

575
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:01,984
Because of the name she lived under
before she married her current husband.

576
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:04,945
It was in the papers
when she was arrested,

577
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:08,660
Coyle. And that was you
when you went under in '72.

578
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:13,347
I figured you got married and...
gave her a new identity, and then

579
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:17,709
she went somewhere else, and then after a couple of
years you gave an uncontested divorce,

580
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:18,670
and left her with a name.

581
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:22,093
Right? Am I right?

582
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:25,881
Did Mimi come to you, too?
- Well now, why would Mimi come to me?

583
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:31,153
You know, I'm...
Shit, man, this is a real shit-kicker of a questionin'...

584
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:38,547
and to show up and ask me to trust you with information
that makes me an accessory to murder?

585
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,763
Neither of them had any fuckin' right to
ask me a thing... and neither do you.

586
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:47,555
I mean, I was a-wind of you guys for the B and M, and
I wasn't even on a damn committee!

587
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,451
I was the fuck out of it, and...
- Did she come to you, or not?

588
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:52,447
Alright... alright...
- Just tell me, for christ's sake.

589
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:58,775
You know better than anyone... Mimi was not
going to be some kind of suburban housewife,

590
00:48:58,872 --> 00:49:01,848
drive a min-van
and go to the PTA!

591
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,456
She was gonna live or die a freedom fighter!

592
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:11,184
...married to the movement. Y' know, the last I heard
about her, she was on her way to Cuba.

593
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:24,010
Ten houses down, the one with the green windows...
but go around to the side, to the kitchen.

594
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:30,467
And what about you?

595
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,184
Why didn't you come to me for help, back then?

596
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:40,152
I didn't wanna go too far.
- Too far? What, you stayed?

597
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:48,172
Yeah, for a while. I thought she might come back.
- Who? Lurie? Come back?

598
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:53,957
Ah come on, get real, man! Mimi Lurie
is nothing but a dream you once had.

599
00:50:22,851 --> 00:50:26,358
Afternoon, ma'am.
Are you aware you're inside the shipping lane?

600
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:32,282
Oh so sorry, Captain, we're practicing for the Catalina Cup.
But we're too fast to get in anyone's way...

601
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:36,368
Roger that. Just stay east of 122.
- Aye, aye, Captain!

602
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:17,086
Hi, Teri!

603
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,576
Thank God for government bonds.

604
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,489
My accountant used to laugh at me for being risk averse.

605
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,672
Aw, don't give me that "capitalist dog" look.

606
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,979
Goin' legit has its advantages!

607
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:36,687
Sure! As long as bankrupting people's
pension funds remains legit,

608
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,273
And running good, honest weed remains... criminal?

609
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:47,890
You're gonna wanna look at that.
I saved it for ya'.

610
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:55,522
Sharon Solarz... a housewife in Vermont, do you believe it?
- Shit.

611
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,562
And Billy Cusimano...

612
00:51:58,063 --> 00:52:00,463
Who?
- From the Brotherhood.

613
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:04,006
Nice to know ol' Billy's
keeping the flame alive.

614
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:14,263
And Nick Sloan... a lawyer from Albany.
Christ, how'd he manage to pull that one off?

615
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,984
It's what he always wanted.

616
00:52:17,348 --> 00:52:19,981
As I recall, you two were pretty tight.

617
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:23,092
I don't know, it was a long time ago.

618
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:28,197
So, why do you think she decided to
turn herself in after all these years?

619
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:30,709
I don't know, Mac.

620
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:35,586
Guess she got tired.
- Yeah.

621
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,362
Times change, babe.

622
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:41,694
Tabs, maybe.

623
00:52:43,398 --> 00:52:48,298
Mr. McGowan, this is Ben Shepard calling
again from the Albany Sun-Times newspaper...

624
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:53,086
uh, as I said, this is regarding the research that we're
doing on the Bank of Michigan robbery...

625
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:58,868
and I would appreciate a call back,
uh, my number is 518-555-1218.

626
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:14,817
Hello?

627
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:41,598
You're not gonna believe what just happened to me.
FBI was in my apartment.

628
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:44,996
I don't need this right now.
- Look, a search warrant. No probable cause, that's a story, right?

629
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:47,399
That's not a story.
- They're pissed because I'm doing their job better than they are.

630
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:50,350
Well, you know how to make friends, don't you?
- It's not about making friends! It's about making history!

631
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:51,978
I'm talkin' about history...

632
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:55,620
- I got your request...

633
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:57,905
I can't send you to Michigan.

634
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:01,092
You have to send me to Michigan, she's being indicted in Michigan.
- We'll get it from the wires.

635
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:04,896
No, wires are shit. This is big, I'm putting us on the map.
People know my name, Ray. You have to send me out there!

636
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:08,700
Hey. Hey! Have some fuckin' awareness.
Okay? This isn't all about you.

637
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:10,222
I just laid off my sports department.

638
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:13,377
Well, who gives a shit about Albany High girls soccer?
I mean, what are we talking about here...?

639
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,694
Don't be an asshole.
- I'm not being an asshole.

640
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:16,521
Why are you acting like we're not killing it right now?

641
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:20,615
I'm on the fuckin' 10-yard line! I'm on the
10-yard line and you're stopping me right now.

642
00:54:21,286 --> 00:54:22,559
That's a bad article.

643
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:24,698
- It's a bad arti... it's an exclusive
with the guy's brother! It's a bad article...

644
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,099
You took a shot at him, you made it personal.

645
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,130
He's a shmuck, Ray!
- I don't fucking care what he is!

646
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,311
That's not what we do!
And this is not the first time!

647
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,992
You don't just destroy someone to see
if you can uncover something!

648
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:38,595
That's a shitty way to go about things!
Got it?

649
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:40,503
The fact that we are even having
this conversation is ridiculous.

650
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:43,403
I gave you an exclusive with Sharon Solarz,
I gave you an exclusive with the guy's brother.

651
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:46,820
Nick Sloan would still be defending spotted owls if it
wasn't for me. Nobody can do what I am doing, Ray.

652
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,689
Alan Springer, returning.
- I gotta call him back.

653
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:53,599
I'm in this in a big way, I need support now, Ray.
I need you to support me.

654
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:57,841
And you need to stop provoking people.
Especially the FBI! Okay?

655
00:54:58,034 --> 00:54:59,282
Okay.

656
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:03,418
I got bosses too, you know.

657
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:13,111
So, what are you thinkin'?

658
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:14,831
You know, I'm still wrapping my head around it.

659
00:55:14,832 --> 00:55:17,040
These people are... they're all nuts,
but none of 'em are illogical.

660
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:21,755
You know, if this man is trying to escape,
if he was trying to disappear,

661
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:23,003
he'd have taken his daughter with him.

662
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,328
Maybe.
- But he didn't.

663
00:55:25,808 --> 00:55:28,718
Instead, he conducts a very risky and
complicated series of switches,

664
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:32,235
gets his daughter in safekeeping,
gets to New York. By himself, alone.

665
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:36,711
Which changes everything, right? I mean, if the guy is
innocent, and he's running because he's innocent,

666
00:55:36,808 --> 00:55:38,716
why doesn't Sharon just clear him?

667
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:41,804
Because she's in custody and she was his partner,
and that doesn't hold up in court.

668
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:45,096
Yeah, but why, why, why, why hide for thirty years
if you're innocent, y' know?

669
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:46,600
Innocence only gets you so far.

670
00:55:46,697 --> 00:55:48,312
Michigan number.
This is where it all started!

671
00:55:48,313 --> 00:55:51,122
'Cause you're not going to Michigan.
- Ben Shepherd.

672
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:55,282
Mr. McGowan!
Thank you for calling me b...

673
00:55:57,803 --> 00:56:00,943
Yes. I'm sorry for your loss.

674
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:04,627
Okay. Bye bye.

675
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,588
(Fuck!)

676
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:58,293
Donal?
Donal!

677
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:20,744
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

678
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,141
What are you doing, man?

679
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:26,288
What are YOU doing?

680
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:29,389
I went to get you a car.
- Aw, shit.

681
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:35,390
What? You thought I ran out on ya'?

682
00:57:35,906 --> 00:57:41,605
I thought, maybe you realized what a risk you
were taking, for a guy you hardly know.

683
00:57:41,703 --> 00:57:47,215
Hey, do you remember? We used to be best of friends.
You remember that?

684
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:52,765
Yep.

685
00:57:53,342 --> 00:57:57,023
Here's the key. It's clean.
It'll get you out of town, at least.

686
00:58:03,703 --> 00:58:07,899
Call the cops in the morning. Tell 'em I
came to see you asking for help,

687
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,293
and you refused 'cause you're
an upstanding, law-abiding citizen.

688
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:17,305
Oh Jeez...
Alright, now listen to me...

689
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:22,229
Mimi did come to me,
I put her in touch with Jed Lewis.

690
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:26,909
He made some introductions.
Political friends... in Havana.

691
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,923
Jed Louis!
- Yeah.

692
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:34,495
I thought Jed was above ground. How can he ge....
- No! No, no, no. He's got the list, so he can find her.

693
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:38,595
Alright. Fuckin' run, man.

694
00:58:56,904 --> 00:59:01,244
A security guard is dead after a robbery
turned violent in Briarwood Mall.

695
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:05,316
At five minutes after 8 a.m.
a man and a women, masked and armed,

696
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:08,017
entered the local branch
of the Bank of Michigan.

697
00:59:08,114 --> 00:59:12,337
An exchange of gunfire occurred between
the suspects and bank security guard Hugh Kroessna,

698
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:16,160
pronounced dead at the scene.
According to investigating officer Henry Osborne,

699
00:59:16,257 --> 00:59:19,118
the investigation
is considered active and ongoing.

700
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:28,022
Osborne...
- Hello.

701
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:31,622
Hi! My name's Ben Shepard. I'm calling
from the Albany Sun Times newspaper.

702
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:34,527
Albany, New York.
- I should hope so.

703
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,519
I left a couple messages, um...
I'm trying to locate police chief Henry Osborne?

704
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,831
Former police chief.

705
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:45,311
Yeah... well, I just wanted to ask him a couple of questions
regarding the recent Sharon Solarz arrest?

706
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,551
He is still...?
- Alive?

707
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:49,824
Well, yeah.

708
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:52,473
Well, he'd better be, or I'm on my way
to the yacht club to see a ghost!

709
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:58,529
See, I'm here in Detroit
doing some research, and...

710
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:02,137
from my understanding his department was pretty
involved in the Bank of Michigan investigation,

711
01:00:02,138 --> 01:00:04,142
I just wanted to ask him a couple of questions about that.

712
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:06,938
But he's not here right now.
- Well, I'm just doin' a little background...

713
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:08,746
But he's still not here.

714
01:00:09,614 --> 01:00:12,430
Well, how about this? Can I give you my number,
and then maybe you can pass it to him?

715
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:15,823
I'd really appreciate it, I'm quite harmless.
- Really?

716
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:20,814
The number is 518-555-1218.

717
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:24,061
That's my office and I'm calling you from my cell.
Thanks for your time.

718
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:28,636
The manhunt for Nicholas Sloan continues
at this time in Milwaukee

719
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:32,863
where former Weather Underground member
Donald Fitzgerald was taken into custody today.

720
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:37,133
Federal authorities suspect Mr. Fitzgerald
of aiding and abetting Nicholas Sloan

721
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:40,028
who continues to elude Federal investigators.

722
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:44,232
Nick went to Donal,
he's trying to find me.

723
01:00:44,329 --> 01:00:47,504
You're safe here, you can lie low.

724
01:00:49,518 --> 01:00:50,866
You know I counted last night,

725
01:00:52,118 --> 01:00:55,247
I've walked out on six lives...

726
01:00:56,022 --> 01:01:01,623
Six sets of friends... six lovers...
six homes, six names...

727
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:03,719
..not including my own.

728
01:01:03,823 --> 01:01:06,143
So, you moving on again?
- Mm-hmm.

729
01:01:06,823 --> 01:01:11,948
You wanna take the boat?
- Uh-uh... No, I'm going inland.

730
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:17,131
Well, door's always open.
- Thanks, Mac.

731
01:01:22,628 --> 01:01:25,736
You submit one goddamn receipt from
this trip, and you're fired on the spot.

732
01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:27,924
Yeah, right, like you haven't said that before.

733
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:29,961
Don't fuck with me, Ben.
I'm not in the mood.

734
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:34,056
So, are you in Milwaukee?
- No, I'm in Michigan.

735
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:38,029
Your guy was spotted in Milwaukee.
- I know that, I saw it on the news.

736
01:01:38,317 --> 01:01:42,341
And here I thought we were the news.
- Look, I'm workin' on it, Ray, alright? I'm bustin' my ass.

737
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:45,197
Good. You got 24 hours to get me something
and you can keep your job.

738
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:46,926
No shit. My job that doesn't pay?

739
01:01:46,926 --> 01:01:49,554
Yeah, that one! And you're lucky to have it.
- 'Kay.

740
01:01:55,623 --> 01:02:00,163
Mr. Osborne?
Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times.

741
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:07,158
You're a long way from Albany, Mr. Shepard.
- Well, phones don't work so well out there...

742
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:10,664
You're a hard man to pin down.
- Apparently not.

743
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,035
Do you mind? There are proper channels,
what with my friends and family here.

744
01:02:14,036 --> 01:02:15,554
I'm sorry, I know it's an intrusion,

745
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,865
I just didn't want to disturb you at home.

746
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:21,970
What?
- Can I speak to you, please sir?

747
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,729
Excuse me...
- Thank you.

748
01:02:32,222 --> 01:02:34,430
Now, what is it you're here for?

749
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:38,854
Well, sir, I was just hoping I could ask you a couple of questions
regarding the Bank of Michigan investigation.

750
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,534
That was a long time ago.
- But you watch the news,

751
01:02:41,535 --> 01:02:44,607
I'm sure you're aware Sharon Solarz has
been brought back to Michigan to stand trial.

752
01:02:45,088 --> 01:02:47,033
Nick Sloan has been identified and is on the run.

753
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:48,346
I am aware.

754
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,260
How involved was your department
with the Bank of Michigan investigation?

755
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,855
Well, this is all in the public record.

756
01:02:54,828 --> 01:02:56,148
What about before that?

757
01:02:56,636 --> 01:03:00,047
My understanding is, you covered the campus.
Y' know, pretty active, right?

758
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:03,432
You ever come in contact with Mimi Lurie
or Nick Sloan before they went underground?

759
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,559
No. I- I'm sorry, what is it you're
trying to get answered?

760
01:03:06,656 --> 01:03:09,064
You know, maybe if I knew
the question I could better help.

761
01:03:09,072 --> 01:03:11,873
Well, I'm... I'm just trying to
understand the evidence of the case.

762
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,244
Sharon Solarz was a teller,

763
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,847
she went through the training program,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

764
01:03:16,942 --> 01:03:18,758
But when you get to the others,
that's where I get lost.

765
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:22,962
Mimi Lurie, Nick Sloan, Vince Dallesandro,
that's where it starts getting blurry for me.

766
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:27,037
Does it? Dallesandro's prints were on the gun,

767
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:29,649
he got caught a couple of days later
on an anonymous tip.

768
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,746
He testified against the others.
He was already on parole.

769
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:36,393
He ended up dying in prison, or him getting killed,
killing himself, depending on who's report you believe.

770
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:38,231
Others were all fugitives at the time,

771
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:40,868
I heard they were wanted by the FBI,
already underground,

772
01:03:41,444 --> 01:03:45,278
they knew how to disappear and they did.
- Yeah, it's just this time I think he's doing something different.

773
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:48,164
Why should this time be any
different than before?

774
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:53,951
Well, this time I don't think he's running away.
This time, I think he's trying to clear his name.

775
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,957
Uh, how do you think he's gonna do that?
- I was hoping you could help me there.

776
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:00,565
Ha, not sure how.

777
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:04,168
The getaway car was his car,
his prints were all over it.

778
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:07,950
There was testimony that he was there...
- So...?

779
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:10,722
What am I missing?

780
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:15,748
Hi, Dad!
- Hey! Alright, sweetie.

781
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:19,066
How are ya'?
- How ya' doin'? I'm Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times.

782
01:04:19,643 --> 01:04:21,543
My wife, Marianne,
and my daughter, Rebecca.

783
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,963
Albany Sun-Times in Albany, New York?
- Are you just passing through, Mr. Shepard?

784
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:26,696
Ah... he's just leaving.

785
01:04:28,905 --> 01:04:30,249
I'll be right there.

786
01:04:30,636 --> 01:04:35,843
So, I'm gonna be headed to... uh...
um... Ann Arbor for a couple of days

787
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,956
and I was just wondering if maybe we
could sit down for another 5 minutes?

788
01:04:39,436 --> 01:04:41,888
Alright, I'll be headed back to town
in a couple of days myself,

789
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:46,836
guess you got my number.
- Perfect. Thank you, sir.

790
01:05:05,562 --> 01:05:08,147
Yeah, hello.
- How is she?

791
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:10,875
She's safe, she's right here.

792
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:15,972
Listen, Eva is afraid the apartment's under surveillance.
- I'm sure it is.

793
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:20,955
We snuck out the service entrance
and came to the park,

794
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,188
and I can't guarantee we weren't followed.

795
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:29,969
Can I speak to her?
- Hold on, hold on... Izzy!

796
01:05:36,744 --> 01:05:39,961
Where are you?
- Honey, you don't need to know that right now.

797
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:43,053
But why can't you just tell me?

798
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:46,953
Izzy, all I wanna know is...
are you okay?

799
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:49,254
Everyone is so mad at you.

800
01:05:49,353 --> 01:05:52,241
How 'bout you? You mad at me?
- Where are you?

801
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,866
I'm trying to get back to you as soon as I can.

802
01:05:55,347 --> 01:05:59,850
Got 'im! Just off I-94 near Gurnee, Illinois.
- Send the coordinates to the field.

803
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,367
I know, and it won't be long.
- Done!

804
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,067
You have a full green light.

805
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:09,748
Still tracking?
- Yep.

806
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:13,451
He's cooked.
- Okay, send Bravo team down...

807
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:14,969
Did you kill that man?

808
01:06:15,548 --> 01:06:18,041
Did I...?
- Kill him? That man at the bank.

809
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:20,352
Of course not.
- Then why'd you have to leave?

810
01:06:20,545 --> 01:06:23,870
Honey, one day soon you're gonna
understand everything, I promise.

811
01:06:24,062 --> 01:06:28,722
I don't want you to grow up and look back
on what I did and feel bad, ever! Okay?

812
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:33,660
But now you're gonna have to help me.
You gotta be strong.

813
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:37,047
And then next time, you and I will go
somewhere together

814
01:06:37,822 --> 01:06:43,367
Alright? Anywhere you like.
- Home would be fine.

815
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:48,563
Gotta go...

816
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:54,355
I love you.
You do know that, right?

817
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:09,994
Hi. Ben Shepard, we met on the stairs?
- Oh right, yeah, I remember.

818
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:16,541
You don't look much like your parents.
- I was adopted... so, no.

819
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:20,265
If that was your pick-up line, it needs work.
- Mind if I sit?

820
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:21,870
I am on a date.
- Oh, you're on a date?

821
01:08:21,871 --> 01:08:23,119
Yeah.
- Yeah?

822
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:26,178
Kinda like that thing real people do.
- Yes, that.

823
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:31,570
Given your manners, I am really surprised my dad
doesn't want to spend more time with you.

824
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:35,608
What? What are you talking about? Me and your dad are good!
We're playing poker night, takin' in the Pistons game tomorrow.

825
01:08:36,952 --> 01:08:38,299
Fun.

826
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:43,896
Can I take you to dinner?

827
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,979
Excuse me?
- Right! No...

828
01:08:47,268 --> 01:08:49,287
you're right, coffee then?
What d'ya think?

829
01:08:49,577 --> 01:08:52,788
I think that my date is on his way back,
and you should leave.

830
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:54,588
Not until we figure this out, coffee or dinner?

831
01:08:55,356 --> 01:08:57,285
Persistent.
- Professional hazard.

832
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,565
Coffee or...?
- Coffee, if you leave right now.

833
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:01,369
Okay, fine... deal.
Time? Place?

834
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:04,977
Caf?at the Union, 2:30.
- Okay. You know this guy's not right for you.

835
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,374
Says you...

836
01:09:10,466 --> 01:09:15,063
Who was that?
- A friend of my dad's.

837
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,179
Chance, someone once said... don't remember who...

838
01:09:20,283 --> 01:09:23,775
Chance is a nickname for providence.

839
01:09:25,147 --> 01:09:28,772
Well, it's another way of saying...
that all history is inevitable.

840
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,380
Because it goes to the trouble of happening.

841
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:36,583
Another point of view says that history
is independent of individual will,

842
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,915
determined by social conditions and relations of production,

843
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:43,193
relations of production? We remember that...
there he is, Karl Marx.

844
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:49,476
Now, these theories propose
a history immune to effort,

845
01:09:49,573 --> 01:09:52,583
removed from the choices of everyday life.

846
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:58,558
But history...
is made by human beings!

847
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:05,872
And action... and passion...
no less than fate, or economics,

848
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,774
are it's essential ingredients.

849
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:12,071
Go! Go, go go...
But come back tomorrow!

850
01:10:12,663 --> 01:10:14,980
Because we'll be discussing Fanon.

851
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,197
Enjoyed your lecture.
- Thank you.

852
01:10:28,968 --> 01:10:32,469
"Action and passion"
sounds like something a friend of mine used to say.

853
01:10:35,053 --> 01:10:37,165
No... No, no, no, no...

854
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:39,598
Need to talk to you, Big Jake.
- Go to hell.

855
01:10:41,577 --> 01:10:44,581
How dare you show up here!
- Where else could I go?

856
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:48,282
You're takin' a hell of a chance.
- Not by choice.

857
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:52,086
They're probably watching me.
Unlike you, they know who I am.

858
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:55,182
How's that workin' out, by the way?
- Fuck you...

859
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:56,691
I have a life.

860
01:10:57,766 --> 01:11:01,375
I was hoping for a little bit more,
"Hey, Nick, old friend! How are ya'?"

861
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:04,980
"How ya' been these past thirty-odd years?"
- For christ's sake, Nick...

862
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:08,079
I'm a public figure, do you know
the position you're putting me in here?

863
01:11:08,272 --> 01:11:11,075
Nancy would forgive me banging a
Freshman sooner than talking to you.

864
01:11:11,172 --> 01:11:14,275
You're still with Nan?
- Yeah, some of us made it work.

865
01:11:14,372 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah, some of you got lucky.

866
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,905
It wasn't luck.
- Well, what was then?

867
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:22,605
Jed...
what was it?

868
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:25,685
We didn't kill anybody.

869
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:30,562
Jed, I need to find Mimi.
- Looking for a girl? They got websites for that sort of thing.

870
01:11:31,278 --> 01:11:33,310
What makes you think I know where she is?

871
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:39,030
Donal told you... fuck!

872
01:11:39,798 --> 01:11:40,951
Fuck!

873
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,277
Does it matter?

874
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:44,182
Jed, does it matter?

875
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:49,579
Look, the truth? I haven't talked to Mimi
since bell-bottoms went out of style, okay?

876
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:52,808
I mean, how do you know she's even still alive?
- I don't.

877
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:55,979
Why would I help you after all these years?
We didn't even agree back then.

878
01:11:56,076 --> 01:11:59,079
Because Mimi's the only person
who can help me get my daughter back.

879
01:11:59,872 --> 01:12:02,479
You got a daughter?
- Yes.

880
01:12:05,276 --> 01:12:06,612
No shit?

881
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:39,788
Mimi Lurie...

882
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:46,563
and Henry Osborne.

883
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,676
It doesn't make sense.

884
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:15,790
Where are you going?

885
01:13:26,587 --> 01:13:28,535
Let's go. You can
walk me to class.

886
01:13:28,727 --> 01:13:29,976
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

887
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,132
So, tell me about yourself.
- Peace Corp for a bit,

888
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,703
thought I was gonna change the world,

889
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,116
decided it was actually people
who needed changing,

890
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:46,121
went back to school to study psychology,
turns out psychology has nothing to do with that,

891
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:49,920
ended up in New York, for a bit...

892
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:52,915
I guess I thought I was gonna change myself,

893
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:55,704
turns out I'm too stubborn.

894
01:13:55,897 --> 01:13:57,532
You must be older than I thought.

895
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:02,914
So, what happens now?
If in doubt, you go back to law school?

896
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:07,609
I'm not in doubt.
It's my mom, she's a judge.

897
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:13,208
Really? So was mine!
Just not professionally.

898
01:14:18,896 --> 01:14:20,311
You like Michigan?

899
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:22,903
I love it.

900
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,691
Okay, you...

901
01:14:25,884 --> 01:14:29,194
I read one of your articles online last night.
I read a couple of them, actually.

902
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,636
You're kidding me? Really?
And what'd you think?

903
01:14:33,384 --> 01:14:35,721
I think you broke a big story.
- I did!

904
01:14:36,882 --> 01:14:40,060
I think you're clinging to it like a life-raft.
- Oh, ho, ho.... wow.

905
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:41,703
and now it defines you.
- Wow!

906
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:44,625
Yeah, I do.
- Maybe psych's not a bad fit after all.

907
01:14:46,389 --> 01:14:48,506
I kinda call 'em like I see 'em.

908
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,321
Fair enough, call this one.
Your father's ignoring me, why?

909
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:54,930
I'm guessing because... he doesn't want to talk to you?

910
01:14:56,563 --> 01:14:59,610
Hmm...
- He's retired.

911
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:06,507
I mean, and this was decades ago.
He wants to fish, and watch boats on the water...

912
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:11,103
He's also not one for reminiscing.

913
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:14,617
You know he was close to the Lurie family?

914
01:15:15,788 --> 01:15:21,984
Yeah. Her dad and my granddad
were fishing buddies, I think.

915
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:27,384
Yeah, so I heard.
- Yeah, they used to go up to the Linder Woods in the U.P.

916
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,400
It's absolutely gorgeous
up there, you would hate it.

917
01:15:30,497 --> 01:15:33,106
The "U.P."?
- The upper peninsula.

918
01:15:34,398 --> 01:15:36,150
He told me he never met her.

919
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,696
Huh!

920
01:15:42,098 --> 01:15:45,889
Had to be hard, live with the Lurie name
after everything went down.

921
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:48,394
Yeah. I'm sure it was.

922
01:15:49,194 --> 01:15:50,935
You ever talk about her
when you were younger?

923
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:54,119
This was all way before my time.

924
01:16:01,499 --> 01:16:02,920
What are you thinking?

925
01:16:06,404 --> 01:16:09,212
Can I speak honestly with you for a second?
- Yeah.

926
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,228
People lie for two reasons.

927
01:16:12,612 --> 01:16:16,212
They speak unknowingly, a simple mistake, y' know.
Or they do it intentionally,

928
01:16:16,404 --> 01:16:19,324
and having met a known fugitive who's also
a family friend isn't something you would forget.

929
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,021
Mm... what are you getting at?

930
01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:24,237
In my business, when someone lies
intentionally, that's significant.

931
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:28,421
It seems your father lied to me,
I'm guessing it's some way to cover himself.

932
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:33,717
Look, Ben, I get that you're good
at your job, but so is my dad,

933
01:16:33,813 --> 01:16:37,506
and I would put the quality of his character
up against anyone in the world.

934
01:16:37,602 --> 01:16:41,282
So, if you're insinuating that he was
or is somehow involved in something

935
01:16:41,283 --> 01:16:45,818
that ends up in your paper? I would be damn sure
you know what you're talking about.

936
01:16:46,396 --> 01:16:48,618
I may be a student of the law, but that's libel,

937
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:51,139
and in my business, that's significant.

938
01:16:55,795 --> 01:16:57,180
I'd like to see you again!

939
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:04,324
Bye.

940
01:17:17,097 --> 01:17:19,314
Every sixth and seventh number.

941
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:22,634
How do I know who I'm calling?
- You don't.

942
01:17:24,455 --> 01:17:26,346
Okay.
- Good luck.

943
01:17:48,604 --> 01:17:52,333
Hi, this is, uh, John Smith,
I'm looking for a plumber.

944
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:56,697
Are you now?
- Yes, I am.

945
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:02,604
Wow, been a long time since I've heard that.
- Is this line clean?

946
01:18:02,702 --> 01:18:05,938
Babe, they didn't listen to me back then,
and they sure ain't listenin' to me now.

947
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:09,014
Who's calling?
- Nick Sloan.

948
01:18:10,397 --> 01:18:16,842
Nick Sloan? God, I just saw you on TV.
- Unless you wanna see yourself there too, we'd better hurry.

949
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:19,927
I need to get to Mimi Lurie.

950
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:26,616
Where are you?
- 845-555-8249.

951
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:31,516
Okay, I'll see if we still got the juice.

952
01:18:32,097 --> 01:18:33,531
Hang tight, brother.

953
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:50,121
You wanna hear somethin' funny?
I've been Jim Grant longer than I've been me.

954
01:18:50,312 --> 01:18:51,628
That's nice.

955
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,937
Come on, Jed, we're just talking here.

956
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:57,742
We don't need to talk.

957
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,934
I think we do, you're angry.
- You're damn right I am.

958
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:07,626
Jesus. Thirty years on, still holding a grudge, huh?

959
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:09,243
No...

960
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,826
it was the lack of respect.

961
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,627
You guys put everybody in danger.
We didn't kill anybody, we didn't hurt anyone.

962
01:19:16,914 --> 01:19:18,667
We were a peace movement,
for christ's sake!

963
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:22,739
People make mistakes, Jed.

964
01:19:24,936 --> 01:19:27,829
Then you turn yourself in and
atone for what you've done,

965
01:19:27,925 --> 01:19:30,552
and then you keep up the struggle
in any small way you can.

966
01:19:31,712 --> 01:19:33,237
You like what you're doing now?

967
01:19:34,209 --> 01:19:35,634
Yeah.

968
01:19:36,307 --> 01:19:39,844
Yeah! I like what I try to do...
I like my students.

969
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:42,118
Seems like it's mutual.

970
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:46,254
Yeah... I can still pack the hall when I...

971
01:19:48,005 --> 01:19:49,630
..talk about SDS.

972
01:19:51,306 --> 01:19:53,634
March on Washington,
trying to change the world,

973
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,635
they're drawn to it, I can tell.

974
01:19:56,611 --> 01:19:58,143
They just don't know
what to do with it.

975
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,155
I don't know why they would,
it's ancient history to them.

976
01:20:02,503 --> 01:20:03,635
So they listen and clap,

977
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:07,314
and then they update their Facebook
statuses and they forget all about it.

978
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,452
We've turned into our parents, Jed.
- Yeah,

979
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:12,868
now we're just a story told to children.

980
01:20:14,879 --> 01:20:18,368
Well, I'm glad someone's still telling it.

981
01:20:24,008 --> 01:20:26,639
- Yeah.
- You the guy that needs a plumber?

982
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:31,717
I am. Line clean?
- Thirty seconds to be safe.

983
01:20:31,814 --> 01:20:33,522
Mimi?
- Was here, yeah.

984
01:20:33,618 --> 01:20:35,242
Here?
- Big Sur.

985
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:38,125
Was?
- Left yesterday.

986
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:40,735
Say where going?
- North.

987
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:45,039
By boat?
- Woulda' made more sense, but she was headin' inland.

988
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:47,627
Got it.
- Good luck!

989
01:20:49,031 --> 01:20:50,595
She gone?

990
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:54,438
Yeah...
but I know where she's headed.

991
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:58,748
Hey? Thanks for everything.

992
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,755
You really want to thank me, Nick,
you'll never contact me again.

993
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:40,429
Everything we have on the reporter,
he's been in Michigan for two days.

994
01:21:40,623 --> 01:21:43,231
Background on people he's contacted
and places he's visited.

995
01:21:43,326 --> 01:21:45,468
Stay on him.
- Of course, sir. Travel safe.

996
01:22:02,025 --> 01:22:03,458
Can I see some ID, please?

997
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:08,240
Alright, thank you Mr. Haywood.
Have a good day.

998
01:22:17,731 --> 01:22:20,246
I'm looking for real estate records and plat maps?

999
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:25,555
Lurie family, Linder-Lurie Lumber,
and Linder Holdings... going back 50 years.

1000
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:29,247
Those three.

1001
01:22:32,826 --> 01:22:34,367
Agent Cornelius, welcome back...

1002
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:38,147
Right this way.

1003
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:52,352
So, where are the Linder Woods?
- I have no idea.

1004
01:22:53,629 --> 01:22:59,241
What about Drummond Island?
- It's up here, right across the water from Canada.

1005
01:22:59,533 --> 01:23:02,838
And this white part, this is private property, right?
- Beats me.

1006
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:07,242
I mean, it's not part of that... that conservancy,
or that preserve, or whatever that is?

1007
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:13,850
No... it doesn't look like it.
I don't see any sales, or state seizure reports.

1008
01:23:14,735 --> 01:23:17,569
But if this is privatly owned, somebody's
still paying taxes on this, right?

1009
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:19,755
I don't know.

1010
01:23:20,636 --> 01:23:22,455
Can I have copies of all this?
- Sure.

1011
01:23:54,605 --> 01:23:59,474
I'm standing outside the Ann Arbor courthouse
where Sharon Solarz entered a plea of "not guilty."

1012
01:23:59,956 --> 01:24:01,587
Judge Panomino remanded her without bail...

1013
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,653
Mr. Osbourne, can I speak to you?
- Not now.

1014
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,878
Not talking to me is a very
dangerous decision for you right now.

1015
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:13,531
Not here, I'll call you.
- Look, if I don't hear from you soon, this is...

1016
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:14,863
You will.

1017
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:19,357
Don't bother cleaning up,
we won't be here that long.

1018
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:28,874
You came.

1019
01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:39,680
You look older.

1020
01:26:42,848 --> 01:26:45,376
You look the same.
- Yeah, right.

1021
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,752
Mi, we gotta talk.
- So, talk.

1022
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,768
Come on, Mimi, is this the way
you're gonna play it?

1023
01:26:57,961 --> 01:27:00,456
Like we don't know each other?
Like I'm just some adversary?

1024
01:27:00,552 --> 01:27:02,558
Aren't you?
- Don't...

1025
01:27:02,606 --> 01:27:05,861
Okay, so why am I here?
Why did you smoke me out?

1026
01:27:05,862 --> 01:27:08,274
"Smoke you out"?
- You went to Donal.

1027
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,998
I had to.
- Well, I got the message, I'm here.

1028
01:27:14,346 --> 01:27:16,573
Nick, I can't help you,
that's why I'm here.

1029
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:19,582
I came to tell you.
I figured I owed you that.

1030
01:27:25,113 --> 01:27:26,362
Hmm.

1031
01:27:28,956 --> 01:27:31,862
I have a daughter.
- I know.

1032
01:27:33,052 --> 01:27:34,679
She's almost twelve.

1033
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:41,480
That's her.

1034
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,293
What's her name?
- Isabel.

1035
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:52,888
Your middle name, yeah.

1036
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:56,496
Didn't you love your wife?

1037
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:02,962
More than you can imagine.
- Oh, I can imagine...

1038
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:07,077
Look, I know this child. She's probably never gonna
get over what's happened to her already,

1039
01:28:07,271 --> 01:28:09,086
and she's got a whole life ahead of her.

1040
01:28:10,046 --> 01:28:12,591
So, I'm asking you just to...
- You're asking me

1041
01:28:13,363 --> 01:28:18,682
to give myself up, so I can
clear you, for the sake of the child.

1042
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:24,567
I see... everything to protect
the new little family.

1043
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:28,612
Fuck your principles, fuck anything
else you used to stand for?

1044
01:28:30,444 --> 01:28:33,671
Well, the struggle doesn't end
just because you got tired of it.

1045
01:28:33,768 --> 01:28:36,584
I didn't get tired of it,
I grew up.

1046
01:28:37,356 --> 01:28:40,712
We promised each other we weren't going to do that.
- Yeah, but it happened.

1047
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:47,336
I left the movement for the same
reason I joined it

1048
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:50,241
because I didn't want to see good people's
lives thrown away for nothing.

1049
01:28:52,478 --> 01:28:56,090
You've waited a long time
to tell me that, haven't you?

1050
01:28:57,762 --> 01:29:00,302
And you've been a long time
coming home from the bank.

1051
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,808
You were close to Mimi Lurie's family.

1052
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:11,087
I wouldn't say close,
my dad knew her dad.

1053
01:29:13,263 --> 01:29:17,471
You went to the same school, same church,
you went on fishing trips together.

1054
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:20,594
There's something you're not telling me.

1055
01:29:22,228 --> 01:29:23,472
What are you driving at, Shepard?

1056
01:29:23,472 --> 01:29:26,964
We know that Nick Sloan is looking
for something or someone to clear him.

1057
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,210
I know that's your assumption.
- Could that be Mimi Lurie?

1058
01:29:32,654 --> 01:29:33,969
I'm off the record.

1059
01:29:37,149 --> 01:29:40,869
Think it out. First he'd have to find
her, and convince her to testify.

1060
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:42,585
Second, she'd have to surrender.

1061
01:29:43,065 --> 01:29:45,504
But it's a participants testimony.
- That's the point.

1062
01:29:46,754 --> 01:29:51,570
If Mimi comes out of hiding, and surrenders herself
to testify that Nick Sloan wasn't at the bank,

1063
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,799
it's what lawyers call a declaration against interest.

1064
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:57,974
Destroys her own possibility of a defense.
It would clear him.

1065
01:29:58,071 --> 01:30:01,587
Why? Why would she do that? Why would she
give herself up to a jail sentence to save him?

1066
01:30:01,972 --> 01:30:04,571
I mean, what is her motivation?
You really she's gonna do that?

1067
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:06,007
Don't matter what we think.

1068
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:09,428
He obviously believes he can convince her.
- Why now?

1069
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,077
Why not do this back then?

1070
01:30:16,461 --> 01:30:18,093
How long have you known about this?

1071
01:30:20,169 --> 01:30:22,586
I'm obviously not the only person in this conversation

1072
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:26,022
who knows about her ties to a piece of
property just on the other side of Canada.

1073
01:30:28,429 --> 01:30:31,348
Mr. Osborne, what's the actual charge
against a law enforcement officer who

1074
01:30:31,349 --> 01:30:34,274
fails to follow credible evidence about
the whereabouts of a known fugitive?

1075
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,877
I think there'd be a variety, actually.

1076
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:39,499
You have information,
why aren't you coming forward?

1077
01:30:41,751 --> 01:30:44,675
Well, you have information too.
So what are you gonna do?

1078
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:47,679
I'm a journalist.
I'm gonna do what I always do.

1079
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:50,258
And this information's gonna be on
every computer screen in the next 20 minutes,

1080
01:30:50,259 --> 01:30:51,890
and I'm gonna find out everything
you're hiding from me,

1081
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:55,208
and I'm gonna expose it in a very big and very real way.

1082
01:30:56,663 --> 01:30:59,000
You're about to do a lot of damage
to a lot of people.

1083
01:31:00,056 --> 01:31:01,786
You've no idea how much.

1084
01:31:03,155 --> 01:31:07,501
I think they have it coming.
- On that, you could not be more wrong.

1085
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:12,392
Innocent people are about to get
swept up in this storm you're unleashing.

1086
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,053
Trust me.
- Trust you...?

1087
01:31:16,766 --> 01:31:18,105
Tell me something, Mr Osborne.

1088
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:20,501
Are you one of those innocent people?
- No, I am not.

1089
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:24,403
But my daughter is.

1090
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,307
How so?

1091
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,711
I got somethin' I need to do,

1092
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:39,855
but on my own terms.

1093
01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:04,752
Upper peninsula.

1094
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:15,930
'Becc, it's Dad.
I'm trying you again.

1095
01:32:16,534 --> 01:32:19,558
Um... sorry about the messages.

1096
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,403
uh...

1097
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:26,300
Listen, if you... when you get a chance,
I need to talk to you, to tell you...

1098
01:32:27,478 --> 01:32:30,971
this... Shepard guy, um...

1099
01:32:32,275 --> 01:32:34,760
uh, it's important, 'Becc.

1100
01:32:35,588 --> 01:32:38,996
I love you, sweetie.
Call me back, please.

1101
01:32:43,276 --> 01:32:46,283
I don't know why that's so hard to figure out.
- What makes you think I was ever gonna be...

1102
01:32:46,284 --> 01:32:48,880
For one thing, I didn't do it.
I wasn't there, Mimi.

1103
01:32:48,977 --> 01:32:51,004
But you should have been,
then everything would have been different.

1104
01:32:51,485 --> 01:32:56,494
Vince lost his cool, completely.
You wouldn't have, nobody would've gotten hurt.

1105
01:32:56,495 --> 01:33:00,981
Somebody didn't get hurt, somebody got killed.
A father, a husband, with a family.

1106
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:04,333
You think I didn't think about that when
so many fathers with families were being killed?

1107
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:05,475
And still are!

1108
01:33:05,487 --> 01:33:07,430
You shouldn't have gone, Mimi.
You should've said no.

1109
01:33:09,974 --> 01:33:11,714
We were done.
- No. You were done.

1110
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:15,540
I never was, but you couldn't accept that.
- Mimi...

1111
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:19,327
You fooled yourself into thinking
I was someone else.

1112
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:21,435
And you're still doing it.

1113
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,187
I am not the one fooling myself, it was over!
-  It wasn't... over.

1114
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,199
It's still not over.

1115
01:33:29,584 --> 01:33:31,587
Every single thing we said
then, is true today.

1116
01:33:31,685 --> 01:33:34,704
And every single day, it's getting worse.
- That's not the point.

1117
01:33:34,737 --> 01:33:36,977
Oh, it's exactly the point, Nick!

1118
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:41,448
I won't give myself up
to a system I despise.

1119
01:33:42,314 --> 01:33:45,674
I won't give up my freedom and accept
their version of what life is supposed to be.

1120
01:33:45,674 --> 01:33:49,513
Mimi, how free are you? Really?
- Well, I'm not in jail.

1121
01:33:50,494 --> 01:33:53,314
I don't expect you to understand.
They have you.

1122
01:33:53,315 --> 01:33:54,275
Oh, like hell.

1123
01:33:54,322 --> 01:33:58,902
A system that protects the super-rich,
and the super, super, super-rich,

1124
01:33:58,903 --> 01:34:02,902
And fucks over everyone else, and the planet to boot.
- Mimi... Mimi, would you just stop?

1125
01:34:03,574 --> 01:34:08,494
Everyone who's given up and given in,
they're living at the expense of what they once believed.

1126
01:34:08,495 --> 01:34:12,311
It's so sad!
You understood this,

1127
01:34:12,888 --> 01:34:15,712
I'm sorry you've forgotten.
- I wish I had forgotten!

1128
01:34:16,096 --> 01:34:18,323
Because my problem is
I can't stop remembering.

1129
01:34:18,516 --> 01:34:22,495
So if you've built a wall so high, more power
to you, you're stronger than I am.

1130
01:34:22,506 --> 01:34:24,108
I'm will turn myself in...

1131
01:34:24,888 --> 01:34:29,796
the day the politicians and corporations
turn themselves in for all they've done.

1132
01:34:30,085 --> 01:34:32,948
That's the day I'll hand myself in.
Scout's fuckin' honor.

1133
01:34:33,045 --> 01:34:36,021
Stop hiding behind your fucking revolutionary rant.
- Oh, don't turn it on me.

1134
01:34:36,117 --> 01:34:37,514
You know what I see?

1135
01:34:37,998 --> 01:34:41,241
I see the same person.
I see it, kid.

1136
01:34:42,498 --> 01:34:44,498
I see it in your eyes.

1137
01:34:46,295 --> 01:34:50,327
You can hide from everyone else in the world,
and be somebody else, but not with me.

1138
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:54,503
What are your memories, Mi?
The ones you can't run away from.

1139
01:34:54,696 --> 01:34:55,656
Hey!

1140
01:34:58,274 --> 01:35:00,512
We had a responsibility beyond the cause.

1141
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,610
We had a baby.

1142
01:35:07,704 --> 01:35:10,645
We were so consumed by our principles,

1143
01:35:11,996 --> 01:35:14,633
that we abandoned our most
fundamental duty.

1144
01:35:19,777 --> 01:35:21,817
We were doing our duty, Nick.

1145
01:35:22,877 --> 01:35:26,077
We made a plan, that if anything ever went wrong,
- Never should have carried out that plan.

1146
01:35:26,077 --> 01:35:28,315
we would know exactly
what we had to do.

1147
01:35:28,698 --> 01:35:30,718
We both agreed.
- We were wrong.

1148
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:34,130
We had no choice.
- We should have known that we were wrong.

1149
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:38,711
We both accepted it,

1150
01:35:39,991 --> 01:35:41,440
and we both had to live with it.

1151
01:36:22,297 --> 01:36:23,542
It wasn't a dream...

1152
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:31,702
it was a possibility,
we could have made a reality.

1153
01:36:32,599 --> 01:36:36,379
We could make them stop.

1154
01:36:37,204 --> 01:36:40,180
Yeah, we could change things,

1155
01:36:41,092 --> 01:36:42,540
if we could make a difference.

1156
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:46,288
I still believe in that possibility.

1157
01:36:59,585 --> 01:37:01,442
Is that all you believe?

1158
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,726
Can you put me through to
Ben Shepard please?

1159
01:37:14,686 --> 01:37:17,374
(Aw, shit!)
Rebecca!

1160
01:37:18,047 --> 01:37:20,531
What did you say to my dad?
He sounds really upset.

1161
01:37:21,407 --> 01:37:24,106
What do you mean?
- He left me a dozen voice messages last night,

1162
01:37:24,107 --> 01:37:25,355
he said it had to do with you.

1163
01:37:26,411 --> 01:37:31,016
What is going on?
- You're gonna have to talk to your father.

1164
01:37:44,309 --> 01:37:45,641
You're up.

1165
01:37:47,809 --> 01:37:52,153
I remember when these trees were so small,
you could see clear across the water.

1166
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:59,139
I saw her.

1167
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:03,231
What?

1168
01:38:07,812 --> 01:38:10,535
I've went to do Ann Arbor on my way...

1169
01:38:11,611 --> 01:38:14,334
I didn't want to.
I just...

1170
01:38:14,632 --> 01:38:17,228
couldn't help myself.

1171
01:38:20,212 --> 01:38:24,641
I sat in my car like
some kind of stalker.

1172
01:38:25,986 --> 01:38:27,233
Mim.

1173
01:38:32,113 --> 01:38:34,829
She's really something, Nicky.

1174
01:38:36,817 --> 01:38:38,230
Truly.

1175
01:38:43,614 --> 01:38:45,634
We always intended to
tell you the truth.

1176
01:38:46,017 --> 01:38:47,722
You always intended...?

1177
01:38:49,806 --> 01:38:53,670
At the time we felt...
- We hoped that nobody needed to know.

1178
01:38:56,111 --> 01:38:58,459
I never asked about my birth parents,

1179
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,319
I really never needed to know.

1180
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:05,435
We know. There's no way
to make this easier.

1181
01:39:06,012 --> 01:39:08,922
We redid your identity,
papered a legal adoption.

1182
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:10,553
None of that matters to me.

1183
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,553
Did you think I
couldn't handle it?

1184
01:39:15,225 --> 01:39:17,144
Sweetie, we gotta talk through this.

1185
01:39:21,613 --> 01:39:23,517
No one's perfect, 'Becc.

1186
01:39:25,213 --> 01:39:27,025
I love you

1187
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:32,522
I love you too.

1188
01:39:56,816 --> 01:39:58,576
I can't do what you
want me to do, Nicky.

1189
01:40:00,015 --> 01:40:01,028
I know.

1190
01:40:03,112 --> 01:40:06,464
I guess I was hoping you would
become the person who could.

1191
01:40:11,117 --> 01:40:12,533
So it goes.

1192
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:38,542
Sir, the local K-9 units are on the way.
- Roger that.

1193
01:40:43,724 --> 01:40:45,034
Hello?

1194
01:40:48,219 --> 01:40:49,648
I'm here alone!

1195
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,232
Hello?

1196
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,572
You?!

1197
01:40:57,628 --> 01:40:59,153
You expecting to see somebody else?

1198
01:41:01,825 --> 01:41:04,428
She here?
- Who're we talking about?

1199
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:08,168
Who're we talkin' about. Mimi Lurie!
That's who you came to see, right?

1200
01:41:08,457 --> 01:41:11,350
Huh?
- Mimi Lurie. That's who you came to see, correct?

1201
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:13,175
Why would I do that?
- She could testify that you weren't at the bank.

1202
01:41:13,366 --> 01:41:15,546
Almost sounds like a news story, doesn't it?

1203
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:20,246
Unfortunately, I need a source.
- Really? Must be a new policy.

1204
01:41:21,022 --> 01:41:22,239
Is she here, Nick?

1205
01:41:23,023 --> 01:41:24,254
She never was.

1206
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:30,723
You call 'em?
- No.

1207
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:39,244
Well you got yourself a story, kid. Congratulations.
I hope you're satisfied.

1208
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:42,434
I don't wanna see a guy go to jail for the
rest of his life for something he didn't do.

1209
01:41:42,628 --> 01:41:46,141
Is that what passes for idealism these days?
- Is Mimi gonna surrender?

1210
01:41:47,028 --> 01:41:49,532
No.
- No. So, where are you going?

1211
01:41:49,724 --> 01:41:52,332
Well, before she can not surrender,
she has to first not get caught.

1212
01:41:52,525 --> 01:41:53,958
I don't understand, there
was an easier way.

1213
01:41:54,633 --> 01:41:55,845
Usually is.

1214
01:41:56,925 --> 01:41:58,854
You'll learn that lesson.

1215
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:00,953
You know, I met your daughter.

1216
01:42:04,826 --> 01:42:06,434
Your older daughter.

1217
01:42:08,534 --> 01:42:11,535
Then you really do have yourself a story, don't ya'?

1218
01:42:11,922 --> 01:42:14,299
I'm guessing you didn't just stumble into this information...

1219
01:42:14,492 --> 01:42:15,740
by my count, there are exactly

1220
01:42:16,128 --> 01:42:17,907
four people on the planet that...

1221
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,251
knew about this...

1222
01:42:21,627 --> 01:42:26,255
You get let in on something like this, Ben...
you get answers, but not the ones you think.

1223
01:42:26,736 --> 01:42:28,172
Secrets are a dangerous thing, Ben.

1224
01:42:29,229 --> 01:42:31,761
We all think we want to know them,
but if you've kept one to yourself...

1225
01:42:32,336 --> 01:42:35,775
You come to understand that doing so means that
you may learn something about somebody else,

1226
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,170
but you also discover something about yourself.

1227
01:42:40,332 --> 01:42:41,661
I hope you're ready for that.

1228
01:42:43,009 --> 01:42:45,353
At this point,
I have no more secrets.

1229
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,166
You're a smart guy...

1230
01:42:49,029 --> 01:42:50,350
Hold on, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1231
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,942
You know exactly what motivates me,
and has for the last thirty years.

1232
01:42:54,038 --> 01:42:56,641
What you're gonna have to
figure out, is what motivates you.

1233
01:42:57,026 --> 01:43:00,234
I hope you like the answer.
- Hold on. Nick. Nick!

1234
01:43:00,234 --> 01:43:03,903
When the FBI comes, they'll follow me.
They'll never know she was here.

1235
01:43:18,236 --> 01:43:19,449
There he is.

1236
01:44:25,441 --> 01:44:29,714
What's that? That's it.
Come on! Come on.

1237
01:44:33,614 --> 01:44:38,155
Alright... we'll take up, you guys flank around from there.

1238
01:45:20,141 --> 01:45:20,893
There he is!

1239
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:28,258
Nicholas Sloan!

1240
01:45:29,647 --> 01:45:35,232
You're under arrest for the
murder of Hugh Kroessna.

1241
01:45:44,044 --> 01:45:46,060
Can't say I'm happy to see you.

1242
01:47:19,335 --> 01:47:23,279
Mimi Lurie, last remaining fugitive
from the 1980 Bank of Michigan robbery,

1243
01:47:23,376 --> 01:47:26,635
surrendered herself to authorities today
near Drummond Island, Michigan,

1244
01:47:26,732 --> 01:47:28,555
just across the water from Canada.

1245
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:32,567
She confessed to her role in the robbery, which
resulted in the death of a guard.

1246
01:47:32,856 --> 01:47:35,073
Charges have been dropped against Nicholas Sloan,

1247
01:47:35,265 --> 01:47:38,067
long thought to be a co-conspirator
in the robbery.

1248
01:47:38,165 --> 01:47:43,441
No comment yet from Sloan, who is expected
to be released from custody as early as tomorrow.

1249
01:47:43,538 --> 01:47:44,594
In other news today...

1250
01:48:44,062 --> 01:48:46,639
I have nothing to say.
