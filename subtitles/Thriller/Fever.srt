1
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,518
It's sad

2
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:38,768
..your real story; your life -
shouldn't have ended this way..

3
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,143
Maybe this is the difference between
real life and a story..

4
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,185
Fact and fiction..

5
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:00,185
That you cannot control your life..

6
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:07,222
..and generally the end is not
always what one wants it to be..

7
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,102
But how did it all happen?

8
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,018
<i>They say, life can change in a moment!</i>

9
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,977
<i>I did not know that one accident
will change my life like this!</i>

10
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,060
Armin..
Where are you?

11
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,768
Armin?

12
00:09:53,393 --> 00:10:03,977
<i># Once upon a time..
Someone was so lost in me..#</i>

13
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:09,393
<i># Was in every breath..#</i>

14
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:15,643
<i># But still was not mine..#</i>

15
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:34,435
<i># In the time that has stopped..#</i>

16
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:41,393
<i># Life moves in such a way..#</i>

17
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:52,935
<i># That happiness also
meets me like a stranger..#</i>

18
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,430
<i>Around 10 days ago...</i>

19
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,435
<i>When I got down from
the bus to go to Champery.. </i>

20
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,977
<i>That was the beginning.</i>

21
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,518
Hello stranger!

22
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,602
Surprise, surprise.

23
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,477
What are you doing here?

24
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:52,935
Where are you going?

25
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:54,935
Champery..

26
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,268
Let me drop you.

27
00:11:58,227 --> 00:11:59,295
Come on..

28
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:39,935
Pooja, drive slowly!

29
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,766
Can you please drive slowly!

30
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:21,935
What happened David?

31
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,109
Who got him here?

32
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,977
He was found on the roadside..

33
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:26,727
Unconscious!

34
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:30,685
Surprisingly Fredrick,
no broken bones!

35
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,185
Can you hear me?

36
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:34,977
How are you feeling?

37
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,227
What's your name?

38
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,602
What happened?

39
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,643
Are you Indian?

40
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:45,352
What happened?

41
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,268
Maybe it's a hit and run!

42
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:52,060
<i>When I regained consciousness in the
hospital, I did not remember anything!</i>

43
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,185
Did you see the vehicle?

44
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:56,977
How did it happen?

45
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,268
<i>I had forgotten everything..</i>

46
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,310
Where are you from?

47
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,560
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

48
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,143
<i>What happened to you?</i>

49
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,393
What do you want?

50
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,685
Do I know you?

51
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,518
<i>I kept on thinking about
the girl throughout the night..</i>

52
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,768
<i>..but I could not find any answers..</i>

53
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:24,018
<i>The only thing that came
back to me was my name - Armin!</i>

54
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,259
<i>..and that I lived in Paris.</i>

55
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,810
<i>Along with this I also got a
feeling that I had committed a crime..</i>

56
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,685
<i>Which crime, I had no idea!</i>

57
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,352
<i>Just so that the doctor and the police
would not be suspicious..</i>

58
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,810
<i>I told them what they expected to hear!</i>
- You wont remember me..

59
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:42,893
..my name is
Dr. David Roy.

60
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,977
Armin, Armin Salem!

61
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:50,268
Thank you, Irina.
- Okay.

62
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:54,435
Looks as if you did not fall properly.

63
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,352
Or else you would have at least a
few broken bones.

64
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,852
You are very unlucky,
just cuts and bruises.

65
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,227
So, how are you feeling?

66
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:05,977
Like a patient in a hospital.

67
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,643
Doctor, how long have I been here?

68
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:10,268
Its been four days..

69
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,102
Four days!

70
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,185
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury..

71
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:19,060
It usually happens after an accident.
So, where are you from?

72
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,435
France, Paris.

73
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:25,602
Doctor, who got me here?

74
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,518
A chauffeur.. a cabbie found you..
somewhere near a church..

75
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,810
Did he find any luggage?

76
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,810
Only the watch could save itself.

77
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:43,268
I think.. I think I will be
able to discharge you.

78
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,643
Would you like to inform Rhea?

79
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:50,018
You were mumbling her name
when you were delirious.

80
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:51,977
<i>I love you.. </i>

81
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:53,812
<i>I don't want to hurt you.. </i>

82
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,977
That is what I wanted to ask you..

83
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,893
<i>Can I make a call?</i>

84
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,477
<i>Yeah, sure!</i>

85
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,685
<i>Hello.. Hello..</i>

86
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:20,518
Hi! Its me, Armin.

87
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,977
<i>Armin who?</i>

88
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:25,935
No, I am fine!

89
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,518
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

90
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:28,518
Had a little accident!

91
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,643
<i>Accident! Who the f*** is this?</i>

92
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:31,852
No-no I am fine!

93
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,477
<i>You've got a wrong number!</i>

94
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,810
Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

95
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:38,935
See how soon you can do it!

96
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,727
I will wait for you in Champery.

97
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,352
Love you. Bye!

98
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,810
You wanted to see me?

99
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,268
<i>Yes doctor.</i>

100
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,018
<i>Your friend must be
relieved to hear from you?</i>

101
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:09,935
Quite.

102
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:12,935
When is she coming?

103
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:16,477
She will take 2-3 days..

104
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:19,768
<i>Maybe more!</i>

105
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,560
Where were you going
before the accident?

106
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,643
<i>Train station, and then to catch a
flight from Zurich.</i>

107
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:32,977
That means you have lost your
passport, tickets- everything!

108
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:37,685
What will you do now?

109
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:40,893
<i>That's what I am thinking!</i>

110
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:43,852
<i>Isn't there anyone else who
can help you?</i>

111
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>I don't know anyone here.</i>

112
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,352
<i>If I help you, hope you won't run
away with my money!</i>

113
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,435
I would need a passport for that too!

114
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,102
<i>Okay! I'll see what I can do!</i>

115
00:19:57,393 --> 00:20:00,893
<i>My lie forced the doctor to help me.</i>

116
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:42,518
What do you want?
Why are you following me?

117
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:44,685
Excuse me?

118
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:47,227
If you can't understand English,
I am sure you can understand Hindi.

119
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,518
Why are you following me?

120
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,477
I don't even know you!
Why should I follow you?

121
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,143
You had even come to the hospital?

122
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,602
I am sure there is some confusion!

123
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,935
I am not getting confused.
What were you doing outside my room?

124
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,935
Outside your room?
Oh! You mean the hotel! I stay there!

125
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,768
My God! You are really paranoid!

126
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,643
Oh! Now you are even
staying in my hotel!

127
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:16,768
Just tell me the truth!
Who has sent you to follow me?

128
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:18,855
I want an answer!

129
00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:22,018
Now you stop following me, or
I will call the cops.

130
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,018
You understand that!

131
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:42,593
Hi.. Would you like some bread?
- Thank you.

132
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:49,278
<i>Keys!
Excuse me!</i>

133
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:57,278
Bonjour!

134
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,612
Bonjour!

135
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,973
Nice Monroe!

136
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:24,612
Thanks.

137
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,028
Kaavya Chaudhary.

138
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:37,278
Pooja.

139
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,737
Doesn't seem so from my face, isnt it?
And that's Jean Pierre.

140
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:41,987
Hi!

141
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:09,778
I work at the Bern Museum
as a curator. Were you in Bern?

142
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,320
No? Not already...

143
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:12,528
I can't believe it!

144
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,112
<i>House-keeping please.</i>

145
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:33,862
House-keeping.

146
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:36,862
Later please.

147
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,903
Here you go. You call me,
I will be there for you..

148
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:44,143
<i>..I can pick you up.
Isn't it, Jean Pierre?</i>

149
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:44,820
<i>Sure.</i>

150
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:26,695
It's okay, it's okay!
He will be fine!

151
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,237
Move, move.

152
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,445
Are you okay?
- He is fine?

153
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,153
He is fine?
- He is fine.

154
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:55,278
Okay! Just calm down please,
We can go.

155
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:56,403
Come on, leave them alone.

156
00:27:58,903 --> 00:27:59,987
You okay?

157
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:13,487
If you don't know how to swim..
You should keep away from water!

158
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,695
I wasn't trying to swim,
my leg slipped.

159
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:16,862
Whatever.

160
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,403
<i>Do I know you?</i>

161
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,195
I don't know.

162
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,028
What is your name?

163
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:28,112
Are you asking me or scolding me?

164
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,528
Kaavya Chaudhary.

00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:33,778
Won't you tell me your name?

166
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,195
What do you do?

167
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,528
What do you do, apart from drowning!

168
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,528
Question for a question
is not an answer!

169
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:51,112
I work at the Bern Museum. But why
do you want to know so much about me?

170
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:53,487
Hope it isn't that..
- You had come to the hospital, right?

171
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,070
What?

172
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,737
Actually I am in the habit of lying..

173
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:04,195
But I am not in the mood today!
I wasn't there!

174
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,237
And, stay away!

175
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:40,070
<i>Kaavya Chaudhary was
who she was claiming to be..</i>

176
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:44,612
<i>..but whom had I met in the hospital..</i>

177
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:09,695
Armin.

178
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:27,028
<i>I tired to look for Armin Salem on
the net.. Google, Facebook, Linked in..</i>

179
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:31,112
<i>There were many Armin Salem..
but they were not me!</i>

180
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:36,903
<i>I even tried to remember
my email address.. </i>

181
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,612
<i>But nothing!</i>

182
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:51,185
<i>Either I never existed on the internet or
else I was trying to find a wrong man?</i>

183
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,362
<i>Who was I?</i>

184
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,195
<i>And who were they?</i>

185
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:07,153
<i>If there was an answer,
it had to be in this.</i>

186
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:12,862
<i>Kaavya...</i>

187
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,195
<i>Dr. Roy...</i>

188
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:15,445

<i>Champery...</i>

190
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,820
Only the watch has
been able to save itself!

191
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,862
<i>WK</i>

192
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,320
<i>WK</i>

193
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,195
<i>Hello! Good evening.
How are you?</i>

194
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:36,820
<i>I am fine, sir.
Good evening.</i>

195
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,487
<i>How can I help you?</i>

196
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,487
You look very familiar, have
we met before?

197
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,987
Don't think so. No, cannot remember.

198
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,362
Aah, Sorry..

199
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:46,695
This is the only place where you
make these watches, right?

200
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:47,987
Absolutely!

201
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:52,445
I am sure then you can tell me whether
this is an original piece or not!?

202
00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:53,695
Let's have a look.

203
00:32:56,303 --> 00:33:00,903
If the watch is not sold here
it is definitely a fake.

204
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:04,677
But I will have a look in my book.
One sec, I will have a look.

205
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:06,028
Thank you!

206
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:20,487
Hello, yeah.. this is
Pooja Warrier calling..

207
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,320
<i>Are you home?</i>

208
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:29,070
Sir, it's ours.. it's a real one..
from us!

209
00:33:29,862 --> 00:33:30,862
Thank God!

210
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:33,070
Thank you so much sir..

211
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,112
Pleasure.

212
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,487
And this was billed in the name of..?

213
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:41,248
Warriers.

214
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,195
Warriers!
- Staffelstrasse 56.

215
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:26,445
Yes please.. what do you want?

216
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,320
Hi.

217
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:28,112
Yes..

218
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,862
Warrier?

219
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,362
Sorry? Who you looking for?

220
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,528
Does Warrier stay here?

221
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,653
Does he stay here?

222
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,778
Used to.. But not anymore.

223
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,612
Used to.. Dead!

224
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,653
Dead? When.. how..?

225
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,320
I don't know.. used to.. dead!

226
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,028
But is there something about..

227
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:56,445
I told you he is dead..
please go.. go..

228
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:11,487
Oh my God! Thank you..
thank.. thank you so much..

229
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,237
..there was just this
guy who was just following me..

230
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:35,820
<i>My identity was still
as unknown as the night..</i>

231
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:41,737
<i>Warrior was dead
and so were my clues..</i>

232
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:47,693
<i>Who was this Warrior
whose watch was with me?</i>

233
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:49,903
Used to. Dead!

234
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:51,300
Dead?

235
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:52,925
<i>Who had killed him?</i>

236
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:54,258
<i>Or he himself had..</i>

237
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:57,761
<i>Questions whose answers
were in my head..</i>

238
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:01,300
<i>So I turned back the pages
of my life.. And tried to remember..</i>

239
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:04,341
<i>Every moment after coming
out of the hospital..</i>

240
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:08,508
<i>And suddenly from behind the voice,
a face appeared..</i>

241
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:15,133
<i>The number I had called randomly from
the hospital was not random at all...</i>

242
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,383
<i>But was Fabian's.. </i>

243
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,508
<i>Fabian Schneider.
The guy who made fake passports..</i>

244
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:30,091
<i>My first instinct in the
hospital was to get away from there.</i>

245
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:31,841
<i>And that is why.. </i>

246
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,550
<i>Now all the answers were in Paris..</i>

247
00:36:37,383 --> 00:36:41,341
<i>Hello! Hello!
- Hello!</i>

248
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:42,800
Fabian?

249
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,008
Yes?

250
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:46,008
<i>Who is this?</i>
- Armin Salem..

251
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:49,258
<i>Do you know me.. remember me?</i>

252
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,716
Should I?

253
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:53,508
<i>What do you want?</i>

254
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,008
I want a passport.

255
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,383
Go to the embassy..

256
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:59,300
<i>How much?</i>

257
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,133
You should know!

258
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,216
<i>When?</i>

259
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:09,341
<i>Come on.. </i>

260
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:11,925
Come on Tuesday.

261
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:17,883
<i>Now Paris and my identity
was just 2 days away.</i>

262
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:19,883
<i>Only 2 days!</i>

263
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,466
Hi!

264
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:12,758
I thought you had
asked me to say away.

265
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,591
Do you always listen
to everything that people say?

266
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:22,383
I had asked you, not myself..

267
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:32,633
Sorry.. I don't always behave like
this.. But that day you were too..

268
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,841
So.. would you like
to tell me the truth now.

269
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,508
Will you be able to hear it?

270
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:42,508
I have already told you.

271
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,633
What are you looking at?

272
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
There is lots to see!

273
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:56,675
Really!

274
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:00,883
So, am I looking good or bad?

275
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,716
Bad!

276
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:09,716
Won't you at least tell me your name?

277
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:13,300
Okay.. at least tell me about the
wound on your face..

278
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,425
Accident!

279
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:24,175
Armin Salem.. from France.. on a
vacation.. happy?

280
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:25,723
Accident.. how?

281
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,383
Hit and run!

282
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,550
Life is a hit and run I guess..

283
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:38,466
People meet you accidentally and then
vanish..

284
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,175
The only difference is that the
wounds cannot be seen on the face..

285
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:55,758
Seems as if you have been through an
accident yourself..

286
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:57,966
Is it so evident?

287
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,300
No-no.. have been saved
from one until now..

288
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:06,216
Lucky you..

289
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:10,550
Right..
Or maybe.. unlucky me!

290
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:40,805
<i>Karan..</i>

291
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,305
<i>Karan..</i>

292
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,055
What happened Armin?

293
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,222
All okay?

294
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:31,343
I thought Rhea.. I mean there was
someone there..

295
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:32,722
Who?

296
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:34,430
I don't know..

297
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:35,763
Maybe someone..

298
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:43,555
Surprising, so many people.. Seems
as if they don't get out of the pub..

299
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,638
Single malt please..
on the rocks. And you?

300
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,305
We will have a Glenlivet.

301
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:52,638
Nice?

302
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,305
Cheers!
- Cheers!

303
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,763
I will just be back..

<i># It is your faithfullness. #</i>

325
00:44:46,388 --> 00:44:51,930
<i># And that is why I am alive. #</i>

326
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,972
<i># I'm enriched because of your love. #</i>

327
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:00,720
<i># I have stolen you. #</i>

328
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,388
<i># From destiny itself. #</i>

329
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,888
<i>Karan..</i>

330
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:44,263
<i>Karan..</i>

331
00:47:00,055 --> 00:47:01,972
This means... that I have gone mad?

332
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:06,972
Not until now..
but don't know if you were before!

333
00:47:11,347 --> 00:47:13,513
You know it takes time
to recover from a brain injury.

334
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:19,847
So you think every thing I have seen
so far is an hallucination.

335
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:21,597
I don't believe this..

336
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:24,055
Nothing was for real?

337
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,722
I told you that I had seen
that girl alive on the street..

338
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,138
But you also said that, you have seen
her dead in your room!

339
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:38,305
What do you mean?

340
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,805
Either you are a very good actor
or you have done something...

341
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,680
What?

342
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:58,222
If you are seeing the girl again
and again, it means only one thing...

343
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:01,138
And I hope I am not right!

344
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,597
You want to say that..

345
00:48:04,555 --> 00:48:06,013
..I killed the girl?

346
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:09,347
But you are forgetting that, you were
the one who told me that...

347
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,722
..hallucination has no logic!

348
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:12,972
So!?

349
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:16,472
I never said that.

350
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:22,263
Either you've actually
come from Paris...

351
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,388
Or I have helped a wrong man!

352
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:36,055
How much?

353
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:40,722
Thanks.

354
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:48,305
<i>The moment I reached
Sion I remembered that..</i>

355
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:51,472
<i>..I had taken a fake
passport from Fabian..</i>

356
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:56,722
<i>I was sure that Fabian
would know something about me.</i>

357
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:46,347
Taxi..

358
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,388
<i>Hi! Can I come inside?</i>

359
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:04,805
I wanted to ask you something?

360
00:51:06,972 --> 00:51:09,097
Is your life in danger?

361
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:10,222
I...
- Why?

362
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:15,388
Whenever I meet you,
I feel as if you are..

363
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,347
What do you want from me?

364
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:18,805
What do you want?

365
00:51:18,972 --> 00:51:22,097
If I don't say anything it does
not mean that.. I don't know anything.

366
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,472
First pretending to be in love..

367
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:26,055
And then turning around to say,
'I don't know you'.

368
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:28,930
Please get out of here. Out!

369
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:33,472
Damn it!

370
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:44,513
I am really sorry..

371
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:49,513
..but what I don't understand is, why do
you want to meet me again and again?

372
00:51:50,513 --> 00:51:55,430
I.. I don't want
anything from you Armin..

373
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:02,013
Just that whenever I meet you,
you look so troubled..

374
00:52:02,193 --> 00:52:07,513
But if you don't like it, I can leave?

375
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:09,597
I said I am sorry Kaavya!

376
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,263
It's just that.. my mind is so..

377
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:18,055
It's all so.. I can't ..can't explain!

378
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,305
What is the matter Armin?

379
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:30,093
You.. you can trust me!
Tell me please..

380
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,305
You really want to hear it.?

381
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:44,555
When I regained consciousness
in the hospital..

382
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,638
The only thing that came
back to me was my name, Armin..

383
00:52:49,138 --> 00:52:50,638
And that I am from Paris..

384
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:55,430
But I didn't remember what I do..
and what am I doing here?

385
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:57,805
Nothing!

386
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:01,055
But more importantly..

387
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,722
I woke up with the guilt..
.. of having committed a crime.

388
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:13,722
Crime? Which crime?

389
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:19,930
I don't know.. I don't remember a thing.
To know this I wanted to go to Paris.

390
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,388
I would also have got the passport..

391
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:29,013
..if someone hadn't informed the cops!

392
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:32,513
That is why you have been behaving so
suspiciously..

393
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:35,347
Now I have even started
seeing weird things.

394
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:38,888
Do you remember the
girl I had seen on the road?

395
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:42,456
I saw her in the shower! Dead!

396
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,013
And you were also there!

397
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:48,013
I ?

398
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,222
And then both of you vanished.

399
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:58,097
I.. I just don't
know what is happening.

400
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:03,180
It will be better for you,
Kaavya, if you stay away from me.

401
00:54:03,638 --> 00:54:09,472
Look, I am certain that when
you remember what Armin has done..

402
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,763
.. it won't be bad..

403
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,930
And don't they say.. 'Eyes don't lie!'

404
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,555
I trust my eyes completely!

405
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:38,097
Everything will be fine, Armin.
I promise!

406
00:54:38,348 --> 00:54:41,347
<i># Your memory..# </i>

407
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,013
<i># Your memory..# </i>

408
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:30,222
Hi!

409
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,847
Who are you?
Why are you after me?

410
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,097
And you are alive?

411
00:55:39,638 --> 00:55:42,263
But.. all that blood!

412
00:55:42,347 --> 00:55:45,263
Of course I am alive..
What do you think?

413
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:46,638
Am I a ghost!?

414
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,013
You know Hindi?
- Don't you remember?

415
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,097
I told you, I am a linguist !

416
00:55:52,013 --> 00:55:55,430
You are talking to me as if you
don't know me!

417
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:57,597
I know you?

418
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:00,347
Karan, what's wrong with you?

419
00:56:00,555 --> 00:56:01,272
Karan?

420
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:07,847
Not Karan, my name is Armin.

421
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:10,888
But you told me it was Karan!

422
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:13,930
When did I tell you? I have never
met you before!

423
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,055
Of course you are Karan!

424
00:56:16,597 --> 00:56:18,222
How do you know me?

425
00:56:18,472 --> 00:56:19,638
Why are you doing this?

426
00:56:19,722 --> 00:56:21,138
Didn't you hear me?

427
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:23,222
Just.. just calm down..

428
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:26,222
We had met on the
bus a few months ago.

429
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:28,513
On the bus to Bern.

430
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:29,555
And..

431
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:33,055
Nothing.. We spoke about a few things.

432
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,305
What things?

433
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:39,847
That you stay in Bern..
.. You are a writer..

434
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:41,930
.. Karan..

435
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:45,805
Karan.. what?

436
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:48,472
I.. I can't remember!

437
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,430
You are lying.. I am seeing you
again and again..

438
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:54,597
.. What do you want from me..

439
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,472
.. and what are you doing in my room?

440
00:56:58,138 --> 00:57:00,888
I was waiting for a cab,
when I saw you!

441
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:03,111
I was surprised to see you..

442
00:57:03,347 --> 00:57:04,347
Karan..?

443
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:08,055
Karan..?

444
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,722
<i>I called out to you but.. but
you ran as if you had seen a ghost!</i>

445
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:13,430
Why're you running away.

446
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,638
<i>I came after you..
concerned, is everything fine?</i>

447
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:19,680
The door was open, so I walked in!

448
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:21,555
What is your name?

449
00:57:21,923 --> 00:57:22,847
Rhea..

450
00:57:24,097 --> 00:57:25,597
Do you want to inform Rhea?

451
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:28,847
The doctor has sent you, hasn't he?

452
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:33,888
No one has sent me.
Why are you doing this?

453
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,347
You stay around here somewhere?

454
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:42,305
Of course!

455
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:44,555
Come, I will drop you home!

456
00:57:44,888 --> 00:57:45,930
I can go on my own.

457
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:50,097
I know you can.
I said I will drop you!

458
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:52,597
If you insist!

459
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:09,222
Wish you would tell me what's wrong!

460
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:14,972
What are you trying to prove?
I really don't understand!

461
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:17,097
So, you stay here?

462
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:18,430
Yes.

463
00:58:20,136 --> 00:58:21,597
What are you looking for?

464
00:58:26,013 --> 00:58:27,472
And you met me on the bus?

465
00:58:27,555 --> 00:58:29,737
Yes.
Don't you remember?

466
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:33,388
Look Karan..

467
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:36,055
Not Karan! Armin!

468
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:42,680
Okay..
Look, we had a great rapport..

469
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:45,055
..that is why I want to help you..

470
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,555
..but if you don't
tell me what happened..

471
00:58:47,972 --> 00:58:49,138
.. how can I help you?

472
00:58:49,347 --> 00:58:53,222
Are you listening?
Karan...? Armin..?

473
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:00,138
Alright! If you don't want to..

474
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:07,472
Rhea!

475
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,097
Rhea?

476
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,138
<i>Do you want to break the door?</i>

477
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,763
That's how badly you want to meet me!

478
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:24,222
Where were you?

479
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:26,222
I was following you!

480
00:59:27,972 --> 00:59:30,809
Do I have to ask you now,
where all I can go?

481
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:34,347
What is it?

482
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,888
You want to tell me something?

483
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:36,763
Sit.

484
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:46,720
I can't decide whom
to trust and whom not to!

485
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,972
Do you remember the girl I had seen
dead in the shower?

486
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:55,930
Yes.

487
00:59:57,305 --> 00:59:59,222
Today she came to meet me in my room!

488
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,680
What?

489
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:03,763
That means she is alive?

490
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,930
It's good in a way. At least it clears
your confusion!

491
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,597
Not really!

492
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:12,430
Why?

493
01:00:15,055 --> 01:00:19,847
Because she told me my name is
not Armin but Karan!

494
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:21,847
Why is she lying?

495
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,513
I am sure,
they are all ganging up to trap you!

496
01:00:30,763 --> 01:00:35,555
Or what if, they all are confusing you
with someone else..

497
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,472
..who looks exactly like you.

498
01:00:43,496 --> 01:00:44,930
But I am Armin!

499
01:00:48,597 --> 01:00:49,888
Or.. am I Karan?

500
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:54,430
Armin...?

501
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:00,528
Or Karan...?

502
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:50,888
I know who I am!

503
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:07,734
Who are you?

504
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:19,318
I didn't believe what she told me,
and I was right..

505
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,651
I am Armin..

506
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:24,984
Not Karan!

507

a professional assassin..</i>

508
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:51,629

509
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:56,062

548
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:24,943
Hi.
- Morning.

549
01:08:25,026 --> 01:08:25,902
Hi!

550
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:27,526
Hello Mr. Fournier

551
01:08:30,776 --> 01:08:33,318
Thank you for banking with us.
Thank you.

552
01:08:34,253 --> 01:08:36,776
<i>This time my contract was a banker..</i>

553
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:41,109
<i>A banker named Rhea.. Rhea Wagner.</i>

554
01:09:00,184 --> 01:09:02,753
<i>For me beauty is
an everyday experience..</i>

555
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:05,359
<i>..and beautiful girls
almost a daily affair..</i>

556
01:09:08,526 --> 01:09:10,609
<i>But that day there
was feeling in the air.</i>

557
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:11,526
Hi!

558
01:09:12,568 --> 01:09:17,734
<i>Life had a different intention!</i>

559
01:09:19,818 --> 01:09:22,609
<i>For the first time I
did not want to kill any one..</i>

560
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:25,026
<i>..rather, I wanted to live myself!</i>

561
01:09:25,318 --> 01:09:27,193
So, how is Michale J doing?

562
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:31,818
Could be better!

563
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:35,918
Nice to see young people around.

564
01:09:37,068 --> 01:09:38,359
Yeah, it is.

565
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:39,818
And pretty!

566
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,318
Thank you!

567
01:09:45,108 --> 01:09:46,401
Armin!

568
01:09:46,943 --> 01:09:48,484
Rhea!

569
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:53,443
Are you Indian?

570
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:55,818
Racist?

571
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:00,276
Haven't spoken Hindi in a long time.

572
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:03,943
Is that why you want to speak to me?

573
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:07,526
May I?

574
01:10:07,606 --> 01:10:08,776
Sure.

575
01:10:10,026 --> 01:10:11,776
So, how do you manage Hindi?

576
01:10:11,943 --> 01:10:14,193
My father spent a
lot of time in India..

577
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:15,943
.. I was there with him.

578
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:23,484
So where do you go, when you go?

579
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,943
Far away.

580
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:31,484
Can people come there with you?

581
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:34,734
Depends!

582
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:45,734
<i># Sour, sweet, hotter than a chilli..#</i>

583

Wait.. wait.

616
01:13:15,075 --> 01:13:18,901
Will you ever tell me, what you do?

617
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,401
Nothing!

618
01:13:22,568 --> 01:13:23,568
Truth?

619
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:24,693
Absolutely not!

620
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:26,776

Do you know.. What I do?

.. So what difference does it make?

624
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:47,859
Well, what if I am
a dangerous psychopath!?

625
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,776
If I have to die..
I would rather die by your hands!

626
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:55,734
Really?

627
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:02,526
Kill me.

628
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:03,901
Love you.

629
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:06,819
Hi!

630
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:09,193
So where does this cable-car go to?

631
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:11,234
It goes from Brienz to Hassliberg.

632
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:12,693
Yes, that's the cable-car.

633
01:14:13,018 --> 01:14:15,246
Okay, it's first.

634
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,162

What?

637
01:14:45,209 --> 01:14:46,459
What's wrong?

638

Someone wants to kill me.

Why?

642
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:24,126
I don't know.

643
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,209
We don't ask.

644
01:15:27,459 --> 01:15:28,417
We?

645
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:34,292
It's just another job for you!

646
01:15:35,334 --> 01:15:37,167
You make it sound so routine.

647
01:15:37,876 --> 01:15:39,126
You just kill!

648
01:15:40,376 --> 01:15:42,376
How many have you killed?

649
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,042
Quite a few!

650
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,209
Can mistakes be forgiven?

651
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:54,126
Can the past be
forgotten, or forgiven?

652
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,459
No Armin.

653
01:15:56,834 --> 01:16:00,751
Just because you love me, I should
forgive you?

654
01:16:01,626 --> 01:16:04,459
I am sure,
the people you have killed..

655
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,834
..they too must have loved someone.

656
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:09,459
Just like me!

657
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:16,542
No Armin, I will never forgive you!

658
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,959
<i>I really tried to explain to her..</i>

659
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:31,459
<i>But.. but she could not forgive..</i>

660
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:33,417
<i>..and I...!</i>

661
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:34,959
<i>What happened then?</i>

662
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:43,917
That is what I am trying to remember..

663
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:47,501
..but I know for sure,
something bad happened.

664
01:16:49,709 --> 01:16:53,167
What, I am not sure!

665
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:59,251
But at least you are
certain that you are Armin!

666
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:08,501
If Rhea knows me..
..then why hasn't she told me?

667
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:15,584
And why is she trying to prove
that I am not Armin? But Karan!

668
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:19,459
Unless..

669
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:21,751
Unless what?

670
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:25,292
Only she can answer that!

671
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:13,813
Hi!

672
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:16,959
Are you okay?

673
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:20,792
Enough! You can stop pretending!

674
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:23,459
I know who you are!

675
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:27,501
Come on Armin. I mean Karan!

676
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:30,167
Are you going through one
of your phases?' Why don't you sit?

677
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:33,167
I know that you are Rhea!
Right?

678
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,292
Of course I am Rhea!

679
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:41,417
You have forgotten yourself, not me!
And please, speak softly!

680
01:18:41,626 --> 01:18:43,084
Rhea wait!

681
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,459
Come outside!

682
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,626
I said wait!

683
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:52,376
Rhea wait..

684
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:54,459
.. I said wait!

685
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:55,834
Leave me alone..

686
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,626
You know that I am
Armin and not Karan.

687
01:18:58,709 --> 01:19:00,209
I remember everything!

688
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:03,042
Our meeting..
falling in love, everything!

689
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:06,417
And when you got to know
that I am a contract killer..

690
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:09,084
..what happened between us? What?

691
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:11,459
Just let me go! Please, stop!

692
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:16,001
Have you lost your mind?
We fell in love?

693
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:20,917
And you are a contract killer!
Are you trying to scare me?

694
01:19:21,626 --> 01:19:25,584
I met you once on the bus.
That's the truth!

695
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:28,542
So just stop!

696
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,417
I am Rhea!

697
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:40,167
Hi! I am Karan.

698
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:43,459
Hello!
Where are you from?

699
01:19:45,378 --> 01:19:46,379
You know Hindi?

700
01:19:46,459 --> 01:19:49,209
I am a linguist.
I also know Hindi.

701
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:50,626
Me too!

702
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:55,501
Is this what you do for a living?

703
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:59,209
I.. I have a watch
company in Champery.

704
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:01,584
It's a...

705
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:06,542
Rhea Wagner!

706
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:07,834
Wagner!
-Wagner!

707
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:10,001
Yeah!
What about you?

708
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:13,542
I.. write.
I am a writer.

709
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:14,709
Okay.

710
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:17,710
I will keep this?
- Please yeah.

711
01:20:25,469 --> 01:20:26,292
Armin.

712
01:20:27,374 --> 01:20:28,706
Rhea.

713
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:37,876
Why.. why would I lie to you?

714
01:20:41,459 --> 01:20:43,459
I had seen everything so clearly.

715
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:46,209
Damn it!

716
01:20:49,584 --> 01:20:51,417
What is the truth?
Please tell me the truth!

717
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:53,251
Just.. Just calm down.

718
01:20:53,334 --> 01:20:56,462
The more you try to remember..
.. the more it will not come back!

719
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:59,209
<i>So just let it be and
it might all come back!</i>

720
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:04,209
If you were Rhea,
you would have got me arrested!

721
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:09,751
But you are Rhea..
..and me, Armin.

722
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:13,509
Or, Karan?

723
01:21:14,126 --> 01:21:19,959
<i>You are Karan. You only told me.
In fact you sent me some emails that..</i>

724
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,542
Hi!

725
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:23,042
Hi!

726
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:26,459
You.. you both know each other?

727
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,209
- Of course not!

728
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:29,251
I am Rhea.

729
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:30,542
Kaavya.

730
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:33,584
So, this is your friend?

731
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:35,501
But she is alive!

732
01:21:35,584 --> 01:21:40,334
I thought I am Armin .. but..
..but Rhea told me that I am Karan.

733
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:44,542
But you are not Karan..

734
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:47,959
So why is she trying
to prove that you are Karan?

735
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:52,167
We met on the bus,
why would he lie to me?

736
01:21:52,751 --> 01:21:54,709
I wonder why people lie!

737
01:21:56,751 --> 01:22:01,251
Can we go Karan..
..or should I say Armin?

738
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,251
You go, I will come later.

739
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:08,292
Sure. I forgot that
you both are in love.

740
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:12,126
So you..

741
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:15,084
Cool!

742
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:19,292
She is polite!

743
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,084
You want to see the mail?

744
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:25,542
One you sent me?

745
01:22:45,185 --> 01:22:47,125
Bonjour!
- Bonjour madame! Bonjour!

746
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:49,705
I am looking for this person.
Does he stay here?

747
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,872
Yes!

748
01:22:53,163 --> 01:22:54,122
Which room?

749
01:22:54,288 --> 01:22:56,417
323. But he has gone out.

750
01:22:56,497 --> 01:22:58,747
Okay! So, can I wait here?

751
01:22:58,921 --> 01:22:59,997
Yeah sure! Please.

752
01:23:00,122 --> 01:23:01,663
Okay! Thank you!

753
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:11,113
Surprising.
You don't remember a thing?

754
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:12,071
No.

755
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,613
Why did you come to Champery then?

756
01:23:13,696 --> 01:23:15,029
That is what I am trying to find out.

757
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:18,779
For how long have
you been staying here?

758
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:21,238
Since my childhood. Why?

759
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:23,574
Have you ever been to Brienz?

760
01:23:23,654 --> 01:23:25,279
No. Never.

761
01:23:26,092 --> 01:23:27,613
Which bank do you work for?

762
01:23:28,988 --> 01:23:30,529
Who told you I work in a bank!

763
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:33,613
I have a watch company. Ancestral.

764
01:23:34,204 --> 01:23:35,613
Any more questions?

765
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:38,355
Questions, I have many!

766
01:23:42,154 --> 01:23:43,571
Welcome.

767
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:48,779
What can I get you?

768
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,488
My identity!

769
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,529
Will you show me the mail please?

770
01:23:56,613 --> 01:23:57,654
One sec.

771
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:15,256
Here.
You sent me this mail 15 days ago.

772
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,154
But what can one know from this mail?

773
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:26,779
This mail could have
been sent by anyone?

774
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:28,191
Could have been.

775
01:24:28,658 --> 01:24:30,639
But it could also
have been sent by Karan!

776
01:24:32,187 --> 01:24:36,029
You said in the mail,
that you wanted to show me something.

777
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:37,376
What is that?

778
01:24:37,456 --> 01:24:38,696
How should I know?

779
01:24:39,383 --> 01:24:42,029
You are talking as
if I am Karan!

780
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:43,574
If you still don't want to believe..

781
01:24:43,654 --> 01:24:46,363
Just a minute.
We met on the bus, right?

782
01:24:46,443 --> 01:24:47,279
Hmm.

783
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:48,529
Where was the bus going?

784
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:50,071
Bern.

785
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,113
From where?

786
01:24:51,196 --> 01:24:52,404
Champery.

787
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:54,453
Champery to Bern..

788
01:24:55,117 --> 01:24:56,273
Karan Bern.

789
01:24:58,997 --> 01:25:00,955
You check I will get you some juice.

790
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:12,830
Oh my God!

791
01:25:58,761 --> 01:25:59,958
Wait.

792
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:10,188
Hi. I was not able to sleep,
so I thought..

793
01:28:12,307 --> 01:28:13,955
What is wrong Armin?

794
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:17,830
I have not done anything Kaavya..

795
01:28:19,497 --> 01:28:20,955
What have you not done?

796
01:28:26,164 --> 01:28:29,830
Who is this?
And why did you kill her?

797
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,622
Please believe me Kaavya.
I have not done anything!

798
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:34,914
I have not killed anyone.

799
01:28:34,997 --> 01:28:38,414
I don't even know her,
why would I kill her?

800
01:28:39,164 --> 01:28:40,789
What is her body doing here?

801
01:28:41,372 --> 01:28:42,664
I don't know.

802
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,459
I have not killed her.

803
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:47,164
But who will believe you?

804
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:52,205
You will, right?

805
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:54,914
Of course I will.

806
01:28:55,205 --> 01:29:00,247
Now you believe me that there is a
conspiracy against you!

807
01:29:01,622 --> 01:29:04,289
What better confirmation do you want?

808
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:08,205
I don't know.

809
01:29:09,747 --> 01:29:10,951
I don't..

810
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:14,289
..what should I do?

811
01:29:15,705 --> 01:29:17,330
You will have to go from here.

812
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:19,789
Where?

813
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:22,580
I am trapped from everywhere.

814
01:29:25,244 --> 01:29:26,955
I am in a mousetrap!

815
01:29:27,914 --> 01:29:29,747
And all alone..

816
01:29:33,323 --> 01:29:34,622
You are not alone..

817
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:38,955
No Kaavya, I don't want
to drag you into all this.

818
01:29:39,497 --> 01:29:40,914
Not at all!

819
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:44,997
Do I still need to tell you..

820
01:29:47,952 --> 01:29:49,955
I am with you Armin..

821
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:52,955
Nothing will happen to you..

822
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:57,789
I won't let anything happen!

823
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:02,622
But first we will have
to get rid of the body..

824
01:30:02,872 --> 01:30:03,830
Okay?

825
01:30:05,955 --> 01:30:08,872
Armin.. Armin move!

826
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:25,455
Careful.

827
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,080
Let's go..

828
01:30:47,914 --> 01:30:49,455
Armin, let's go!

829
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:56,447
<i>Armin, you quickly pack your stuff,
I will meet you in 10 minutes!</i>

830
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,205
Bag?

831
01:34:06,778 --> 01:34:09,403
<i># This is how..#</i>

832
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:12,653
<i># We met..#</i>

833
01:34:12,737 --> 01:34:20,112
<i># The way rain meets the sky. #</i>

834
01:34:22,778 --> 01:34:27,862
<i># It was love at first sight. #</i>

835
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:36,153
<i># For the poor heart. #</i>

836
01:34:42,987 --> 01:34:44,695
Are you following me?

837
01:34:45,278 --> 01:34:46,362
Yes!

838
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:48,820
Oh! That simple!

839
01:34:50,528 --> 01:34:52,737
We can make it
complicated if you like!

840
01:34:53,612 --> 01:34:54,820
Really?

841
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,987
Will you have coffee with me?

842
01:34:58,028 --> 01:34:59,195
No, I am busy.

843
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,570
How about tomorrow?

844
01:35:02,737 --> 01:35:04,692
You will have to follow
me again for that!

845
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:13,570
Yes?

846
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:15,153
Hello stranger!

847
01:35:16,528 --> 01:35:17,820
Hello yourself.

848
01:35:26,195 --> 01:35:27,362
If you had stayed in
Paris for a few more days..

849
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:28,862
I would have all but forgotten you!

850
01:35:31,195 --> 01:35:32,612
Not so easily..

851
01:35:38,403 --> 01:35:39,778
Do you remember something now?

852
01:35:41,237 --> 01:35:42,612
I really missed you!

853
01:35:44,778 --> 01:35:46,237
And I found you!

854
01:35:46,403 --> 01:35:52,653
# Just be in my arms..#
- Shall we?

855
01:35:52,862 --> 01:35:56,237
<i># Till the sun sets..# </i>

856
01:35:56,419 --> 01:36:00,903

857
01:36:02,295 --> 01:36:08,653

864
01:36:35,695 --> 01:36:37,820
<i>Hi!</i>
-See you tomorrow.

865
01:36:37,987 --> 01:36:38,612
<i>Bye.</i>

866
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:39,570
<i>Bye.</i>

867
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:41,945
What's up?

868
01:36:42,028 --> 01:36:45,112
God! Why didn't you come in?

869
01:36:47,275 --> 01:36:48,403
Let's go.

870
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,445
How was your trip to Sion?

871
01:36:50,528 --> 01:36:51,790
Amazing!

872
01:36:52,487 --> 01:36:53,903
I met Fabian Schneider.

873
01:36:53,987 --> 01:36:56,278
Brilliant, how he runs a fake
passport business.

874
01:36:56,612 --> 01:36:58,737
And lucky me, he even met me.

875
01:36:59,028 --> 01:36:59,820
Come.

876
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:05,612
Every character in your story is real,
except me..

877
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:09,737
My story..my characters.. and
my wish..

878
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,112
..do you have a problem?

879
01:37:11,612 --> 01:37:12,903
Whatever.

880
01:37:14,362 --> 01:37:15,653
Give me cigarettes please.

881
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:20,362
Why do you always keep
your cigarettes in my purse?

882
01:37:21,195 --> 01:37:22,570
Because you don't smoke!

883
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,070
Hi Pooja!
- Hi.

884
01:37:49,195 --> 01:37:50,362
Is Karan here?

885
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,278
Yeah, he is inside!

886
01:37:51,362 --> 01:37:52,445
Okay.

887
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:53,898
What?

888
01:37:57,653 --> 01:37:59,945
Happy birthday to you..

889
01:38:00,153 --> 01:38:02,532
Happy birthday to you..

890
01:38:02,612 --> 01:38:04,737
Happy birthday dear Karan!

891
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:05,778
Do you want to crush me or what?

892
01:38:05,862 --> 01:38:08,362
Happy birthday to you..
- Thank you.

893
01:38:08,528 --> 01:38:11,612
Grace, but Karan's
birthday is tomorrow.

894
01:38:11,862 --> 01:38:15,653
This is her old habit of wishing
me a day before the birthday!

895
01:38:15,737 --> 01:38:18,528
Yes, I have to be
the first to wish you!

896
01:38:18,612 --> 01:38:20,445
Okay! Now this is the plan..

897
01:38:20,528 --> 01:38:23,112
Dinner at Lasalle..
.. Concert at Hallenstadion..

898
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:24,532
..and drinks at he Rooftop Bar.

899
01:38:24,612 --> 01:38:27,320
In short,
for the next 3 hours, I am the boss!

900
01:38:27,403 --> 01:38:29,320
No questions, no answers!
Shall we go..?

901
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:30,820
But Grace we have just
come from outside and..

902
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:31,695
No no no no no..

903
01:38:31,778 --> 01:38:34,028
The boss can beep you
if you beep around with her!

904
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,320
So let's get the f*** out of here!

905
01:38:35,403 --> 01:38:38,028
Let's go... let's go.
- At least let me take my wallet..

906
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:39,195
I am there na..

907
01:38:39,278 --> 01:38:41,862
<i>Always so excited..
it's just a birthday..</i>

908
01:38:41,945 --> 01:38:44,778
<i>After all we are adults now!
- Adults.. not old!</i>

909
01:38:45,028 --> 01:38:46,320
<i>Late as always.</i>

910
01:38:47,362 --> 01:38:49,237
I have some news for you.
- What's that?

911
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,987
I have quit my job!

912
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:52,237
Are you mad?

913
01:38:52,695 --> 01:38:53,820
You were so happy with your job.

914
01:38:53,903 --> 01:38:55,653
And your pay was terrific.
Why did you quit?

915
01:38:55,737 --> 01:39:00,653
No-no. I want to give
all my time to you, so that..

916
01:39:00,737 --> 01:39:02,070
..you can complete your book!

917
01:39:02,153 --> 01:39:04,616
Who told you I am not
writing my book properly?

918
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:06,612
Why did you have to quit?

919
01:39:07,112 --> 01:39:10,070
I have made up my mind and
there are no two ways about it!

920
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:11,612
Done is done!

921
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,032
<i>So should we celebrate now?</i>

922
01:39:13,112 --> 01:39:15,778
<i>Yeah sure! Let's celebrate.</i>

923
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,487
If you keep on looking
at me like this how can I write?

924
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,331
If I don't look at you how do I live!

925
01:40:29,573 --> 01:40:39,403
<i># A dusky night..# </i>

926
01:40:39,965 --> 01:40:45,237
<i># That will pass us by..#</i>

927
01:40:45,408 --> 01:40:50,528
<i># In a drunken haze..# </i>

928
01:40:50,945 --> 01:41:03,153
<i># I will remember you..# </i>

929
01:41:04,528 --> 01:41:14,320
<i># I will look for you in pictures..# </i>

930
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:25,945
<i># If I don't find your face,
I will die..# </i>

931
01:41:26,362 --> 01:41:38,612
<i># I will remember you..# </i>

932
01:41:39,237 --> 01:41:41,195
Stop it ya! Please stop it!

933
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:42,949
Stop looking after me!

934
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,320
And stop behaving like
this writer's wife please..

935
01:41:45,671 --> 01:41:47,237
It cannot be a compulsion!

936
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:51,655
Compulsion?
What are you talking about?

937
01:41:52,237 --> 01:41:53,487
You know what..

938
01:41:53,862 --> 01:41:55,195
.. it's as if I am
being forced to write..

939
01:41:55,445 --> 01:41:56,320
.. I am writing out of fear..

940
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:58,195
Every morning I wake up with
the fear that I have to write..

941
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,028
..because my wife
has left her job for me..

942
01:42:00,112 --> 01:42:01,737
.. has stopped living,
so that I can write.

943
01:42:02,112 --> 01:42:06,153
Please Pooja, I don't need
your time to write, but my own time.

944
01:42:06,237 --> 01:42:07,112
My own time!

945
01:42:07,403 --> 01:42:09,195
But I was just..
- Just leave it!

946
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,320
If I leave..
you won't be able to live!

947
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:14,070
Excuse me!

948
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:16,112
I will manage quite well.

949
01:42:16,403 --> 01:42:17,403
You want to try it?

950
01:42:17,653 --> 01:42:18,573
I don't want to talk about it!?

951
01:42:18,653 --> 01:42:20,695
No-no .. You want to try it?

952
01:42:20,945 --> 01:42:23,862
Karan, I don't want to listen to this.
I said I don't want to talk about this!

953
01:42:24,153 --> 01:42:26,445
I too don't want to talk about this!
Neither do I want to write!

954
01:42:28,028 --> 01:42:28,986
Get lost!

955
01:42:31,097 --> 01:42:33,195
You can come back home,
once you cool down..

956
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,862
It's all over Grace.

957
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,237
I can't think.. Can't write..

958
01:42:42,903 --> 01:42:44,195
Can't breathe!

959
01:42:45,362 --> 01:42:47,153
She is literally colonizing my mind!

960
01:42:47,612 --> 01:42:49,487
Karan, she is just taking care of you!

961
01:42:50,028 --> 01:42:51,862
How can you call it suffocation?

962
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,070
If she takes care, it's a problem!

963
01:42:54,362 --> 01:42:55,278
If she doesn't take care,
then too it's a problem!

964
01:42:55,362 --> 01:42:58,528
You know what, love is about giving
space.. and not occupying it!

965
01:42:59,195 --> 01:43:00,987
And she does not
need to look after me..

966
01:43:01,862 --> 01:43:03,945
..at times she needs
to look away from me!

967
01:43:06,609 --> 01:43:10,028
You know.. if one does not
need a reason to fall in love..

968
01:43:10,778 --> 01:43:13,528
..One should not need a reason
to fall out of love as well!

969
01:43:14,570 --> 01:43:15,695
There should be a reason..

970
01:43:16,987 --> 01:43:18,028
..and there is!

971
01:43:18,653 --> 01:43:19,112
Pooja?

972
01:43:19,237 --> 01:43:21,570
And that too I can see quite clearly!

973
01:43:22,028 --> 01:43:23,487
Pooja, please!
- Pooja, we are just friends!

974
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,528
Pooja!
- Friends?

975
01:43:24,612 --> 01:43:25,532
Pooja! Please not here!

976
01:43:25,612 --> 01:43:27,070
F*** Friends!
- Pooja, please not here!

977
01:43:27,153 --> 01:43:28,695
That's what you want to be, right!?
- Pooja stop!

978
01:43:28,778 --> 01:43:30,362
Don't you understand
he is a married man!

979
01:43:30,653 --> 01:43:32,445
He is a married man!
- You bit**

980
01:43:32,528 --> 01:43:33,403
Pooja!
- Why don't you leave him alone!

981
01:43:33,487 --> 01:43:35,487
<i>You are losing it, Pooja!
- Why can't you just leave us alone!</i>

982
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:36,903
<i>What will you take to leave him alone!</i>

983
01:43:36,987 --> 01:43:38,953
<i>Leave my hand Karan!</i>

984
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:46,695
It's good for a first draft.
Needs some polishing though.

985
01:43:46,903 --> 01:43:48,320
Oh! Thank you.

986
01:43:49,487 --> 01:43:50,778
Hi Pooja!

987
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,278
Hi Grace!

988
01:43:56,612 --> 01:43:58,153
It's so nice to see you!

989
01:43:59,695 --> 01:44:02,820
Karan was insisting
that I read his first draft.

990
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:05,570
Of course!

991
01:44:05,987 --> 01:44:08,237
I don't exist for him.. to read it..

992
01:44:08,653 --> 01:44:10,820
Grace, you continue reading!

993
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:14,237
Grace, would you like some coffee?

994
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,695
No thanks! I am fine.

995
01:44:16,945 --> 01:44:18,903
Of course you are!
- Pooja!

996
01:44:19,112 --> 01:44:20,070
Have you lost it!

997
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:21,278
You have lost your mind!

998
01:44:21,362 --> 01:44:23,278
I am sorry, Grace! I am very sorry!

999
01:44:23,362 --> 01:44:25,487
How dare you slap my friend!
Say sorry!

1000
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,237
Say sorry right now!

1001
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:29,112
F*** you! The both of you!

1002
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:31,862
Every time the same thing!

1003
01:44:31,945 --> 01:44:32,573
I am sorry!

1004
01:44:32,653 --> 01:44:34,112
Don't you understand?

1005
01:44:36,028 --> 01:44:37,195
It's over!

1006
01:44:37,987 --> 01:44:38,945
What?

1007
01:44:41,195 --> 01:44:42,612
It's over!

1008
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:50,528
<i># The heart lay burdened..# </i>

1009
01:44:50,653 --> 01:44:55,987
<i># I found you, yet lost you..# </i>

1010
01:44:56,112 --> 01:45:01,403
<i># Life froze in pain..# </i>

1011
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:06,945
<i># Where can I find you,
please tell me the place..# </i>

1012
01:45:07,112 --> 01:45:11,695
<i># Why did you leave,
give me the reason..# </i>

1013
01:45:11,778 --> 01:45:17,903
<i># Come into my arms again..# </i>

1014
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:28,862
.<i># Every belief that has broken,
lies in pieces..# </i>

1015
01:45:39,195 --> 01:45:44,441
<i># I will remember you..
I will remember you..# </i>

1016
01:45:47,945 --> 01:45:49,195
I am almost done.

1017
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,903
Did I leave it in your room?

1018
01:46:10,112 --> 01:46:11,368
What?

1019
01:46:16,612 --> 01:46:19,529
I had no idea nicotine would have
such an effect...

1020
01:46:21,153 --> 01:46:22,820
..that it will bring back my memory!

1021
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:28,813
Now I know why
I used to be so irritated..

1022
01:46:30,112 --> 01:46:32,653
Because I craved for cigarettes..

1023
01:46:33,945 --> 01:46:35,153
What are you saying?

1024
01:46:35,487 --> 01:46:39,737
The thing which can take
a life can also save a life!

1025
01:46:41,153 --> 01:46:42,737
I have got my identity, Kaavya!

1026
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:52,278
I have finally solved it

1027
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:54,781
What?

1028
01:46:56,862 --> 01:46:59,237
When I told Rhea the truth..

1029
01:47:00,195 --> 01:47:02,112
..instead of forgiving me

1030
01:47:02,445 --> 01:47:03,653
She hated me..

1031
01:47:07,528 --> 01:47:10,115
For the first time I
spoke the truth to someone..

1032
01:47:11,528 --> 01:47:13,028
But she wanted to hear a lie..

1033
01:47:13,237 --> 01:47:15,320
I will never forgive you.

1034
01:47:17,028 --> 01:47:18,612
<i>When Rhea got to know the truth...</i>

1035
01:47:19,919 --> 01:47:22,487
She wanted to hand
me over to the police..

1036
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,070
I had to choose between us.

1037
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,570
I chose myself!

1038
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:34,820
They say love kills..

1039
01:47:36,237 --> 01:47:37,612
It actually does!

1040
01:47:40,028 --> 01:47:42,487
So you killed Rhea?

1041
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:48,945
That means the girl whom
we met was a different Rhea?

1042
01:47:49,778 --> 01:47:51,112
I don't know.

1043
01:47:51,862 --> 01:47:54,487
But this conspiracy
will be solved soon..

1044
01:47:55,649 --> 01:47:58,987
Because I remember very
well where I killed her.

1045
01:47:59,984 --> 01:48:02,612
After reaching there it
will be proved that I am Armin!

1046
01:48:02,903 --> 01:48:06,278
But when you know it in your
head that you are Armin..

1047
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:09,778
And you are the one who
killed Rhea or whatever...

1048
01:48:09,987 --> 01:48:12,778
Why don't you believe in yourself?

1049
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,362
Why do you want to go there?

1050
01:48:14,528 --> 01:48:16,070
Why do you need confirmation?

1051
01:48:18,695 --> 01:48:23,695
Now I do not want to believe what is
in my mind.. but what is real!

1052
01:48:25,112 --> 01:48:26,028
Let's go.

1053
01:49:09,878 --> 01:49:11,295
<i>Pooja! drive slowly.</i>

1054
01:50:23,545 --> 01:50:27,115
You knew all the time
that I did not kill anyone..

1055
01:50:28,664 --> 01:50:30,962
That I mixed fact with fiction!

1056
01:50:33,462 --> 01:50:36,144
I connected my book with my life.

1057
01:50:37,957 --> 01:50:39,545
You are my wife, Pooja!

1058
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,003
I remember everything.

1059
01:50:45,104 --> 01:50:46,628
What were you waiting for?

1060
01:50:48,045 --> 01:50:51,420
For so many days I kept on suffering.

1061
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,170
Died every day thinking
that I have killed someone!

1062
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,445
And you..

1063
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:01,295
..Inspite of knowing everything..

1064
01:51:02,503 --> 01:51:03,378
And, you wanted to kill me?

1065
01:51:03,462 --> 01:51:04,795
I would want to kill you?

1066
01:51:05,962 --> 01:51:06,920
I..

1067
01:51:07,977 --> 01:51:10,003
Who can do anything for you.

1068
01:51:10,503 --> 01:51:12,628
Who has left everything for you..

1069
01:51:15,503 --> 01:51:19,837
Whereas you left me and
started living with Grace!

1070
01:51:21,837 --> 01:51:23,253
<i>How could I tolerate it?</i>

1071
01:51:23,628 --> 01:51:24,628
Look Karan!
- One minute, Grace!

1072
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:25,878
Karan!

1073
01:51:26,503 --> 01:51:28,545
Oh my God! 'What If'.

1074
01:51:29,212 --> 01:51:29,837
My book!

1075
01:51:29,962 --> 01:51:31,753
I know, I am so happy for you Karan!
- When did it come?

1076
01:51:31,837 --> 01:51:32,712
I have been dying to see this!

1077
01:51:32,792 --> 01:51:33,837
Finally the galleys!

1078
01:51:34,128 --> 01:51:34,962
When will it be in the market?

1079
01:51:35,045 --> 01:51:36,712
'What if'. Maybe in a few months.

1080
01:51:37,003 --> 01:51:38,837
<i>Do you know whom do I
want to give the first copy to?</i>

1081
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,670
<i>Me of course!</i>

1082
01:51:39,795 --> 01:51:43,503
Of course you. But before you..
..to Rhea!

1083
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,295
<i>What say?
She has been my inspiration!</i>

1084
01:51:46,378 --> 01:51:48,795
Karan, I hope you haven't
fallen in love with Rhea!

1085
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,628
Armin is in love with Rhea after all.

1086
01:51:50,712 --> 01:51:51,837
But you are Karan!

1087
01:51:52,045 --> 01:51:53,378
When did I say I am Armin?

1088
01:51:53,462 --> 01:51:55,503
Oh! You are so confusing! Let me see..

1089
01:51:55,878 --> 01:52:00,003
You know what, I am going to Champery
the first thing in the morning.

1090
01:52:00,587 --> 01:52:04,503
To give the book to the
one who inspired me. Rhea Wagner!

1091
01:52:04,712 --> 01:52:07,045
As it is I have to go Montreux,
You get down at Champery.

1092
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:10,837
<i>When I heard that you were
going to Champery to meet Rhea..</i>

1093
01:52:12,628 --> 01:52:15,170
<i>.. I thought I could
mend things with you.</i>

1094
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,587
<i>That is why I followed you.</i>

1095
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,837
It was just an accident Karan!

1096
01:52:26,045 --> 01:52:28,253
Whatever you did to me..

1097
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:32,462
<i>..came back to me in the car and I..</i>

1098
01:52:32,962 --> 01:52:35,128
<i>.. I don't know how I..?</i>

1099
01:52:37,471 --> 01:52:41,545
<i>When you did not recognize
me in the hospital..</i>

1100
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:47,420
What do you want?
Do I know you?

1101
01:52:47,503 --> 01:52:50,295
<i>I understood that you
didn't remember anything..</i>

1102
01:52:50,545 --> 01:52:54,337
<i>And then you said your name as Armin.</i>

1103
01:52:54,586 --> 01:53:00,212
<i>I understood that you had
started living your book's character.</i>

1104
01:53:03,545 --> 01:53:05,795
Life gave me another chance.

1105
01:53:07,295 --> 01:53:10,128
Where I could live with you again.

1106
01:53:11,645 --> 01:53:14,337
<i>And you even started
falling in love with me again.</i>

1107
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:17,837
<i># This is how you moved away. #</i>

1108
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,170
<i># Like life..#</i>

1109
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:22,753
<i># And separation of living it.#</i>

1110
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:28,587
That Grace came back into our lives
again, and messed up everything.

1111
01:53:30,003 --> 01:53:31,795
<i>She could never let us be!</i>

1112
01:53:32,378 --> 01:53:34,462
You know what Karan has gone out..

1113
01:53:34,545 --> 01:53:37,003
..why don't you come with me?

1114
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,045
Yeah, sure!

1115
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:40,920
I am sure he will be
very happy to see you..

1116
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:42,837
Yeah, let's go!

1117
01:53:44,003 --> 01:53:44,962
Dead!

1118
01:53:48,003 --> 01:53:51,628
You can go to such
extremes for love, Pooja!

1119
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:53,378
I don't believe you!

1120
01:53:54,128 --> 01:53:57,045
'Everything is fair in love',
is not just a saying..

1121
01:53:58,706 --> 01:54:01,465
.. People like us have
the courage to do it..

1122
01:54:02,545 --> 01:54:04,712
..and that is how people quote us!

1123
01:54:07,837 --> 01:54:12,087
It takes courage to love someone,
who doesn't love you!

1124
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:20,503
I love you because I love you,
not because you love me!

1125
01:54:22,291 --> 01:54:24,420
Will you ever understand that!

1126
01:54:25,429 --> 01:54:30,128
If you love someone and
can stay without that person..

1127
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:34,674
..then maybe you
have never really loved!

1128
01:54:37,916 --> 01:54:42,962
How can I live knowing
that I don't know you..

1129
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:51,087
..that I can't touch you.. feel you..

1130
01:54:53,128 --> 01:54:54,712
..that I can't make love to you!

1131
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:58,295
<i># If you tell me..# </i>

1132
01:54:58,378 --> 01:55:01,587
<i># Will die for you..# </i>

1133
01:55:01,962 --> 01:55:04,878
<i># Just say it..# </i>

1134
01:55:05,295 --> 01:55:06,962
<i># Just say yes..# </i>

1135
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,670
Please Karan, don't say it!
- Pooja, but this is the truth!

1136
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,584
Karan, please.. please don't say it!

1137
01:55:13,837 --> 01:55:15,128
We can't stay together!
- <i># My breath. #</i>

1138
01:55:15,212 --> 01:55:18,837
Don't say it. Please! Please Karan..
- <i># Is counting. #</i>

1139
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:20,212
Please..

1140
01:55:20,503 --> 01:55:27,221
<i># Few that remain..# </i>

1141
01:55:29,837 --> 01:55:35,212
<i># If you are not there..# </i>

1142
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:43,712
<i># This journey has no meaning..# </i>

1143
01:55:59,689 --> 01:56:06,003
<i># Can I look at you one last time..# </i>

1144
01:56:07,045 --> 01:56:13,212
<i># Can I kiss you one last time..# </i>

1145
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:21,003
<i># Breath might not last..#</i>
- Pooja...

1146
01:56:22,337 --> 01:56:27,670
<i># Memory might not last..# </i>

1147
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:36,045
<i># In love I lost everything..# </i>

1148
01:56:36,663 --> 01:56:43,545
<i># Whatever happened
was because of the heart..# </i>

1149
01:56:44,003 --> 01:56:50,337
<i># Just looking at you..
My world..# </i>

1150
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:54,837
<i># Even if you have lied..# </i>

1151
01:56:54,920 --> 01:57:02,837
<i># Just love me one last time..# </i>

1152
01:57:55,795 --> 01:58:02,337
<i># Can I look for you once..# </i>

1153
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:10,420
<i># Can I tell you one last time..# </i>

1154
01:58:10,962 --> 01:58:17,712
<i># Breath might not last..# </i>

1155
01:58:18,378 --> 01:58:25,212
<i># Memory might not last..# </i>

1156
01:58:25,795 --> 01:58:31,420
<i># Breath might not last..# </i>

1157
01:58:33,128 --> 01:58:40,003
<i># Memory might not last..# </i>

1158
01:58:49,962 --> 01:58:53,712
<i>In spite of loving Rhea so much,
Armin killed her!</i>

1159
01:58:54,231 --> 01:58:56,670
<i>And Pooja killed herself for love!</i>

1160
01:58:57,087 --> 01:59:01,920
<i>I am still not sure,
if there is a right and wrong in love?</i>

1161
01:59:02,378 --> 01:59:04,003
It's really sad.

1162
01:59:06,738 --> 01:59:08,920
So.. who am I?

1163
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,087
Who am I?

1164
01:59:12,274 --> 01:59:14,170
You are who you are in real life!

1165
01:59:15,722 --> 01:59:16,670
Rhea!

1166
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:24,712
I put your real life
character into my book.

1167
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:35,420
You know when we met on the bus..
..I was looking for my characters.

1168
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:42,128
And when I saw you
I found my character.

1169
01:59:43,837 --> 01:59:50,045
When I woke up in the hospital,
my book, my characters..you..

1170
01:59:51,203 --> 01:59:53,503
..were playing so much on my mind..

1171
01:59:54,962 --> 01:59:57,503
..that I could not think
beyond Armin and Rhea!

1172
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:02,135
So, are you Armin or Karan?

1173
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:05,170
Whenever a writer is etching
out his main character..

1174
02:00:06,087 --> 02:00:10,837
..he picks up a lot
of shades from his own life.

1175
02:00:11,087 --> 02:00:12,503
Of course I am Karan..

1176
02:00:14,295 --> 02:00:19,337
..but a lot of Karan is in Armin too!

1177
02:00:20,426 --> 02:00:23,837
Well, I don't ever
want to be a writer!

1178
02:00:24,552 --> 02:00:25,546
Me too!

1179
02:01:01,878 --> 02:01:03,045
Who is that ?

1180
02:01:10,962 --> 02:01:12,170
My next contract.

1181
02:01:13,482 --> 02:01:20,524
<i># It is the fever of being alive..# </i>

1182
02:01:22,232 --> 02:01:29,399
<i># It is the fever of being alive..# </i>

1183
02:01:57,565 --> 02:02:01,315
<i># You are the sign..# </i>

1184
02:02:01,774 --> 02:02:03,774
<i># That I exist..# </i>

1185
02:02:03,857 --> 02:02:06,274
<i># How do I meet you again..# </i>

1186
02:02:06,357 --> 02:02:10,440
<i># You keep an eye..# </i>

1187
02:02:10,565 --> 02:02:14,857
<i># On my every breath..
So that I come alive again..# </i>

1188
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:19,190
<i># Life was without a care..# </i>

1189
02:02:19,274 --> 02:02:23,607
<i># I needed her..
To go through the night..# </i>

1190
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:27,774
<i># You are my story # </i>

1191
02:02:28,107 --> 02:02:32,107
<i># You live through me..# </i>

1192
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:54,440
<i># Life was without a care..# </i>

1193
02:02:54,565 --> 02:02:58,607
<i># I needed her..
To go through the night..# </i>

1194
02:02:59,107 --> 02:03:06,274
<i># It is the fever of being alive..# </i>

1195
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:14,565
<i># It is the fever of being alive..# </i>
