1
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,993
Now listen. Tell Simon that
Tommy has the plans and the model.

2
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,496
I'll be back in about ten days,
and I can take over then.

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,661
Well, it's all come at a bad time, really.

4
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,789
Dan? Hello?

5
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,244
It always happens in the same place.

6
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,832
Quite convenient, actually.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,242
You're having a few days
away from the wee ones, are you?

8
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,825
Er, just a bit of peace and quiet, really.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,491
You're going to the right place
for that, boy.

10
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,414
There you go.

11
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,290
Now, the CB
goes straight through to me.

12
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,823
If you need help, just call.

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,662
I'll be over on Saturday
unless I hear from you. OK?

14
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,573
- Thank you, Doug.
- Thanks, Doug.

15
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,456
Be good!

16
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,199
Kate! I was thinking we'd go for a walk.

17
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,994
Maybe after breakfast?

18
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,582
- Kate?
- Uh-huh?

19
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,743
I was thinking we could do that walk.
You know the one? Around the coast?

20
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:35,830
- Let's just see how I go with this, OK?

21
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,824
OK. Yeah.

22
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,115
Oh...

23
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,414
You OK?

24
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,198
Ready?

25
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,075
- Aw, no, they're babies!
- What are you talking about?

26
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,913
We'll grill these two feckers on toast
with a bit of lemon, and mwah!

27
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,826
- Come on, bring them in.
- Ah... le poisson!

28
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,908
Wow.

29
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,699
Look at that.

30
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,331
Mm.

31
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,909
- 2002, huh?
- Mm-hm.

32
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,458
All right. I'll get rid of these.

33
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,948
Shit!

34
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,993
Oh, great.

35
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,492
- How was it?
- It was a cold bath.

36
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,249
Doug'll be here in the morning.
He'll sort it out.

37
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,123
Good.

38
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,290
I don't recall it giving us any trouble
last time.

39
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,074
It's a while since
you've been here, though.

40
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,742
Now, she's full of character,
I'll give you that.

41
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,249
She's never down for long.

42
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,328
No, I tried that, mate. It didn't work.

43
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,161
- There we are.

44
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,665
You've got to keep it down
for a count of three.

45
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,915
- Ah.
- Keep it down hard, mind.

46
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:10,749
To kick-start her again, read these
and that'll do the trick. Good man.

47
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,782
Right.

48
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,916
Oh! I almost forgot.

49
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,995
- There's a present from Mrs. Doug.
- Ah!

50
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,325
Now, she baked them specially,
so watch your teeth.

51
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,116
That's very kind.
Tell her thanks very much from us.

52
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,989
Not much for her to do up this part
of the world. It's that, or talk to me.

53
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,204
- And I tell you, I'm never short of cake.

54
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,411
- How are you getting on here, you two?
- Good.

55
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,699
Not gone mad yet?

56
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,325
No, we love this island.
We've had some good times here.

57
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,491
You've found them again, have you?

58
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:58,247
- Right, I'll see you later, Martin.
- Great. Thanks a million, Doug. Bye.

59
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,956
Kate?

60
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,322
- Kate, I was calling you.
- Hang on a second!

61
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,244
Just give me a minute, OK?

62
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,000
Well... the dinner's on the table.

63
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,164
Martin!

64
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,322
- Martin!
- Yeah! I'm down here.

65
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,665
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's gone again.

66
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,286
That's a good look.

67
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,619
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

68
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,158
I was just running a bath,
and it just went.

69
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,289
- Any luck.
- No.

70
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,780
I've held it down for three.
That doesn't seem to be working.

71
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,415
So it says, "Use a ratchet screwdriver.

72
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,121
"Make sure the isolating switch
on the front of the generator is off.

73
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:49,080
We have an "intermittent malfunction
of the cut-out".

74
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,412
Yeah, definitely got that.

75
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,244
Yeah.

76
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,745
What the fuck is a ratchet screwdriver?

77
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,910
Shit!

78
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,575
- Doug, Martin's been injured.

79
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,288
The generator
practically blew up on him. Over.

80
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,201
<i>It's a hairy old thing, but I didn't know
it had gone that bad. Over.</i>

81
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,699
Doug, it's... Don't worry.

82
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,290
<i>Aye, well, I'll bring my doctor
over anyway.</i>

83
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,656
<i>It'll be tomorrow now. Don't touch
the generator until we get there. Over.</i>

84
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,698
All right.

85
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,745
Thanks, Doug. See you. Over and out.

86
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,407
Over and out.

87
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,449
There's absolutely nothing.

88
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,742
I guess I'll try and call him
on the CB again.

89
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:32,160
Yeah. It's just impossible
to cook on a fire.

90
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,250
Er... are you OK with bread and cheese?

91
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,241
It's fine, Kate. I'll sort it out.

92
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,823
What are you doing?

93
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,491
I was getting some wood
and I found this thing.

94
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,249
We've waited all day
and Doug hasn't turned up.

95
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,329
It's getting dark.
We've got to sort this out.

96
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,075
Doug, this is
the Fairweather Cottage. Over.

97
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,074
Come on.

98
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,244
This is the Fairweather Cottage. Over.

99
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,573
If you'd just calm down...

100
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,992
Could we row to him?
Could we row to the mainland?

101
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,328
- It's miles away. It's freezing.
- OK. So we could be just stranded here.

102
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,957
Please don't be silly. Come on.

103
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,083
What did we think, coming back here?

104
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,241
Coming back to the same place,

105
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,454
like we're gonna just solve
all our problems.

106
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,661
I don't see what that has to do with this.

107
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,826
Come on, Martin, this is just torture,
being back here!

108
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,615
Kate...!

109
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,999
I'm really trying my best here.

110
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,829
If you want me to apologies again, I will.

111
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:50,495
I am so... so sorry... I wasn't there.

112
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,285
I'm sorry the power went out, I'm sorry
the fucking generator exploded.

113
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,619
I'm sorry for bringing us back here.

114
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,078
I'm sorry for all of it.

115
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,328
You didn't even want him.

116
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,620
Jesus Christ. Please...

117
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,244
Martin!

118
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,829
There's someone here! I just saw them!

119
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:26,079
This is Fairweather Cottage
on Blackholme Island.

120
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,990
We need to report an injured man.

121
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,699
We need medical assistance, please.
Over and out.

122
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:37,332
Doug, if you can hear us, this is
Martin and Kate. Please contact us.

123
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,498
Just think for a second.

124
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,699
OK, he just...

125
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,659
He's got to have come on a boat
from the mainland.

126
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,915
Then the boat would be at the beach.

127
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,161
You go, and I'll stay with the CB.

128
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,119
OK, I'll be back.

129
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,573
Shit.

130
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,331
No boat. Nothing.

131
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,748
What?

132
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,664
Fucking hell.

133
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,624
Maybe we should just go. Let's just go.

134
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:18,660
Kate, listen. There's no boat,
there's no way out, there's nothing.

135
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,825
-A fucking gun!
- I know.

136
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,159
- OK, we have to get it off him.
- Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,698
- Listen, Kate.
- No.

138
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,165
If he's from the military,
he'll understand.

139
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,450
If he's not in the military,
we don't know who the hell he is.

140
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,990
OK.

141
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,740
Go. Bedroom.

142
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,078
Water. I need some water.

143
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,414
I need some water.

144
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,956
What happened?

145
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,124
I was making a crossing
in some rough water

146
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,954
and my boat
got sucked into the rocks.

147
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,490
Please.

148
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,286
Martin!

149
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,908
You OK?

150
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,789
Er...

151
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,665
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

152
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,324
Private Jack Coleman.
Tactical Response.

153
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,990
Martin Kennedy.

154
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,415
Thank you both for taking me in.

155
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:24,121
- His boat sank.
- I was trying to avoid those rocks.

156
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,157
And as I was saying to...

157
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,075
- I'm Kate.
- ...Kate.

158
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,706
The tides in that water...

159
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,575
I just remember the rocks
and the water coming in.

160
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,160
Are you Army? Navy?

161
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,324
Army.

162
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,833
We're doing a reconnaissance exercise
in the area.

163
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,332
Do you think they're looking for you?

164
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,115
Yeah.

165
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,324
Does your CB work?

166
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,322
Er... No, actually. It's been down
for the last two days. I can't...

167
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,707
I can't get through to the owner, Doug.

168
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,246
He set it to his frequency
but I haven't been able to get through.

169
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,998
Maybe you could have a look.

170
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,283
I should be able to fix it.

171
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,073
So it's just the two of you?

172
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,411
On the island?

173
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,823
Yes.

174
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,447
Yes. Doug is... Doug is the owner.
He's on the mainland.

175
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,331
Ah.

176
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,289
It's just in there.

177
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,994
And there's a bathroom opposite.

178
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:43,706
- Do you think you need anything else?
- I don't think so, no. Thank you.

179
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,573
- Get some rest.
- Thanks.

180
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,581
I need to speak with you alone.

181
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,289
Are you going to give it to him?

182
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,448
No.

183
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,078
No.

184
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,207
Erm... I'm just gonna go
talk to him for a sec.

185
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,824
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

186
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,332
What... What are you doing?

187
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,659
Do you want to take a seat for me,
Martin?

188
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,582
No, actually, I'm fine.

189
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,582
I'm gonna tell you something,

190
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,490
and you're gonna listen.

191
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,703
And then you're gonna do as I say.

192
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,742
These three things are essential
to the safety of you and your wife.

193
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,579
Do you understand me so far?

194
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,490
Yeah.

195
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,491
There's been an outbreak.

196
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,739
A global pandemic
that started in South America.

197
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:34,159
R1N16. Argromoto flu.

198
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,573
It's a highly contagious airborne virus
that attacks respiratory systems.

199
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,825
From those infected
there are no survivors.

200
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,492
It's fatal and it's spreading rapidly.

201
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,496
It's only a matter of time
before it's here.

202
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:56,580
If your radio was working
you'd have heard the broadcasts.

203
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:06,827
Now, our best defense
is to make this place safe.

204
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:13,496
- Am I going too quickly for you?
- Wait, wait. What...

205
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,783
What exactly are you telling me?

206
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:20,327
I'm telling you that a highly contagious
and fatal disease is on its way here,

207
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,582
and we need to protect ourselves.

208
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,745
The official line on this from the military

209
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:34,286
is to stay inside and seal up your home
for the best chance of survival.

210
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,574
We need to start now.

211
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,240
How come you don't have it?

212
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,915
Eh? How come you don't have it?

213
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,823
I don't have it...

214
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,993
because of my airtight suit and
respirator, courtesy of the British Army.

215
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,953
I'm not fuckin' around, Martin.

216
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,492
The Army's known about this for weeks.

217
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,283
We tried to contain it,

218
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,699
but this thing's just uncontrollable.

219
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,905
So we've all been deployed
to maintain order.

220
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,492
Yeah? So where's
your fucking suit, huh?

221
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,745
When my boat sank,
it was either ditch the lot or drown.

222
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,498
Martin?

223
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,741
You don't want
your wife contracting this.

224
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,665
Believe me.

225
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,074
I don't wanna have to hurt anyone.

226
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,117
- What's going on?
- It's fine, Kate.

227
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,748
Come here.

228
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,999
Just come. Come here.

229
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,328
- Martin, you're shaking!
- He can hear.

230
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,697
He's just told me there's a disease
out there, a pandemic.

231
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,494
- It's killing everybody...
- What?!

232
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,290
He's got to seal the place up.
That's what he told me.

233
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,574
- He has to seal the house up against it.

234
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,786
- OK, enough.
- Look... Kate!

235
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,323
Hey!

236
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,915
We would know if there was a disease.

237
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,415
Doug would have come and told us.

238
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,948
Hopefully, for his sake, he's been
sealing up his house like everyone else.

239
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,198
This is bullshit.

240
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,994
This is bullshit!

241
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,244
If you want to go, go.

242
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:07,160
But do it before I seal this place up.
Once that door is shut...

243
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,198
it's not opening again.

244
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,240
He's fucking crazy.

245
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:39,408
We should just get our things and go.

246
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,414
Kate...

247
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:51,496
I have no idea what is actually
going on out there.

248
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,165
All that I know...

249
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:58,406
is that for the moment
we are stuck on this island.

250
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,905
We're surrounded by freezing water
and there's nowhere else to go.

251
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,701
I want to go home.
And I'm not staying here with him.

252
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,329
We have that.

253
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,494
We have his gun.

254
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:19,665
Now all we can do is play along
and keep him sweet

255
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,324
until I can figure out
exactly what's going on.

256
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,663
Because I don't want to see
anybody get hurt.

257
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,990
Martin!

258
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,907
Martin!

259
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,578
Morning.

260
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,911
Kettle's on if you want some tea.

261
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,749
- This is Kate of Fairweather Cottage.

262
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:53,784
Doug, this is Kate...

263
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,906
The battery works but it's not receiving
anything. I checked it last night.

264
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,325
Doug? This is Martin and Kate.
Do you read us? Over.

265
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,573
I'll need to take a look at that generator
as well because your power's out.

266
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:10,746
- Why have you barricaded the door?
- To stop people bringing the infection.

267
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:13,283
I thought it was against
the risk of a virus.

268
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,825
Everything we do here
is to minimize the risk,

269
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,993
not just of the virus
but of people trying to escape it.

270
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,746
I was gonna ask you, do you have
any weapons in the house?

271
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,325
- Hunting rifle, anything like that?
- No.

272
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,616
Anything we can use
to defend ourselves?

273
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:39,205
No, we don't have
anything like that here.

274
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,414
Then I'm gonna have to improvise.

275
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,624
Get something out of that
and give me a hand.

276
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,829
And the tinned food in the kitchen
needs organizing.

277
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,993
Martin!

278
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,905
How do you know that we haven't got it?
We've been outside.

279
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,745
You don't have it.
That fucker doesn't hang around.

280
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:18,739
- You breathe it in, you cough it out.
- That's the first symptom? A cough?

281
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,579
Uh-huh. You breathe the microbes
into your lungs,

282
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,957
they attack the host cells, which is you.

283
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,322
You cough those out and then
the rest comes out as liquid.

284
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,914
We just...

285
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,825
We need to contact our families.
We need to...

286
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,787
You said you'd fix the CB.

287
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,995
There's nothing out there
for you any more.

288
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:50,406
Now I need your help. You can start
by sorting the food in the kitchen.

289
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,448
Go fuck yourself!

290
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,703
Help me shift this against the door.

291
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,325
She's got a lot of fire
for a little thing, hasn't she?

292
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,082
Personally I like my women like that,

293
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,912
but for you it must be hard,
her being the boss.

294
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,199
Are you sure you can handle it? Yeah?

295
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,990
Martin...

296
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,786
Start on those chairs, yeah?

297
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,789
Good start.

298
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:54,745
- I'm going to try the CB.
- Knock yourself out.

299
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,499
This is Fairweather Cottage.

300
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,620
Can someone read me? Over.

301
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,620
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

302
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,953
Do you have kids?

303
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,911
Obviously not.

304
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,322
Really? I thought you and Martin
would have had them by now.

305
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,990
It's none of your business.

306
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,573
Is it me you're afraid of?

307
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,125
You don't need to be afraid, Kate.

308
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:09,160
Me and Martin
will get this place taken care of.

309
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,825
We'll seal it up
and it'll just be the three of us.

310
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,410
Like a family.

311
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,115
Kate?

312
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,829
Label it. Better get started on upstairs.

313
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,492
Shh. There are people here.

314
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,664
There's two or three of them.

315
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:47,324
When they saw the cottage
they hit the ground.

316
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:50,829
Come on. Come on.

317
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,578
Get down.

318
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:03,830
I only saw two or three but there's
probably more waiting on the shore.

319
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,786
We cannot let them in here.

320
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,993
Get down.

321
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,789
Get back.

322
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,990
Fuck.

323
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,831
They know we're here.

324
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,706
Here.

325
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,286
Pick it up.

326
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,786
Fucking pick it up, mate.

327
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,123
Martin!

328
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,493
Martin!

329
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,744
Jack, here's your gun.

330
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,323
Get down.

331
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,831
Slide it over.

332
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,082
Slide it over.

333
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,324
You're gonna take that side. Yeah?

334
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,082
Stay away from the windows. Go!

335
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,332
Martin! Take this.

336
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,283
- We're all armed in here!
- Jack!

337
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:11,450
Jack... Jack!

338
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,241
- Martin...
- Kate, get down!

339
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:23,160
They heard the shots
and they're heading for the shore.

340
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,948
They're gone?

341
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,823
For now.

342
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:33,450
There was people outside, Kate.
There was people!

343
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,331
Tell her, Jack.

344
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,199
They'll be back.

345
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,324
We have to be on our guard
from now on

346
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,331
at all times.

347
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,073
You did good.

348
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,243
Ah!

349
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,950
So your base, is it near here?

350
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,410
Yeah.

351
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,491
What's it called?

352
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,788
- The base?
- What's the base called?

353
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,748
It's called Goose Bay.

354
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,250
You're trying to figure that one out,
are you?

355
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,624
She's all fucking confused.

356
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,115
Fuck me.

357
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,620
If you're finished with your questions
I'm gonna get on.

358
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,949
That was champion.

359
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,283
How can you sit there
and not say anything?

360
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:20,907
Maybe if you could resist
antagonizing him at every opportunity...

361
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,155
What would you suggest?
What's your big fucking plan, Martin?

362
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:28,155
There are ways, Kate. But you don't
just bulldoze in every time.

363
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,325
You're right.
We should just give him the gun back,

364
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,912
just let him take over.
I don't think so!

365
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,165
We can't have her jeopardizing
our safety.

366
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,449
You do understand that, don't you?

367
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,706
We need to work together.

368
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,619
You and me. Yeah?

369
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:11,284
'Cause we can't have her
making the fucking decisions.

370
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:12,823
Yeah?

371
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,789
It's getting cold, isn't it?
I'll take a look at that generator for you.

372
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,786
But I might need a hand.

373
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,789
I can help.

374
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,411
I'd appreciate that.

375
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,743
Yeah.

376
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,074
Would you pass me
the screwdriver there?

377
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,665
- That one?
- That's the one.

378
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,244
- It's not going to work.
- What?

379
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:16,245
I said it's not... going to work.

380
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,783
- He thinks it just...
- Just needs rewiring.

381
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,823
The connection's fucked.

382
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,490
You want to get the fire going?

383
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,242
Why don't you go and do that?

384
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,157
Shine the light here.

385
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,791
- What are you trying to do, Kate?
- We fixed the generator.

386
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,324
I'm not talking about
the fucking generator.

387
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,661
I'm playing along.

388
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,323
I'm still here, Kate.

389
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,197
- There's hot water.
- Please don't fucking do this.

390
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,697
Did Martin say
you could borrow his stuff?

391
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,324
I didn't think he would mind.

392
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:24,245
- Smells good.
- Those need cutting.

393
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,119
I'm your man.

394
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:12,700
Have you been in the Army long?

395
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,582
I signed up when I was 18.

396
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,618
So that's... six, seven years.

397
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,999
Six or seven years.

398
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:26,453
I saw that scar on your arm.

399
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,287
No, that was just
a friendly disagreement, that.

400
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,119
I wondered if it was painful.

401
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,990
Are you married?

402
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,789
I was, once. Yeah.

403
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,823
No kids?

404
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,498
Didn't get the chance.

405
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,998
Why's that?

406
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,324
The disease saw to that.

407
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,498
Oh.

408
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,824
What was she like?

409
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,706
Your wife.

410
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,323
She...

411
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,241
She'd been through a lot.

412
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:43,830
Tried to put a brave face on it,
but really she was just fragile.

413
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,707
Probably deserving of a better man.

414
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,824
Slim, petite.

415
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,163
Dark skin, dark hair.

416
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,411
She was beautiful.

417
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,665
She was funny, too.

418
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,615
Sounds nice.

419
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:25,114
She was out of my league, really.

420
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,204
Oh... I wouldn't say that.

421
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,199
What are you doing?

422
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,119
Nothing. Ow.

423
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:43,409
- What were you doing?
- I was just...

424
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,741
- Oh, my God!
- Were you trying to be nice?

425
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:52,158
- You're breaking my arm.
- To get the gun?

426
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,164
Or were you just desperate?

427
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,990
How long has it been, Kate?

428
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,117
How long has it been
since he gave you what you want?

429
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:04,409
- Please... Ow!
- It's all right.

430
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,949
Just a friendly disagreement.

431
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,992
But mention my wife again
and it won't be. Understand?

432
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,573
I'm sorry.

433
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:24,825
If I really wanted
what's in your pants,

434
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,332
I'd just take it.

435
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,286
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

436
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,994
I read your little article, too.

437
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:42,120
I wouldn't leave that shit lying around
if I were you.

438
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,249
He really doesn't know you
at all, does he?

439
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,832
I need to tell you something.

440
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:03,120
I... haven't...

441
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,324
been honest with you.

442
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,453
I...

443
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,912
I stopped taking the pill.

444
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,748
That's how I got pregnant.

445
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:21,157
It wasn't an accident.

446
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:26,908
You kept saying you weren't ready.

447
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,832
I'm sorry.

448
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,746
-This is all my fault.

449
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:45,329
I'm so...

450
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,582
- I love you.
- I love you.

451
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:07,907
We'll fix this.

452
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,197
Kate and I are leaving now, Jack.

453
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,449
We're gonna risk it outside...

454
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:48,322
because we just really need
to see our families.

455
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,616
But we don't want any more trouble.

456
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:55,207
You're a fuckin' piece of work,
you, aren't you?

457
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,994
Hm?

458
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,415
Have you told him?

459
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,741
Why don't you tell Martin what I read?

460
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:09,325
He knows everything.

461
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,786
Everything.

462
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,828
I see.

463
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,453
It's over, Jack.

464
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,745
I'm just going to take
those boards down,

465
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,409
and we're gonna take our stuff
and we're gonna go.

466
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:48,749
- Please, no! Please!
- Move!

467
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:51,158
- Kate!
- Over there!

468
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,790
Get down. Down on the floor.
On your knees!

469
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,161
Go ahead.

470
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:57,998
Face on the floor.

471
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,492
Put your face on the floor.

472
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,329
Martin...

473
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:18,664
Repeat after me.
We aren't going anywhere.

474
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,994
- Say it!

475
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,824
- Say it!
- We are not going anywhere.

476
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,991
We are not... going anywhere. Please...

477
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,789
It's just the three of us.

478
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,949
- It's OK, Kate. It's OK.

479
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:36,117
- Say it.
- It's just the three of us.

480
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:39,705
- Martin...
- It's OK.

481
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,323
Please...

482
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,616
You had the chance to leave
and you didn't take it.

483
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,623
Morning.

484
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:13,989
Do you want to make me
some breakfast, sweetheart?

485
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,991
It's all ready for you.

486
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,331
Did you write in this?

487
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,948
Yeah.

488
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:41,332
A journalist and an architect.

489
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,665
"Will never forget this place.

490
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,494
"Will be back.

491
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,994
"Oh, yes, we will be back."

492
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,783
That was back in 2002.

493
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,703
- Drop it! Drop it!

494
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,744
Kate, drop it. It's OK, it's OK.

495
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:22,330
- Drop it or I'll blow his fuckin' head off!
- Don't fucking touch him!

496
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,947
Why would you do that?!
I'm just trying to be fucking civil!

497
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,825
- We know what you are!
- Yeah? Do you wanna tell me?

498
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,490
- Jack...
- Tell me what I am!

499
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,783
She's fucking scared, man!

500
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,414
For fuck's sake!

501
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,699
She's fucking scared, man.

502
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:43,826
Is it that fucking hard
for us all just to fucking get along?!

503
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,619
Is it?!

504
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,448
Out! Move!

505
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,325
- Are they dry yet?
- Yeah. Almost. Almost done, I think.

506
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,823
He's coming.

507
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,116
Quick! Stow it.

508
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,286
Both of you downstairs.

509
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,699
- What for?
- Downstairs!

510
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,619
Move!

511
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:05,823
Come on.

512
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:12,448
- Pick it up!
- Martin.

513
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:15,116
- What's wrong with him?
- Just give me a second.

514
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,749
- He's having an asthma attack.
- Just a minute.

515
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,999
- Honey, where's your inhaler?
- Bedroom.

516
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,909
- Uh-uh! We all go.

517
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,707
Give the man a fuckin' hand.

518
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:32,495
It's OK. It's OK.

519
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,328
Put your hands up!

520
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,240
Hands up where I can see 'em!

521
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,123
Put your hands up!

522
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,832
Where'd you put the inhaler?
Bathroom?

523
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,490
Stop! Wait!

524
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,823
Move.

525
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,117
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air!

526
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,328
Put your fucking hands up!

527
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,206
OK. Take the gun, Kate.

528
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,494
- What?
- Take the gun.

529
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,073
- Let go, Jack.
- Hm?

530
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,742
Let the fucking gun go.
Let it go.

531
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:30,659
- You've been outside.
- Yeah, and I saw Doug's body

532
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:33,119
- and his wife's body!
- I told you people were here.

533
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,157
- Who did that, Jack?
- I told you...

534
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:39,290
- It's empty.

535
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:40,994
OK. I got him.

536
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,456
Just come back towards me.

537
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,831
Back you come.

538
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:55,579
Keep coming. Keep going.

539
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,787
- You finally took control, then?
- Stop talking to me.

540
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:02,075
He didn't strike me as a man
with a gun, but I bet you like that.

541
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,413
- She likes a man with a gun.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

542
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,993
Huh?

543
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,786
That's not bad for an architect.

544
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,331
Just keep going.

545
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:18,953
What are you gonna do now, huh?

546
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,740
What's your big fuckin' plan?

547
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,915
You have no idea, do you?

548
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,823
You're gonna shoot me?

549
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,490
Martin.

550
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:29,623
Stop it!

551
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,449
I would fucking do it.

552
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,082
I knew you had it in you.

553
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,698
Good for you.

554
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:55,453
Good for you.

555
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,624
All right. We're going to tie him up.
Tie him.

556
01:08:59,792 --> 01:09:02,124
That's a good idea there.

557
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:05,494
- Hands behind your back.
- Turn around!

558
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,780
- You fuckin' people...
- Put your hands behind your back.

559
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,415
- You're doing a good job.
- Tie him up!

560
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,490
Martin.

561
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:27,828
- That's it.

562
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,498
That's the first symptom.

563
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:35,197
He's got it.
He's got the fucking disease.

564
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:38,290
There is no fucking disease!

565
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,116
Martin! Oh, my God!

566
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:44,998
I fuckin' told you!

567
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,288
Does that look like
fuckin' asthma to you?!

568
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:52,575
He's been outside. He's got the disease.

569
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:56,249
Get the door open, Kate.

570
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,244
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

571
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:17,409
He went outside and breathed the air
when I told him not to!

572
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,574
Jack, please, get him some help.

573
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,163
- This is all the help he's gonna need.
- You fuck! No!

574
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,823
Oh, fuck.

575
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,993
You don't want Kate
to have to see you like this.

576
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,123
I'll tell her you went quickly.

577
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,911
Yeah?

578
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,074
Won't be long till it's just the two of us.

579
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,328
He needs help.

580
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,990
We need to get him help!

581
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:34,409
Oh, yeah? You think someone out there
is gonna help us? Huh?

582
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:37,416
You go out there and it's bam! Yeah?

583
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:40,950
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

584
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,491
- He's not dying here.
- We're already dead!

585
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,164
From the moment...

586
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:34,915
- You killed him.

587
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,494
Martin... Martin.

588
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,407
Martin...

589
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:48,619
I'm gonna get us help.

590
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,579
I'm gonna find a way. OK?

591
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,492
- And we're gonna get out of here.

592
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,579
This is Fairweather Cottage.

593
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,286
Blackholme Island.

594
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:15,576
There are three people known...
to be dead,

595
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,822
and there's one ser... seriously injured.

596
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,158
This is an urgent call for help.

597
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:29,497
This is Blackholme Island,
Fairweather Cottage.

598
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,290
We need help.
There are three people known...

599
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,407
Jack.

600
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:01,906
We don't care what's out there.
We... we don't want to die here.

601
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,244
The disease isn't outside.

602
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,289
It's in here.

603
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:12,782
It's right here.

604
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:14,998
You liar!

605
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:16,664
Agh!

606
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,286
Who the fuck are you?

607
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,790
And I want the truth.

608
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,495
My husband's dying.

609
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,328
Tell me.

610
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,998
They gave me a choice.

611
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:12,741
Do time in prison,
or go to a military hospital.

612
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,830
At the hospital
they started testing these new drugs.

613
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,911
I was a lab rat.

614
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,165
They lied to me!

615
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:28,239
And they filled me full of this shit.

616
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:35,072
<i>They gave me this fatal fuckin' disease.</i>

617
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:37,994
<i>They gave it to me.</i>

618
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,958
- You escaped?
- No.

619
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,658
Then they just let me walk away.

620
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,244
They made a mistake.

621
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:53,489
They discharged me
when they shouldn't have done.

622
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:59,494
Then my wife came
by the training centre to pick me up.

623
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,825
How was I supposed to know
I was contagious?

624
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,990
I gave it to her.

625
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,998
I gave it to my wife.

626
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:25,828
I killed her.

627
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,831
Why should I believe you?

628
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,415
Did you kill Doug and his wife?

629
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:41,327
Did you?

630
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,494
They found me in their boat shed.

631
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:50,496
I had to get off the mainland
and make a crossing.

632
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:54,124
<i>I knew that I was the carrier.</i>

633
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:56,829
<i>So I made them take me out to sea.</i>

634
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,573
<i>They got it really quick.</i>

635
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,242
<i>Maybe because they were older, but...
What would you have done?</i>

636
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,658
<i>What would you have done?</i>

637
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,948
You knew we'd be infected.

638
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:12,701
You knew it wasn't outside.
It was in you.

639
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,324
You took me in.

640
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,621
<i>You took me in. I couldn't stop that.</i>

641
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:24,081
But I couldn't let you go outside and
risk infecting others. I had to contain it.

642
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,161
I had to contain me!

643
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,331
But I swear to you...

644
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,823
I never wanted to kill anyone.

645
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,661
Oh, my love...

646
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,704
It's gonna be... It's gonna be fine.

647
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:43,116
It's gonna be fine. Don't...

648
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,161
What have you done to us?

649
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,911
You knew it worked.

650
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,199
I couldn't have you contacting anyone.

651
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:56,785
<i>...members of the public. An armed
and dangerous man has escaped</i>

652
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,620
<i>from a secure military compound
in your area.</i>

653
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:03,614
<i>Private Jack Coleman was last seen
wearing green combat fatigues.</i>

654
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,329
<i>Under no circumstances
should you approach him.</i>

655
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:12,075
<i>Avoid any contact.
Report all sightings to the authorities.</i>

656
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:19,122
<i>This is a high-alert open military
broadcast to all members of the public.</i>

657
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,204
<i>- An armed and dangerous man...
- You tell them.</i>

658
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,081
I can't do that.

659
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:27,744
I can't do that.

660
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:30,954
You tell them what you've done.

661
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,698
Do it!

662
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,828
This isn't gonna bring Martin back.

663
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,491
You tell them what you've done.

664
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:08,828
This isn't gonna help us!

665
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,573
Come in. Come in. Over.

666
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:25,994
Come in. Come in. Over.

667
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:32,996
<i>This is HMS Walker.
Please identify yourself.</i>

668
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,911
<i>If you have come into contact
with Private Coleman</i>

669
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:43,665
<i>and have any symptoms of infection,</i>

670
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,074
<i>we have an antiviral vaccine.</i>

671
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:49,322
Now you believe me, that is lies.

672
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,116
They want you to hear that!
That's not true!

673
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:54,453
<i>We have a vaccine.</i>

674
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,991
No, Kate...

675
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,572
- Martin could have been saved.
- No. There is no vaccine for this.

676
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,957
They didn't even know what it is I have!

677
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:07,788
They just want to know where we are
so they can come and kill us both!

678
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,823
Please believe me.

679
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:13,950
We're never gonna leave this island.

680
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,990
We'll never leave it.
