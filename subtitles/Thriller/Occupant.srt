1
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,970
ARE YOU STALKING ME?

2
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,706
Woman: NO, I'M JUST FILMING
FOR MY WEB BLOG.

3
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,641
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
NOT FILMING ME?

4
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,842
OKAY.

5
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,580
THANKS.

6
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,148
NO PROBLEM.

7
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:52,285
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

8
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,822
I'M JUST HEADED
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

9
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,290
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME.

10
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,292
WHERE YOU HEADED?

11
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,829
WELL, IF YOU
REALLY NEED TO KNOW,

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,198
I'M ON MY WAY TO IDENTIFY
MY GRANDMOTHER'S DEAD BODY.

13
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,533
OH, WOW.

14
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:07,968
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

15
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,236
NOPE, I'M NOT.

16
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:11,238
I'M SORRY, MAN.

17
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,740
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.

18
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,943
I NEVER SAW MUCH OF HER.
SHE KEPT TO HERSELF.

19
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,344
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

20
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,346
UM, WELL, ACTUALLY,

21
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,349
I, UH...
I WORK IN HOUSEWARES

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,885
AT ED'S BARGAIN BASEMENT
ON 14th STREET.

23
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:27,487
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WORKING AT HOUSEWARES
WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE?

24
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:32,225
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
I MAJORED IN SEMIOTICS.

25
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:36,563
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO PRACTICAL USES
FOR MY DEGREE.

26
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,833
UH, SO IT'S BEEN NICE
BEING A PART OF YOUR BLOG,

27
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,569
BUT I'VE GOTTA GO I.D.
MY DEAD GRANNY NOW.

28
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,572
OH, MAN.
WELL, I'M SHARLEEN.

29
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:49,442
AND YOU SHOULD
CHECK OUT MY BLOG
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON IT.

30
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,944
SO...
(laughs)

31
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,612
WELL, I AM DANNY HILL,

32
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:55,082
AND YOU CAN FIND ME
AT ED'S BARGAIN BASEMENT...

33
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,884
IN HOUSEWARES...
IN THE BASEMENT.

34
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,053
OKAY. I'LL BE SEEING YOU,
DANNY HILL.

35
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,888
TAKE CARE.

36
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,807
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

37
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,875
I'M LILY WAINWRIGHT'S
GRANDSON.

38
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,744
THE OLD LADY IN 1003.

39
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,880
THEY'RE REMOVING
HER BODY NOW.

40
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,851
I'LL TAKE YOU.

41
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,357
(elevator dings)

42
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,663
THANKS.

43
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:51,105
DON'T WORRY ABOUT LUTHER.

44
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,108
LUTHER'S LUTHER.
HE'S BEEN HERE 40 YEARS.

45
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,310
AND ME, I HAVE BEEN HERE
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

46
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,846
IT'S GOOD BUILDING.

47
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:02,582
NO PROBLEM, NO MICE,
NO RATS, NO FUSS.

48
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,985
OH, THAT'S WEIRD.
WHAT?

49
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:09,056
I JUST COULD'VE SWORN
I SAW SOMETHING IN THE CORNER.

50
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,391
GOOD WATER PRESSURE.

51
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,462
WHEN THEY BUILT THIS,
THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING,
NOT JUST LIKE NOW.

52
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:11,118
YOU NEXT OF KIN?

53
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,786
YEAH, I WAS HER GRANDSON.

54
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,563
CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE DECEASED?

55
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:29,002
YEAH, IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER--
LILY WAINWRIGHT.

56
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:32,039
WELL, YOUR GRANDMOTHER DIED OF
A MASSIVE CARDIAC INFARCTION--

57
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,307
HEART ATTACK.

58
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,176
I'M OKAY CERTIFYING THAT
SHE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES.

59
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,311
OKAY?

60
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,578
YEAH.

61
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,862
JOE WILL HELP YOU.

62
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,173
OH, DANIEL, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

63
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,176
LIVING ROOM, DINING ROOM,

64
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:12,112
THREE BEDROOM, THREE BATHROOM.

65
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:19,186
YOU GOT MAID ROOM,
EAT-IN KITCHEN,
LAUNDRY ROOM...

66
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:21,321
BIG PLACE.

67
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:25,058
3,500 SQUARE FEET.

68
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,626
COME SIT.

69
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,866
YOU WILL NEED LAWYER.

70
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:36,870
A LAWYER?
WHY AM I GONNA NEED A LAWYER?

71
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,873
WELL, THIS PLACE
IS RENT-CONTROLLED.

72
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:43,343
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
PAID VERY LOW RENT.

73
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,145
AND YOU, YOUR FAMILY,

74
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,880
YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO THE PLACE,

75
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,548
BUT YOU WILL NEED
HELP OF LAWYER.

76
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,750
BUT I NEVER LIVED HERE.

77
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,686
I MEAN, DON'T I NEED
TO HAVE LIVED WITH A RELATIVE
BEFORE THEY DIED IN ORDER--

78
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,322
DANNY, DANNY, DANNY...

79
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:58,058
WHY YOU DO THIS?
WHY YOU MAKE TROUBLE
FOR YOURSELF?

80
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,127
YOU LIVE HERE
WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

81
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,862
BUT WHY WOULD THE LANDLORD
TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT?

82
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:05,765
HE WOULD TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT.

83
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,036
I'M DOORMAN--
THEY TRUST ME.

84
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:13,440
I HELP YOU,
YOU HELP JOE.

85
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,443
HOW MUCH WAS THE RENT?

86
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:20,180
$675.

87
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:44,338
ASHES TO ASHES,
DUST TO DUST...

88
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,940
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
DANIEL HILL.
YEAH.

89
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,810
I'M BERTRAM G. FEINBERG,
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.

90
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,246
JOE SAID YOU HAD A LANDLORD
AND TENANT PROBLEM.

91
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:59,319
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LISTEN,
DANNY, LANDLORDS HATE ME
BECAUSE I ALWAYS WIN.

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,521
YOU SEE...
(chuckles)

93
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,592
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER THE COURTS
LEAN OVER BACKWARDS IN FAVOR
OF THE TENANT.

94
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:07,594
UH, ONE COFFEE,
EXTRA SUGAR, AND A PLATTER.

95
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:11,264
UH, BAGEL,
CREAM CHEESE, COFFEE.

96
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,602
IN YOUR CASE, YOU HAVE
A DIRECT FAMILY MEMBER
WHO PASSED ON.

97
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,404
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

98
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,874
YOU MOVED IN WITH HER
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO BE WITH HER

99
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,876
DURING THE FINAL STAGES
OF HER ILLNESS,

100
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,145
WHICH ENTITLES YOU
TO TAKE OVER THE LEASE

101
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,147
UNDER THE SAME TERMS
THAT SHE ENJOYED.

102
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,149
LOOK, SHE DIED UNEXPECTEDLY
OF A HEART ATTACK.

103
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,752
NO, YOU MOVED IN WITH HER
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T COPE
FOR HERSELF--

104
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,687
AND THEN SHE HAD
THE HEART ATTACK.

105
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,490
I NEVER LIVED WITH HER.

106
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:39,292
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
YOU MOVE INTO THE APARTMENT
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

107
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,294
YOU CHANGE ALL THE LOCKS
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

108
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,497
DOUBLE--TRIPLE LOCKS.
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

109
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:46,900
OH, UH...
TRIPLE LOCKS? WHY?

110
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,737
THE LANDLORD
PROBABLY HAS COPIES
OF THE EXISTING KEYS.

111
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,707
BUT IF I TAKE OVER
THE TENANCY, LEGITIMATELY,

112
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,510
WHAT COULD THE LANDLORD
DO TO ME?

113
00:08:56,511 --> 00:09:01,981
DANNY, YOU'VE ENTERED THE WORLD
OF LANDLORD AND TENANT.

114
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:05,252
THE LANDLORD IS THE MONSTER,

115
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,389
THE GREAT BEELZEBUB,
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

116
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,126
HE WILL DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP YOU FROM TAKING OVER
A RENT-CONTROLLED LEASE.

117
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,562
NOW, ON THE OPEN MARKET,
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S APARTMENT

118
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:18,398
WOULD FETCH
$10,000 A MONTH, EASY.

119
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,968
HE'S GONNA LET YOU HAVE IT
FOR A LOUSY $675?

120
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:25,939
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE UNDER THAT KIND
OF STRESS EVERY DAY.

121
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,807
NO ONE'S EVEN ASKING YOU TO.

122
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:30,009
I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST
COUPLE OF WEEKS,

123
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,079
YEAH,
YOU GOTTA BE ON YOUR GUARD.

124
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,914
BUT THAT'S AS LONG AS IT'LL
TAKE ME TO GET A COURT ORDER.

125
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,916
NO, TODAY'S MONDAY.
AH, THANK YOU.

126
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,652
UH, LET'S SEE, I COULD GET ONE
FOR A WEEK FROM FRIDAY.

127
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,388
THAT'S 12 DAYS.

128
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,156
A COURT ORDER?

129
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:46,159
A COURT ORDER OF PROTECTION,
GRANTING YOU A NEW LEASE

130
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,195
UNDER THE SAME TERMS
AS YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S.

131
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:53,266
HOW MUCH WOULD THIS
COURT ORDER COST?

132
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:56,069
IT'S 750, YOU KNOW.

133
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,073
WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE GRIEVING,
SO 500. 500?

134
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:03,176
HALF NOW, HALF WHEN
WE GET THE COURT ORDER.

135
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,645
NOW REMEMBER,

136
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,815
DON'T LEAVE THE APARTMENT UNTIL
THE COURT ORDER COMES THROUGH.

137
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:41,981
THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF?

138
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:44,017
I LIVE AN UNCOMPLICATED LIFE.

139
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:48,688
I GOT GUY COMING
IN THE MORNING

140
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,957
TO CHANGE LOCKS
LIKE LAWYER SAID.

141
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,860
YOU ALWAYS DO
WHAT LAWYER SAY.

142
00:10:53,861 --> 00:11:00,066
MANAGING AGENT COME BY TODAY.
I TOLD HIM YOU LIVE WITH YOUR
GRANDMOTHER FOR ONE MONTH.

143
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,068
HE WAS COOL WITH THAT?

144
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,271
WHY WOULD HE NOT BE
COOL WITH THAT?

145
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,772
(glass breaks)

146
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,940
(muffled yell)

147
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,344
DON'T WORRY ABOUT 1004.

148
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,746
GOOD PEOPLE, NO PROBLEM.

149
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,947
THANKS.

150
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:22,155
YOU NEED ANYTHING,
YOU CALL JOE.

151
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,091
YOU NEED ME TO GO TO MARKET,
JOE WILL GO FOR YOU.

152
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,426
ALL RIGHT.

153
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,098
ANYTHING ELSE?

154
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,367
DON'T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.

155
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,036
I WON'T.

I HOPE YOU DON'T TURN OUT

241
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,212
SO THE DOORMAN...
HE JUST LET YOU UP?
YEAH.

242
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:28,847
BUT I DID SAY I WAS YOUR
KID SISTER FROM NEBRASKA.

243
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:30,482
YEAH, YOU'RE TOTALLY
FROM NEBRASKA.

244
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:32,584
(both laugh)

245
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,165
? I SAW YOU WITH A MADMAN ?

246
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:51,370
? RUNNING DOWN THE STREET
WITH A HOLD OF YOUR HAND ?

247
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:54,173
? I SAW YOU TURNING THE CORNER ?

248
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:58,244
? WONDERING IF I'D
EVER SEE YOU AGAIN ?

249
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:00,512
? OH, COME ON, COME ON ?

250
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:02,915
? OH, DARLING, OH, DARLING ?

251
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,285
? THE EARTH
IS SPINNING SO FAST ?

252
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:09,621
? SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR
OF YOUR APARTMENT ?

253
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:13,625
? PRAYING THAT THESE STREETS
WILL LAST ?

254
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:18,630
? YOU WERE SAILING
ACROSS THE OCEAN ?

255
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:22,134
? WATCHING THE SKY
TURNING BLACK ?

256
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:25,471
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
MUST'VE BEEN STRANGE, DUDE.

257
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:27,273
WHY'D YOU SAY THAT?

258
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:29,976
WHY WOULD SHE WANNA HIDE
ALL HER OLD FAMILY PHOTOS
IN A DRAWER?

259
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:32,178
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

260
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,085
OH, THAT'S MY MOM.

261
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,087
SHE MUST'VE BEEN
ABOUT TEN THERE.

262
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:44,223
AND THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER,
BUT I NEVER GOT TO KNOW HER.

263
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:48,227
HOW COME?
SHE SPLIT WITH MY GRANDFATHER
WHEN MY MOM WAS IN 6th GRADE,

264
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:51,964
AND HE TOOK MY MOM TO NEBRASKA,
WHERE HIS FAMILY'S FROM.

265
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:55,334
OH. FAMILIES ARE ALL
THE SAME, RIGHT?

266
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:56,835
SUPER COMPLICATED.

267
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,212
(chuckles)

268
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,447
WELL, THAT'S SMOKEY.

269
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:11,083
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF GRANDMA'S DRESS?
CAN I HAVE IT?

270
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:14,953
IT'S ALL YOURS. IT'S ALL YOURS.

271
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:16,422
? ...ALL OF MY LOVE ?

272
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,290
? OH, COME ON, COME ON ?

273
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,726
? OH, DARLING, OH, DARLING ?

274
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,096
? DON'T LET MY DREAMS
COME TRUE ?

275
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:26,265
HMM?

276
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,067
(chuckles)

277
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,270
? I'LL LET YOU GET CLOSE TO ME ?

278
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:35,007
? IF YOU JUST LET ME
GET CLOSE TO YOU ?

279
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,579
(laughs)

280
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,748

281
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:23,015
(yawns)

282
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,990
WHO ARE YOU, DANNY HILL?

283
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,996
WELL, APPARENTLY YOUR FAMILY
GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

284
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,399
AND THEY HAVE AMAZING GENES.

285
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,738
LAUNDRY ROOM.

286
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,741
LUCKY GUY.

DO YOU SEE THAT?

291
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,832
IT'S THE BEST THING
WE'VE EVER HAD ON STALK BLOG.

292
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:17,536
OH, MY GOD. HE DOESN'T PUT
THE CAP ON HIS STUFF.

293
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,071
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

294
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:26,545
(chuckles)

295
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:27,813
WHAT IS THAT?

296
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:32,918
"HELLO, I'M DANNY HILL. OH..."

297

318
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,263
THAT THE EXISTING LEASE
WOULD CONTINUE UNDER MY NAME.

319
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,733
THAT'S--NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

320
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,001
YOU SEE,
YOU ARE NOT THE LEASEHOLDER.

321
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:33,071
WHEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER DIED,
HER TENANCY ENDED

322
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:34,940
AND TECHNICALLY YOU HAVE
NO RIGHT TO BE HERE.

323
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:38,043
IN FACT, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

324
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,980
WAIT, YOU'RE--
KICKING ME OUT?

325
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,982
TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE TRESPASSING.

326
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,917
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW MY RIGHTS, SO...

327
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,052
OKAY, WELL--

328
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,187
(door locks)

329
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,360
WELL, IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANNA PLAY IT,

330
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:57,162
THEN THAT IS HOW
WE WILL PLAY IT.

331
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:01,299
SEE YOU SOON.

332
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,569
HE'S A MANAGING AGENT, DANNY.
HE'S NOT A LAWYER.

333
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,971
LOOK, I LOVE THIS APARTMENT,
MAN, AND I WANNA STAY HERE.

334
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:08,707
I COULD SEE MYSELF
LIVING HAPPILY HERE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

335
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,941
AND YOU WILL.

336
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:11,543
YEAH, BUT I NEED TO KNOW--

337
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:13,445
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY
THAT I'M GONNA GET KICKED OUT?

338
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:15,213
I MEAN,
IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE?

339
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:17,716
LISTEN, DANNY,
I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL,

340
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:19,485
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ME THAT WELL.

341
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,620
BUT I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF
GIVING A CLIENT FALSE HOPE.

342
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:24,623
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M ALREADY PAINTING THE PLACE.

343
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:28,827
SO I NEED TO KNOW THAT
NO ONE IS GONNA COME HERE
AND KICK ME OUT--NO ONE.

344
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,829
AND NO ONE WILL.
NO ONE?

345
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,698
LISTEN,
THEY WANT YOU OUT OF THERE.

346
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,366
NOW, UNTIL
I GET THE COURT ORDER,

347
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,368
YOU GOTTA BARRICADE YOURSELF
IN THERE.

348
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,103
LOCK YOURSELF IN,
LIKE I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

349
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,839
DON'T GO OUT FOR NOTHING.
NEVER.

350
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,073
YOU GOT THAT?

351
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,942
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

352
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,278
'CAUSE IF YOU GO OUT,
THAT'S IT. NO MORE APARTMENT.

353
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,347
THEY WON'T LET YOU
BACK IN THE BUILDING.

354
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:50,582
OKAY?

355
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,884
I GOTTA GO.

356
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:53,285
COFFEE, EXTRA SUGAR,
AND A PLATTER.

357
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,963
SHARLEEN?

358
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,668
SHARLEEN?

359
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,236
(door unlocking)

360
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,711
WHAT ABOUT MY ATM CARD?

361
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:56,515
JOE KEEP IT.
YOU DON'T NEED RIGHT NOW.

362
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,083
OKAY.

363
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,452
UM, HEY, JOE...

364
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:04,222
WERE YOU ON DUTY
ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT?

365
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,558
YOUR SISTER'S VERY NICE.

366
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,629
I LET HER UP BECAUSE
I KNEW IT'D MAKE YOU HAPPY.

367
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,997
SHE STAY WITH YOU?

368
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:16,902
YEAH. UH, NO, NO.

369
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:19,571
SHE, UH...
SHE HAD TO LEAVE.

370
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,475
BUT IT'S NICE
TO SEE FAMILY, NO?

371
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:28,146
YEAH, IT'S VERY NICE
TO SEE FAMILY.

372
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:32,083
BYE.

373
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,220
(locks door)

374
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,679
OH!

375
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,469
EVERYONE'S GOT A PASSWORD.

376
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:45,550
"THEY BROUGHT UNTO HIM
MANY THAT WERE POSSESSED
WITH DEVILS."

377
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:46,618
(bang)

378
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,350
(water dripping)

379
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,267
(rats squeaking)

380
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,977
SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
THERE COULD BE RATS UP HERE
ON THE 10th FLOOR?

381
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:48,847
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME THAT
THIS BUILDING DIDN'T HAVE RATS?

382
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:51,850
DANNY, TAKE IT EASY.
IT'S NEW YORK CITY.

383
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:55,587
OF COURSE
THERE'S THE ODD RAT,
WITH GARBAGE AND COOKING.

384
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,589
I'VE GOT MAN.
HE COMES EVERY MONDAY.

385
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,990
HE WILL TAKE CARE
OF PROBLEM.

386
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,993
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

387
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:05,997
HOW DO I KNOW THAT THE LANDLORD
HASN'T PAID YOU TO TRICK ME,

388
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:10,001
GET SOME GOON DISGUISED
AS A BUG GUY TO COME IN HERE
AND KICK ME OUT OF MY APARTMENT?

389
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:13,471
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, JOE,
YOU WORK FOR THEM--
YOU DON'T WORK FOR ME.

390
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:15,140
THAT IS WHAT YOU SAY TO JOE?

391
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:18,343
THAT IS WHAT YOU SAY TO ME?!
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS!

392
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:19,878
(sighs)

393
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,080
I ENCOURAGE YOU
TO LIVE IN MY BUILDING

394
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:23,448
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU.

395
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,983
BUT MAYBE--
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

396
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:26,985
MAYBE I LET YOU STEW IN THERE!
HAVE THEM KICK YOU OUT!

397
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:29,921
NO, NO, JOE, JOE,
LOOK, I'M...

398
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,990
I'M SORRY.

399
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:34,993
I JUST THINK I'M GETTING
A LITTLE PARANOID BEING
COOPED UP HERE ALL THE TIME.

400
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:38,596
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU BRING THAT BUG GUY,
I'LL LET YOU BOTH IN, OKAY?

401
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:41,066
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S BETTER.

402
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:44,402
AND, UH, ACTUALLY...

403
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:49,007
I NEED YOU TO GO OUT
AND GET ME SOME GROCERIES
AND STUFF.

404
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:51,476
YOU NEED? NOW YOU NEED JOE?
YOU NEED YOUR BEST FRIEND JOE.

405
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,878
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME NOW?

406
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,480
YEAH, I SLID THE LIST
UNDER THE DOOR.

407
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,319
(sighs)

408
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,721
EIGHT SIX-PACK OF MODELO.

409
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,456
WHAT, YOU WANT TO KILL JOE?
NO, IT'S TOO HEAVY.

410
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,458
I BRING SIX SIX-PACK.

411
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,060
TWO GALLON OF MILK.

412
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:10,461
I BRING ONE.
I HAVE BAD BACK.

413
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,331
TWO PERCENT.
ALL RIGHT, RELAX!

414
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,867
TWO PERCENT.
NO PROBLEM.

415
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:18,469
FOUR PINT PHISH FOOD,
FOUR FROZEN TACO,

416
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,338
EIGHT FROZEN
ROAST BEEF DINNER.

417
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,473
THAT'S TOO MUCH BEEF, BUDDY.

418
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:25,343
I BRING BEEF AND CHICKEN,
50/50. BETTER FOR YOU. OKAY?

419
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,478
ALL RIGHT, JOE.

420
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,947
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

421
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:30,348
ALL RIGHT.

422
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:40,658
(rats squeaking)

423
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:02,981
(sighs)

424
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:28,866
Feinberg: THEY'VE TAKEN OUT
A COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU,

425
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,868
SEEKING AN ORDER FOR
IMMEDIATE POSSESSION,

426
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,870
AND IT'S TO BE
ENTIRELY EXPECTED.

427
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,073
BUT YOU ASSURED ME THAT
THE APARTMENT WAS MINE.

428
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,607
AND IT WILL BE.

429
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,243
I ALREADY GOT
A HEARING DATE

430
00:40:38,244 --> 00:40:41,246
AT LANDLORD AND TENANT COURT
NEXT TUESDAY.

431
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:44,249
LOOK, MAN,
THAT IS A REALLY LONG TIME
TO BE HOLED UP IN HERE.

432
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,451
I'M STARTING TO GO
A LITTLE CRAZY, ALL RIGHT?

433
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,986
OKAY, JUST BE PATIENT.

434
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,521
YOU GOTTA REMAIN THERE
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME.

435
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:52,257
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH IT.

436
00:40:52,258 --> 00:40:54,926
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

437
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,061
TRUST ME.

438
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:57,728
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

439
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:16,281
CAN I HAVE A BITE?

440
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,415
Sharleen: DO YOU WANT ONE?

441
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,549
CAN I HAVE A BITE?

442
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,985
SURE, GO AHEAD.

443
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:22,087
IT'S SO GOOD.
IT'S BRILLIANT.

444
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:29,660
(humming)

445
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,131
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

446
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:35,533
UM, CAN I GET IN IT?

447
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,002
UH, DRIVE IT?

448
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:39,471
OH, SHIT.
I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL.

449
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,040
BUT I CAN GET YOU
ON MY VIDEO BLOG.

450
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,711
CAN I HAVE A RIDE
ON YOUR VESPA?

451
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,915
GO DOWN THERE.

452
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,717
?

453
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,552
(laughs)

454
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:05,863
ARE YOU STALKING ME?

455
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,999
NO, I'M JUST FILMING
FOR MY WEB BLOG.

456
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,201
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
NOT FILMING ME?

457
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:11,336
OKAY.

458
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:12,803
THANKS.

459
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,010
(heavy breathing)

460
00:42:43,502 --> 00:42:45,636
(chuckles)

461
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:46,837
WHAT IS THAT?

462
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:51,109
"HELLO, I'M DANNY HILL. OH..."

463
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:00,251
(gasps)

464
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:57,108
(doorbell rings)

465
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:07,852
(doorbell rings)

466
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,457
YEAH?

467
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,724
CABLE.

468
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:16,461
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY CABLE.

469
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:18,363
SAYS HERE YOU DID.

470
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,700
LOOK, I'M SURE
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY CABLE.

471
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:46,224
(doorbell rings)

472
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:53,798
NOW WHAT?

473
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:56,734
YEAH?

474
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,002
Man: PIZZA DELIVERY.

475
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:00,205
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY PIZZA.

476
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:02,807
WELL, I GOT A PEPPERONI
AND MUSHROOM HERE.

477
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:04,942
I DIDN'T ORDER A FUCKING PIZZA.

478
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:07,978
SO WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE?

479
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:11,182
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

480
00:45:11,183 --> 00:45:14,452
YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA WIN,
OKAY?

481
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,127
PIZZA DELIVERY.

482
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,006
YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP YOUR COOL.

483
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,009
YOU CAN DO THAT.

484
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,878
YOU KNOW YOU CAN.

485
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:19,284
AND THEN THIS BABY
IS GONNA BE ALL YOURS.

486
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:22,887
YOU JUST HAVE
A COUPLE MORE DAYS

487
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:25,556
AND THEN YOU CAN
GET OUT OF HERE.

488
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:29,160
NOBODY CAN STOP YOU
FROM COMING BACK IN...

489
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,297
BECAUSE THIS
WILL BE YOUR HOME.

490
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,901
OKAY?

491
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,308
YEAH.

492
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:59,256
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
I'VE TRIED TO GET HOLD OF HIM.

493
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:02,727
Woman: I'M SORRY,
BUT MR. FEINBERG'S
AT WORK RIGHT NOW.

494
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:05,463
THAT'S--SEE, THAT'S WHAT YOU
TOLD ME YESTERDAY.

495
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:08,599
LOOK, JUST PUT ME THROUGH
TO ONE OF HIS PARTNERS.

496
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,803
MR. FEINBERG
DOESN'T HAVE PARTNERS.
MR. FEINBERG WORKS ALONE.

497
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:13,338
I CAN GIVE YOU
HIS VOICE MAIL.

498
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:16,307
NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT HIS VOICE MAIL!

499
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:17,375
(man screams)

500
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,479
(woman screams)

501
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,084
(people clamoring)

502
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,953
QUICK! GET SOME HELP!

503
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,231
(doorbell rings)

504
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:43,634
(knock at door)

505
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,378
JOE GOT YOUR STUFF FOR YOU.

506
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,314
BUT NOW I MUST GO
TALK TO THE POLICE.

507
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:58,916
WHAT HAPPENED?

508
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:03,254
THE PAINTERS, THEY'RE GOOD,
BUT THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION.

509
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,124
EXTERMINATOR
WILL BE HERE 9:00 AM.

510
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,993
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

511
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:36,687
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE SPRAYING
THAT NASTY SHIT.

512
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,742
ZIG?

513
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:24,629
(rats squeaking)

514
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:53,724
(grunts)

515
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:17,514
Joe: WHAT'S UP, JOHNNY BABY?

516
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:20,585
WHERE DO I START
THIS MORNING?

517
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:21,719
1003.

518
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,694
EXTERMINATOR.

519
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,070
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE?

520
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,472
DEPENDS.

521
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:45,776
YOU GOTTA A PRETTY BIG SPACE...
GIVE ME ABOUT AN HOUR.

522
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,747
(whistling)

523
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:24,849
(humming)

524
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,573
(Ziggy meows)

525
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:51,842
OH.

526
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:53,144
(Ziggy meows)

527
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:54,545
HEY, KITTY.

528
00:53:03,188 --> 00:53:05,923
KITTY...
(chuckles)

529
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:10,661
(sprays)

530
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:12,296
(Ziggy growls)

531
00:53:20,638 --> 00:53:24,508
DANNY BABY, IT'S JOE.
EXTERMINATOR STILL WITH YOU?

532
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,977
UH, I'LL CHECK
AND CALL YOU BACK.

533
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,982
HELLO?

534
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:36,420
(gasps)

535
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:48,465
OH! OH! OH! OH!

536
00:53:54,906 --> 00:53:56,006
FUCK!

537
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,920
JOE?

538
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,922
YES, BABY?

539
00:54:11,923 --> 00:54:14,725
HI, UH...

540
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:17,928
IT'S--IT'S DANNY
IN--IN 1003.

541
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:20,330
LISTEN, UM...

542
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:22,332
I JUST...

543
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:25,602
I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT...

544
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:30,040
THE EXTERMINATOR
LEFT A WHILE AGO.

545
00:54:31,243 --> 00:54:32,843
DON'T WORRY, BABY.

546
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:35,379
JOHNNY MOVE THROUGH BUILDING
LIKE BURMESE PYTHON.

547
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,249
HE DO GOOD JOB FOR YOU, NO?

548
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,252
YES, HE DID A GOOD JOB.

549
00:54:41,253 --> 00:54:43,387
HE DID A GREAT JOB.

550
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:53,063
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

551
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:57,201
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,
THE COPS WILL COME

552
00:54:57,202 --> 00:55:01,538
AND THEN THE LANDLORD
AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINER.

553
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,607
AND WHILE THEY DRAG ME DOWN
TO THE PRECINCT,

554
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:07,711
THEY'RE GONNA BE IN HERE,
CHANGING LOCKS AND KICKING ME
OUT OF MY HOME!

555
00:55:07,712 --> 00:55:09,680
NO...

556
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,581
YOU HAVE GOT TO GO.

557
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,619
(panting)

558
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,995
(panting)

559
00:55:24,996 --> 00:55:26,563
FUCK!

560
00:55:44,816 --> 00:55:45,850
(grunting)

561
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,736
(grunting)

562
00:56:11,476 --> 00:56:12,843
(elevator dings)

563
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:16,080
(panting)

564
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:20,384
(gasps)

565
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,629
WELL, HEY THERE AGAIN!

566
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,332
FANCY RUNNING INTO YOU
TWICE THE SAME DAY.

567
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,068
YOU DON'T RUN INTO NEIGHBORS
THAT OFTEN IN THIS BUILDING.

568
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:40,304
I'M SORRY...
WE MET BEFORE?

569
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:42,506
THIS MORNING
OF COURSE.

570
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:50,447
WE'VE BEEN AWAY.
MY DAD AND I JUST CAME BACK
FROM VISITING RELATIVES UPSTATE.

571
00:56:51,682 --> 00:56:53,884
I ALWAYS LIKED
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

572
00:56:53,885 --> 00:56:55,552
NICE LADY.

573
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:59,056
NOW ISN'T THAT SMART?

574
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:02,059
THOSE GLOVES.

575
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,860
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA PICK UP THESE DAYS.

576
00:57:03,861 --> 00:57:08,198
YEAH. WELL, VERY NICE
MEETING YOU, NEIGHBOR...

577
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,666
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

578
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:14,405
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
JUST LET US KNOW.

579
00:57:14,406 --> 00:57:16,206
THAT'S WHAT
NEIGHBORS ARE FOR.

580
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,291
AHH.

581
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,226
(panting)

582
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:57,314
DANNY BABY,
YOU MISS EVERYTHING.

583
00:57:57,315 --> 00:57:59,116
FIRST MY PAINTER...

584
00:57:59,117 --> 00:58:00,250

586
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,588
MASSIVE HEART ATTACK.

587
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:06,156
AWFUL.
YEAH.

588
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:10,560
THE PARAMEDICS,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY FIND
IN HIS POCKET?

589
00:58:13,598 --> 00:58:17,201
LITTLE BOTTLE OF PILLS
FOR BLOOD PRESSURE.

590
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,668
(mumbles)
WHAT?

591
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:20,337
(mumbles)
ALL RIGHT, HE'S DEAD.

592
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:22,306
NOW I NEED TO GO.

593
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:25,075

TO DEAL WITH RATS IN BUILDING.

594
00:58:25,076 --> 00:58:26,743
(mumbles)

595
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,283
THANK YOU.

596
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:14,258
(grunting)

597
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:35,712
OH.

598
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:37,047
(chuckles)

599
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:50,227
ZIG.

600
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,967
(sighs)

601
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,048
ZIG?

602
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,823
ZIG?

603
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:55,259
(snaps fingers)

604
01:00:56,494 --> 01:00:57,694
ZIGGY?

605
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:11,908
ZIGGY?

606
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:15,078
COME ON, BUDDY.

607
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,146
ZIGGY?

608
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:24,087
(bell ringing)

609
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,191
(gasps)

610
01:01:27,192 --> 01:01:28,458
ZIGGY?!

611
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:31,728
ZIGGY?! ZIGGY?!

612
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,532
(scratching sound)

613
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:37,534
ZIGGY?

614
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:41,238
(grunting)

615
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:58,488
(doorbell rings)

616
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:05,495
(doorbelling ringing
and knocking)

617
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:16,707
WHAT IN HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?

618
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,375
IMPROVEMENTS.

619
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:19,843
DO YOU HAVE
THE BUILDING'S APPROVAL?

620
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:21,645
UH...

621
01:02:21,646 --> 01:02:22,846
I AM CALLING THE POLICE.

622
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:24,448
DAD, CALM DOWN!

623
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,782
I AM CALLING THE POLICE!

624
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,152
I AM NOT GONNA CALM DOWN

625
01:02:29,153 --> 01:02:32,422
HELLO AGAIN.
NEED SOME HELP IN THERE?

626
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:36,660
WILL YOU SHUT UP?!
GET BACK IN THE APARTMENT!

627
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:40,397
IF YOU KEEP MAKING THAT NOISE,
I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

628
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:45,101
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IN THERE,
BUT THIS BUILDING HAS RULES!

629
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:08,158
THAT'S FUNNY.

630
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,895
YEAH, THAT'S FUCKING HILARIOUS.

631
01:03:11,896 --> 01:03:14,898
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA WIN,
BUT NO.

632
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:16,300
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN.

633
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,077
JOE HERE.

634
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:03,613
YOU WANT WHAT?

635
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:10,354
WHATEVER YOU NEED, BABY.
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

636
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:15,459
(door unlocking)

637
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,162
YOU'RE IN LUCK, BABY.

638
01:04:19,163 --> 01:04:21,565
RAZOR WIRE
AND RAZOR CUTTERS.

639
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,032
CAREFUL, VERY SHARP.

640
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,034
THEY CUT OFF MY POWER.

641
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:27,571
WHY YOU TALKING CRAZY?

642
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,239
CRAZY?

643
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,108
LOOK.

644
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:37,381
NO, NO, NO...

645
01:04:37,382 --> 01:04:39,716
THEY ARE FUCKING
WITH MY HEAD, JOE.

646
01:04:39,717 --> 01:04:41,385
THEY TOOK MY CAT!

647
01:04:41,386 --> 01:04:45,188
POWER IS ON
AND YOUR CAT PROBABLY
HIDING IN THE APARTMENT.

648
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:49,125
NO, JOE, THEY CUT MY POWER.
I KNOW THEY DID!

649
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,061
I TELL YOU WHAT WE DO.

650
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:54,130
I TAKE ATM CARD,
GET YOU NICE DINNER

651
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:56,165
AND NICE BOTTLE OF WINE
SO YOU CAN RELAX.

652
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,735
I CAN'T RELAX!

653
01:04:58,736 --> 01:05:00,537
WHY YOU HAVE ALL THIS STUFF?

654
01:05:00,538 --> 01:05:02,138
TO KEEP THEM
FROM ENTERING MY APARTMENT.

655
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,673
THEM?
YES.

656
01:05:03,674 --> 01:05:05,074
WHO'S THEM, DANNY?

657
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:07,411
NOT LANDLORD. DOOR'S LOCKED.
HE CANNOT GET IN.

658
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:09,880
WELL, THAT IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT STOPPING HIM, IS IT?

659
01:05:09,881 --> 01:05:11,648
THEY ARE MESSING WITH ME, JOE.

660
01:05:11,649 --> 01:05:14,684
THEY ARE TRYING TO DRIVE ME
OUT OF MY HOME!

661
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:18,555
WHAT DID LAWYER SAY?
HOW MANY DAYS BEFORE HE KNOWS?

662
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,292
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

663
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,131
DAY AFTER TOMORROW, DANNY.

664
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:54,784
JOE?

665
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:56,586
WHAT?

666
01:06:56,587 --> 01:06:59,355
I NEED YOU TO GET UP HERE
RIGHT NOW.

667
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:06,663
(doorbell rings)

668
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:15,605
Man: I'VE BEEN TOLD
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

669
01:07:15,606 --> 01:07:17,674
WHERE'S JOE?
HE WENT HOME.

670
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:19,009
I CALLED FOR JOE.

671
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,178
JOE IS SICK.
I'M FILLING IN FOR HIM.

672
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:23,847
YOU'RE FILLING IN FOR HIM?

673
01:07:23,848 --> 01:07:25,582
UM...

674
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,017
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

675
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:29,318
YOU KNOW...

676
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:31,521
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK,
YOU AND ME.

677
01:07:31,522 --> 01:07:33,089
UM... ALL RIGHT.

678
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,860
FIRST I NEED YOU
TO GO TO THE MARKET
AND GET ME SOME STUFF.

679
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:39,362
I'M PUTTING A NOTE
UNDER THE DOOR.

680
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:43,800
I'M UNDER STRICT INSTRUCTIONS
TO ASK YOU TO OPEN THE DOOR

681
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:46,302
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING
IMMEDIATELY, SIR.

682
01:07:47,638 --> 01:07:49,305
WELL, ALL RIGHT...

683
01:07:49,306 --> 01:07:52,576
WELL, FUCK YOU
AND YOUR FANCY NEW HAT,

684
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:54,744
BECAUSE THIS IS MY HOME
AND I'M ENTITLED TO BE HERE!

685
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,494
ONE MORE DAY.

686
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:55,932
ONE MORE DAY...

687
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:01,571
AND THIS PLACE WILL BE
ALL FUCKING MINE.

688
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,841
(echo) AND THIS PLACE WILL BE
ALL FUCKING MINE.

689
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:37,867
(screaming)

690
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,077
(doorbell rings)

691
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:52,015
YEAH?

692
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,818
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
IN THERE, SIR?

693
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:56,419
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE,
OFFICER.

694
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,922
MIND IF I TAKE
A LOOK FOR MYSELF?

695
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:02,125
Stanley: YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU
I'D CALL THE POLICE.

696
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:06,395
WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU
IN THIS BUILDING.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

697
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:08,097
CAN I COME IN?
DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT?

698
01:12:08,098 --> 01:12:10,566
NO.
NO? THEN YOU CAN'T COME IN.

699
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:12,302
YOU SEE?
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

700
01:12:12,303 --> 01:12:14,337
YOU'RE DEALING WITH
A COMPLETE WHACKO.

701
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,638
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

702
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:23,579
DINNER.

703
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,683
I WORK...
ODD HOURS.

704
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:30,153
IT'S AFTER 10:00 PM.
KEEP THAT RACKET DOWN.

705
01:12:30,154 --> 01:12:34,357
IF I GET ANOTHER COMPLAINT,
I'LL COME BACK HERE WITH
A WARRANT. YOU UNDERSTAND?

706
01:12:57,814 --> 01:12:59,415
ZIGGY!

707
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:56,940
Woman: YOU HAVE REACHED
