Great tune.

25
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,493
That was a request from
my mom back in England.

26
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:36,373
And this is Richard Blaine
on KSLM.

27
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,453
Let's go to the phones again
here on the Blaine Line.

28
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,404
Give us a call with
your personal problems,

29
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,060
predictions, and political beefs.

30
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:45,364
Hello, you're on the air.

31
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,093
Uh, we'll get back to you.

32
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,396
Now, let's go to our next
caller here at KSLM.

33
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,612
Hello, you're on the air.

34
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:52,341
It's Cletus, man.
I'm in trouble again.

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,580
Oh, no, not you Cletus.
What's wrong now?

36
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:56,116
Man, I'm in the county jail.

37
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,268
So, what happened, Cletus?

38
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,548
There was this chick, all right.

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,724
She was unbelievable. She was
on the corner at Sunset.

40
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,036
So, what is it you need, Cletus?

41
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,188
Give me some advice, Blaine.

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,948
I need someone to get
me out of here, man.

43
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,805
Cletus, you're a lucky man.

44
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:10,292
Because I got this friend who plays
a mean guitar and he's studying law

45
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,212
and right now he's in county jail.

46
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:15,285
So, look for Pete, Cell 47.
He can get anyone out.

47
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,372
Wait, what's his name?

48
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm sorry, Cletus,
we're out of time.

49
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:18,900
This is my only call, man.

50
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,820
Next caller, please.
Hello, you're on the air.

51
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:22,740
Hello?

52
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,493
Hold it, hold it, this isn't me.

53
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:28,436
Did I fool you? This is
an answering machine.

54
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,100
Pretty nifty, huh?

55
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,020
So, if you'll wait for the tone

56
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,748
I'll be happy to
pass it along to Drood

57
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,236
whenever he comes home or
wakes up or whatever he does.

58
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:39,380
Are you ready?

59
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,708
Drood, pick up the phone.

60
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,932
I know you're there.

61
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,164
Pick up the phone, Drood.

62
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,188
Shit!

63
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,964
Helen.

64
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:02,132
Look, how many times do I
ask you to do me a favor?

65
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:03,285
I'm out the door.

66
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:04,820
No, no, forget it, forget it.

67
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,004
I took her to school already.

68
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:08,372
Jeez, listen,
I was up all night.

69
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:09,909
I don't even want
to hear about this.

70
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,020
This is exactly the kind of
thing I talked to you about.

71
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,204
I know.

72
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,669
And I was late.

73
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:21,077
I don't know what
to say. I gotta go.

74
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,516
Helen, I...

75
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:29,684
Hello.

76
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:31,796
Drood, this is Wilson.

77
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,644
Where is Drood's World?

78
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,308
Hold it, this isn't me.

79
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,068
It's my answering machine.

80
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,413
Shit!

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,685
Did I fool you?

82
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,108
Drood is unable to come
to the phone right now,

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,053
but if you'd like to leave
a nice little message,

84
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,804
just wait for the tone.

85
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,676
It's deadline time.
Pick up the phone.

86
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,268
I've got better things to do

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,636
than chase after you
all the time.

88
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,852
Drood...

89
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,084
Drood, if it isn't in my
hands by 4:00, you're fired.

90
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,108
Asshole.

91
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:19,828
Hi.

92
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,493
You sold it?

93
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:32,212
I can't believe it.
You sold it?

94
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,708
You're very hot in certain
circles right now, young man.

95
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,180
Thanks to me.

96
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,764
Jimbo, this is $500.

97
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,428
Whoa! Stop!

98
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,637
Whoo! This is
a silk shirt.

99
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,396
And a great tie. Who?

100
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,125
Look, the guy...
Who?

101
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:49,524
The guy was real tasteful, okay?

102
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:52,629
He had dark glasses
and a white stick.

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,316
What do you care,
I sold it, didn't I?

104
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,437
Hey, Bean!

105
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:16,916
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.

106
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,932
Listen, I'm sorry
about this morning.

107
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,660
Are you taking me to your house?

108
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,476
No, honey, I just stopped
by to say hello.

109
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,172
Listen, what were you
doing over there?

110
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,316
Beating up a boy. Feel my muscle.

111
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,740
Let's see.
That is excellent.

112
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,852
Hello.
May I help you?

113
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,548
I was just saying hello
to the kid.

114
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,492
I'm her father.

115
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,364
My name is Charles Drood.
We haven't met.

116
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,596
I'm Margaret Bell,
Elizabeth's teacher.

117
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:52,340
Who? Oh, oh, Elizabeth, right.
We call her Bean.

118
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,844
Drood, show her your teeth.

119
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,444
You must be new here.

120
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,940
Do the teeth thing,
Daddy, please.

121
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,916
Aw, honey, I don't think Miss
Bell really wants to be bothered.

122
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:02,676
Missus.
Huh?

123
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,372
Mrs. Bell.

124
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,964
And, actually, I'd like
to see this teeth thing.

125
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,332
I lost them in a fight.

126
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:26,708
Your back teeth?

127
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,948
Daddy likes to tell stories.

128
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,284
Mommy says he tells
stories all the time.

129
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:39,572
Blaine Line,
let's go to our next call.

130
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:40,852
Hello, you're on the air.

131
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,004
You've got to help me.

132
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:44,212
I'm calling from a pit
where my house used to be.

133
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:45,844
Um, excuse me.
What's your name, sir?

134
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,700
My name's Ethan
and you got to help me.

135
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,452
This UFO thing, look
like a big Buick hubcap,

136
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:52,532
come down, sucked up
my furniture with,

137
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:54,388
I don't know, some sort
of hose or something.

138
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,732
Sucked up everything.

139
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,652
I went to get
the bowling trophies,

140
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,892
you know, it's important for me
to get the bowling trophies,

141
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:00,948
and you're not
going to believe it,

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,348
I come back
and my family was gone.

143
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:04,948
What?

144
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,580
Bad move, Ethan.
Sucked up the hose.

145
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:21,620
Hi, Drood!

146
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,252
Oh, my God!

147
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,140
Drood!

148
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,140
That didn't hurt.

149
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:43,540
Arrest that kid.

150
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,332
Would you grow up.
Children, please.

151
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,340
How do you do it?

152
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,292
Do what?

153
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,500
Well, you walk in and
everything falls apart.

154
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,572
Helen, I got hit in the nuts
with a fucking rubber chicken.

155
00:08:58,612 --> 00:08:59,892
Right, laugh.

156
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,044
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,644
I gotta sit down.

158
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,236
Oh, come on.

159
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,028
What are you doing here, Drood?

160
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,716
I just...

161
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,884
Helen, what do you think about
you and I getting back together?

162
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,036
Yeah, I need...
I need a hand, yeah.

163
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,828
So, which hand
would you like, sir.

164
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,012
Listen, now, don't fool around.

165
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:54,132
I'm trying to make a chicken.

166
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,796
So, you're...
You're into chickens?

167
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,852
No, no.

168
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:58,708
Oh, you're cooking, I'm sorry.

169
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,084
Is this chicken fully dressed?

170
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,364
I don't know,
if feathers count as a...

171
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,116
God!

172
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,396
Mr. Drood?

173
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,796
My card.

174
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,964
Come here.

175
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,555
Come here.
Come here.

176
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,020
Come here.

177
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,195
It's okay.

178
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,427
Where is it,
Mr. Drood?

179
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,148
Where's what?

180
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,508
You got to tell us, okay?

181
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,907
Okay?

182
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,475
I don't know what
you're talking about.

183
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:04,468
Aw!

184
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,244
Where is it?

185
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,228
You got the wrong guy here.

186
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,868
She gave you something.

187
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,980
Who?

188
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,283
- Who?
- Who?

189
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,916
Fuck this.

190
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,259
Let me get back there.

191
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,884
It'll be just a few minutes, Mr.
Drood.

192
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,140
Thank you.

193
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,796
Anybody tell you to move?

194
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:40,916
I'm not...

195
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,388
Sit over here.

196
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:08,979
Look, I think...

197
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,644
Listen, I'm not
supposed to be...

198
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,828
No one is.

199
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,171
Look, I just...

200
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:16,436
You're making a big mistake.

201
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:24,820
I'm going to kill every
fucking guy in here.

202
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,596
You fuck my wife?

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,220
What's her name?

204
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,820
Oh, no.
Oh, please, no, don't.

205
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,939
Hold it.
Wait a second.

206
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:00,148
Hey, hey.
Hey!

207
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:02,004
Which one of you guys
is Charles Drood?

208
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:04,596
I am.

209
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:11,091
So, you never saw either one
of these men before, huh?

210
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:12,084
Nope.

211
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,932
And if you saw them again do you
think you could identify them?

212
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,627
Yeah, maybe.

213
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,859
Listen, I don't know.

214
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:30,643
They didn't take
anything, right?

215
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,211
Nope, nothing.

216
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,900
And you don't know
what they were after.

217
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:43,604
That it?

218
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,660
Not quite, Mr. Drood.

219
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:49,812
You see, your kidnapping
may be connected to a case

220
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,028
that we're investigating here

221
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,035
in which you may be
considered a suspect.

222
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,124
A suspect for what?

223
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,724
Well, I have to advise you

224
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,227
that you have a right
to remain silent

225
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,435
and have the services
of a lawyer

226
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:05,844
but if you haven't
done anything wrong,

227
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:06,931
you've got nothing
to worry about,

228
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:09,332
and I can get you out of
here a hell of a lot sooner.

229
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,740
I don't need a lawyer.

230
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:13,395
All right.

231
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:18,803
What can you tell me about a
girl named Yolanda Caldwell?

232
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,292
Nothing.

233
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,675
Nothing.

234
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,140
We just found her body today, Mr.
Drood.

235
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,932
You're supposed to say
you love me now.

236
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,899
"I would characterize
the relationship

237
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,812
"as primarily sexual
as I knew...

238
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,516
"...as I never knew very
much about her private life

239
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,755
"outside of our relationship.

240
00:18:56,788 --> 00:19:00,020
"Her marital status, place of
birth, friends, etcetera."

241
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,156
Right.

242
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,884
Weren't you curious?

243
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,299
She wouldn't tell me.

244
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:13,972
"The last time I saw her

245
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,571
"we had agreed to
go away together."

246
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,868
No, I said that I would
meet her there, I...

247
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,283
I didn't exactly say

248
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,203
that I would go away with her.

249
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,011
"I never went
to the station."

250
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,235
And why not?

251
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,219
I don't know.

252
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,323
I didn't go. I got a
wife, I've got a kid.

253
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,828
I just didn't go, okay?

254
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,483
Okay, okay.
Let's go over it again.

255
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,435
Frank.

256
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,339
"I met Yolanda Caldwell
at a party

257
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:57,907
"in a West Hollywood dance club

258
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:02,228
"run by a friend
named James Campbell."

259
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,059
Hello there, darling,
fancy a little dance?

260
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,227
Yes.

261
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,203
Excuse me.

262
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,763
Excuse me.

263
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,747
Is that one of
those trick lighters?

264
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:58,739
No.

265
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,116
Is that a wedding ring?

266
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,251
You ask a lot of questions.

267
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:14,451
I never met a woman
with a gun before.

268
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,715
Were you in love
with her Mr. Drood?

269
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,331
You still haven't
answered me, Mr. Drood.

270
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,771
Did you love her?

271
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,947
I don't know.

272
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,835
I don't know what that means.

273
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:03,892
Ah!

274
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,355
Mr. Drood!

275
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:21,587
Yeah.

276
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:25,171
Listen, Mrs. Raines.

277
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:27,699
I'm probably
gonna be moving from here.

278
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:31,827
What?

279
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,180
Where's your hearing aid?

280
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,147
What?

281
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,435
I'll talk to you later.

282
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:47,956
Oh, Mr. Drood!

283
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,075
What?

284
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:50,771
What?

285
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,307
Your envelope!

286
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,204
I've written
a letter of complaint

287
00:22:57,235 --> 00:23:00,436
to the postal service
in Washington, D.C.

288
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,123
I didn't want to send it
locally because I'm sure that

289
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:06,867
our mailman's superiors are part
and parcel of the conspiracy.

290
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,227
I can't go back.

291
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,795
What conspiracy?

292
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,299
Mr. Drood,

293
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,763
you look terrible.

294
00:23:24,723 --> 00:23:26,643
What conspiracy?

295
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,467
To lose our mail.

296
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:32,339
Haven't you noticed
anything missing?

297
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:47,027
Okay.

298
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,043
Go to the window.

299
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,675
Go to the window!

300
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,395
Turn around.

301
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,667
Close the blinds.

302
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,299
Get down on your knees.

303
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:19,827
Come on.

304
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:26,899
You don't have to do this.
I promise you...

305
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:28,147
Shut up.

306
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:37,939
She thought you were so smart.

307
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:52,147
Okay, let's see
how smart you are.

308
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,131
Okay?

309
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,347
Right.

310
00:25:56,947 --> 00:26:00,147
You got an envelope
like this? Yes?

311
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:02,995
Go get it.
Go get it!

312
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,947
Fast, quick!
Come on!

313
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:13,395
Put it down on the table.

314
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,755
Put that inside.

315
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:21,299
Don't look at it.
Just put it inside.

316
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:44,370
That's very good.

317
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,667
You just forget this.

318
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,675
I'm doing you a big favor here.

319
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,867
Hey! Hey!
What, are you crazy?

320
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,587
What!

321
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:48,083
Give me the lighter. Give me...
Give me the lighter!

322
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:53,619
You are nuts.

323
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:54,803
Why can't you say it?

324
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:56,659
Give me the lighter.

325
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,323
So damn guarded.

326
00:27:58,355 --> 00:28:01,267
Me? What about you?

327
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,299
I have to be.

328
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:12,435
Why?

329
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,027
What could be so terrible?

330
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:41,811
You'll be there?

331
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,314
I said I would.

332
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:47,283
You'll really be there?

333
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:48,787
I'll be there.

334
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,114
Daddy!
Hmm.

335
00:29:12,147 --> 00:29:13,715
Am I going high?

336
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,795
Real high, baby.

337
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,587
Come on, let's
go play in the sand.

338
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:27,539
Let's go play in the sand.

339
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:28,979
Okay.

340
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,058
Drood?

341
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,627
You all right?
Yeah.

342
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,259
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm...

343
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:45,203
You're sure? Was off some place.
Yeah.

344
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:46,322
Good.

345
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,122
I talked to Jim this morning.

346
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:52,819
Yeah?

347
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,258
Yeah.

348
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:58,163
He said your place
got broken into.

349
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:00,083
I told him not to
tell you anything.

350
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,419
Come on, he just knew I'd
be concerned, that's all.

351
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:04,210
It was nothing.

352
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:05,266
What do you mean
it's nothing, hon?

353
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,419
Somebody breaks
into your apartment,

354
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:07,698
and you're going to try to
tell me it's nothing now?

355
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:09,331
What is that?

356
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:11,538
It was nothing.
Really.

357
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,747
They didn't even take anything.

358
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:21,042
Is that for me?

359
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,354
Yes.

360
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,243
Ketchup only.
Thank you.

361
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,851
I've been thinking about, um,

362
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,395
what we were talking
about the other day.

363
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,019
What?

364
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,251
About us getting back together.

365
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:44,882
And?

366
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,010
I don't think it's such
a good idea right now.

367
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:55,859
Yeah.

368
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,707
I don't think anything
has changed with you.

369
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:09,394
I don't know.

370
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:12,851
Up you go.

371
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:17,874
You don't have to eat all of it.
Just what you can.

372
00:31:19,155 --> 00:31:20,115
Here you go.

373
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,387
Mr. Drood.

374
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,635
I know.
That's a new lock.

375
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,619
This is a new lock here.

376
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:39,923
Is it?
Listen, Mrs. Raines...

377
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:42,003
I don't have a key for that.

378
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,371
I made you a key.

379
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,387
If there should be
a fire or something...

380
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:47,442
Fuck!

381
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,235
I made you this key!

382
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:50,578
Do you have one for me?

383
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,307
Oh, God.

384
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,186
Tequila.
What?

385
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,362
Shot of tequila.

386
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:05,746
Five bucks.

387
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,274
I'm a friend of Jim's.

388
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:11,283
A friend of Jim's?
Yeah.

389
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:12,659
Five bucks.

390
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,698
Five tequilas then.

391
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:50,579
What are you doing?

392
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:55,987
Not doing anything.

393
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,818
I'm doing what you said.

394
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:03,538
Nothing.

395
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,594
Is that what I said?

396
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,330
What do you want?

397
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,299
Huh?

398
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,643
She loved you.

399
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,779
Somebody kills her
and you just blow it off.

400
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,579
Isn't that what you wanted?

401
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:43,219
You put a fucking gun
to my head.

402
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,475
Is that what's stopping you?

403
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,627
Is it the gun?

404
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,898
Who do you think you're fooling?

405
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,922
It ain't the gun that stops us.

406
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,370
We're just chicken shit.

407
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,754
See?

408
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,763
The lights are on

409
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,314
but nobody's home.

410
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:31,954
Am I right?

411
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:31,058
Mr. Drood.

412
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:34,098
There's just the two.

413
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,762
There's this one.

414
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:39,954
And the follow up on page three.

415
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:45,202
Oh, God.

416
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,155
So, what do you think?

417
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,314
I think we got a guy
with a wife and a kid.

418
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,306
And he's been cheating on her.

419
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,594
I wanted to be different
for a long time.

420
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,962
But I was the same.

421
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:48,274
I was always the same.

422
00:39:51,986 --> 00:39:53,714
I can't go back.

423
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:59,506
Back to what?

424
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:03,666
Back to what?

425
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,258
Van Gogh's pizza,

426
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,858
teriyaki chicken
and burrito, too.

427
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,362
You want to make an order?

428
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,666
Hello.
Hold it, this isn't me...

429
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,602
Zeta Temporary Office Services.

430
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:06,642
What are you doing here,
Mr. Drood?

431
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,490
This is a crime scene, you're interfering
with a police investigation.

432
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,762
What the hell
are you doing here?

433
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,266
I didn't kill her.

434
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:05,874
Who's there?

435
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:07,986
What's the matter?

436
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:10,482
Jesus.

437
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:12,626
You scared the shit out of me.

438
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:13,970
How did you get in here?

439
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:15,794
Mrs. Raines let me in.

440
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,914
Nice.

441
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,690
What's all this then?

442
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:23,282
It is this that Yolanda
girl, isn't it?

443
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,746
Yeah.

444
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:30,290
You've been walking the same
cage for too long, my friend.

445
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:33,202
Listen, Jim, what do
you know about her?

446
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:35,794
She's dead. That's
what I know about her.

447
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:38,066
Dead and gone.

448
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,954
Here, I heard a terrific
joke at the club tonight.

449
00:42:39,986 --> 00:42:42,738
Yeah, yeah, I met her
that night at your club.

450
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,050
What night was that?

451
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:47,186
That reception for that
congressman asshole.

452
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,434
Oh, yeah.

453
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:50,706
Who did she come with?

454
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,306
Don't know.

455
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:53,490
She must have come
with somebody.

456
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:54,577
How should I know?

457
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:57,202
Look, have a drink.

458
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,609
Well, do you want to
hear this joke or not?

459
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:03,698
Yeah.

460
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:05,426
Right.

461
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:09,970
How many surrealist painters

462
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:12,434
does it take to screw
in a light bulb?

463
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:14,962
How many?

464
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:18,450
The fish.

465
00:43:20,658 --> 00:43:21,842
The fish.

466
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:23,922
Oh, come on.

467
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:29,778
All right, all right, right.

468
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,762
All right. Bloke goes into
an army surplus store

469
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:35,090
he says, "Excuse me, have you
got any camouflage trousers?"

470
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:37,586
The bloke says, "Yeah,
but we can't find them."

471
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,265
What?

472
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:46,866
He says, "Yeah, but
we can't find them."

473
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,410
The body.

474
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,674
All right, Sherlock,
you tell one.

475
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,818
The body.

476
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,002
The body?

477
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:00,178
Yeah, yeah, the body?

478
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:04,594
What's that? Some kind of
minimalist joke then or what?

479
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:22,226
Yolanda Caldwell.

480
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:24,498
No, she's still here.

481
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,777
Nobody picked her up?

482
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,770
Nope.

483
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:30,898
Did you contact her husband?

484
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:33,522
There wasn't any husband.

485
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,250
You know something
about a husband?

486
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,434
No, I...

487
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,290
I just thought, you
know, she was married.

488
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:40,722
What is your name?

489
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:45,202
A friend.

490
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,090
I need your name.
Nix...

491
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,650
...son. Nixon.

492
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,890
Richard Nixon.

493
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:54,610
It's with an "X".

494
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,626
Wanna see God?

495
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:27,794
You're fucking falling
apart on me, Buddy.

496
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,882
You didn't get
that envelope, right?

497
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,162
Right.

498
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:39,922
I told you.

499
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,481
He don't know nothing.

500
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:49,266
Then what is he doing
down at the morgue

501
00:45:50,802 --> 00:45:52,689
asking about her husband?

502
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:28,626
Nancy Barron.

503
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:37,937
Nye. Bobby Nye.

504
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,362
Oh, God.

505
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,154
Hey, Smiley, how you doing?
Hi, John.

506
00:48:11,185 --> 00:48:12,657
How ya doin'? Okay.

507
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,226
So, what are you doing here?

508
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:16,658
I got to talk to you
about this Drood case.

509
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:19,377
What's on your mind?

510
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:20,722
Let's walk, okay?

511
00:48:21,937 --> 00:48:23,217
Sure.

512
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:39,633
The kid's innocent, John.

513
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:43,538
The guy is sick.

514
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:49,489
Be straight with me, John.

515
00:48:49,522 --> 00:48:52,082
You're framing him to protect
yourself, aren't you?

516
00:48:53,585 --> 00:48:55,505
No.

517
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:57,394
I'm protecting you, Smiley.

518
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,410
Zeta Temp, remember?

519
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:06,322
Took you to a party, John.
I got you laid.

520
00:49:31,473 --> 00:49:32,722
Hey!

521
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:38,930
What the fuck
are you doin', huh?

522
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:41,937
Yeah, you.
I'm talkin' to you.

523
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,969
Like a bird on a wire.

524
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:51,250
You think this is a joke, huh?

525
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,642
I'm sick of it, man.

526
00:49:54,673 --> 00:49:56,337
I want you to leave me
the fuck alone.

527
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,897
Zeta Temporary Office Services.

528
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:05,009
Yeah.

529
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,434
Do you know a Yolanda Caldwell?

530
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:10,897
Miss Caldwell is
no longer with us.

531
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:15,633
I have Miss Schell available.

532
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,489
She was trained
by Miss Caldwell.

533
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:22,865
She was trained by...

534
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:25,233
Um... Could I make an
appointment with her?

535
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:34,002
Mr. Charles?

536
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,121
Brought your typewriter
and everything.

537
00:52:39,154 --> 00:52:41,105
Just in case.

538
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:43,217
Can I get you something?
Some water?

539
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,642
Uh, no, thank you.
You're an artist?

540
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,458
Yeah, listen, Miss...

541
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:51,282
Miss Schell.
Miss Schell.

542
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:53,810
Look, would you
like to get started?

543
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,153
Mmm?

544
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:59,761
Yeah. Yeah. Are you sure?
I can't get you something?

545
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:02,354
Some coffee, tea?

546
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:05,617
Okay, you fix some tea
and I'll get set up.

547
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:22,321
Listen, maybe I just ought...

548
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:27,410
You're kidding right?

549
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:30,257
No.

550
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:33,393
I ain't Santa Claus.

551
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,881
Wait a second.

552
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,066
Just relax.

553
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:39,345
Wait a second.

554
00:53:39,377 --> 00:53:42,289
Look, do you want
to get it on or not?

555
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,625
Not! Not!

556
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:50,577
That's Nancy Barron.

557
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:53,617
What did you say?

558
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,145
Listen, I don't...
I don't know nothin'.

559
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:57,457
What did you say?
Oh, God.

560
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,505
Nancy what? Nancy what?
Oh, please.

561
00:54:00,177 --> 00:54:01,457
What is her name?

562
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,249
What is her name!

563
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,754
It's Yolanda.
It's Yolanda Caldwell.

564
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:07,793
You said another name, Nancy something.
Nancy what? Nancy Barron?

565
00:54:08,561 --> 00:54:09,906
I won! I won!

566
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,826
Hi.

567
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,169
Oh, shit.

568
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:19,954
Helen, this isn't what it is.

569
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:21,457
What is it?
Just give me a second.

570
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,217
Would you excuse us,
please? Helen.

571
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:24,529
She's a model right?

572
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,834
No. She's a secretary.

573
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:29,553
You are unbelievable.

574
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:31,505
Helen, I swear to God.
Unbelievable...

575
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:32,946
Oh, Jesus!

576
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:34,641
Helen!

577
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:37,425
Helen, wait.

578
00:54:37,457 --> 00:54:38,641
Listen...
Fuck you.

579
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:41,009
I can explain, just slow down.
You're going to kill me here.

580
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:42,449
You're sick, Drood.
You really need help.

581
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,466
Helen, please, I swear to you,
it's not what it seems like.

582
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:45,937
Helen!
Oh, right!

583
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:02,450
Oh, fuck!

584
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,593
Mrs. Raines.

585
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:24,337
Mrs. Raines.

586
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:30,129
Mrs. Raines.

587
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,521
I need that key back.

588
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:15,057
Hey, hey, hey!

589
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:19,921
What else did you take
out of the envelope?

590
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:21,073
What?

591
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,737
What else did you take?

592
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,625
Oh, I don't have any?

593
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:28,273
You took these things.
You took these things.

594
00:57:28,305 --> 00:57:30,673
What else did you take
out of the envelope? Huh?

595
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:33,105
What else?

596
00:57:33,137 --> 00:57:35,345
Tell me what you saw?
What did you see?

597
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:37,297
Don't hurt me.
What else did you see?

598
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,609
Please.

599
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:41,137
What else?
Please don't hurt me.

600
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,721
Please. Oh!

601
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:51,185
Oh, God.

602
00:57:57,425 --> 00:57:58,769
I'm sorry.

603
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:05,105
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

604
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:24,721
God!

605
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:28,785
You the one who wanted
to see Smiley?

606
00:59:28,817 --> 00:59:30,161
Come on.

607
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:44,113
Hey, Smiley,
you going fishing tomorrow?

608
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:45,841
You got me for two more weeks.

609
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:51,793
Okay, a toast to
Smiley, a hardnosed cop.

610
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,408
To Smiles!

611
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:22,993
Come on. Come on.

612
01:00:24,273 --> 01:00:25,585
Move it! Move!

613
01:01:01,937 --> 01:01:03,120
Helen.

614
01:01:04,273 --> 01:01:05,617
It's me.

615
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,305
Oh, God!

616
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:10,577
Let me in.

617
01:01:11,441 --> 01:01:12,529
Look, I don't want you here.

618
01:01:13,105 --> 01:01:14,769
Helen, listen to me.

619
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,425
Helen, open the door.
No!

620
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:18,897
Helen, you've got
the phone off the hook.

621
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:20,081
Yeah, that's right.

622
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:22,064
Helen, open the door. No!

623
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:24,081
I am in trouble here.

624
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,321
I'm in real trouble.

625
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,369
I'm in real trouble. No, I'm
not listening to any of this!

626
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:30,352
So just get away from my house!

627
01:01:57,873 --> 01:01:59,889
Damn you.

628
01:02:00,657 --> 01:02:02,193
Drood.

629
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:05,776
Drood.

630
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:12,273
Drood.

631
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:17,777
Helen, I'm sorry.

632
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,729
What is this?
What's this all about?

633
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:21,905
I'm sorry.
What the hell...

634
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,537
You can't just come in here
like this anymore. I'm sorry.

635
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:25,776
It's just...

636
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,952
You've got to listen to me.
You got to.

637
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:29,968
There was this woman...

638
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:32,177
Another woman? Wait a minute, wait
a minute. I don't know how...

639
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:34,833
You're gonna tell me you came here tonight
to talk to me about another woman.

640
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,529
- Helen, you've gotta listen to the whole story.
- Helen.

641
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:39,313
You've got to listen, it's the whole thing.
I swear to...

642
01:02:59,184 --> 01:03:00,529
I'm gonna throw up.

643
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,441
Drood, I want you to leave.

644
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,368
Drood.

645
01:03:13,553 --> 01:03:14,865
I want to see Bean.

646
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,928
You look through all these?

647
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:28,305
Not yet.

648
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,657
Uh-huh, yep.

649
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:13,808
Excuse me,
are you Mrs. Drood?

650
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,632
Yes, sir.

651
01:06:15,665 --> 01:06:17,904
Well, I'm sorry to bother
you at work here but...

652
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:19,281
You're from the police.

653
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:20,465
Yes, ma'am.

654
01:06:21,392 --> 01:06:25,361
I'm Detective Smiley.
Benjamin Smiley.

655
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:27,952
Here's my card. Do you
mind if I sit down?

656
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,424
No. No, not at all.

657
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,129
I'd just like to ask you
a couple of questions...

658
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:40,688
Excuse me.

659
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:42,737
Vinewood Nursery School.

660
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:44,368
Helen, it's me.

661
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:49,201
Mrs. Hernandez, uh, yes.

662
01:06:49,232 --> 01:06:51,825
Could you call back later? Yes,
I'm in a meeting right now.

663
01:06:51,856 --> 01:06:53,776
Helen, please don't hang up.
Uh-huh.

664
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,344
Listen, I've got to talk to you.

665
01:06:55,377 --> 01:06:57,616
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Helen. Helen, no please...

666
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:04,977
...the death of Yolanda
Caldwell is the murder of Adrienne Schell,

667
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:06,608
who was found shot
through the head

668
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:10,673
in the apartment of newspaper cartoonist,
C.C. Drood, earlier this morning.

669
01:07:10,704 --> 01:07:12,816
Drood, previously
questioned in the case,

670
01:07:12,849 --> 01:07:15,760
is now the prime suspect
in the investigation.

671
01:07:15,793 --> 01:07:18,961
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for his arrest.

672
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:24,240
He is described as a 30 year old
white male, 5'11", 180 pounds,

673
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,968
thought to be driving a...

674
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:38,992
Scoot over.

675
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,865
It's not just you and me.

676
01:07:49,073 --> 01:07:52,273
There's a lot of people
involved in this, big people,

677
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:53,968
anyone who went to a party.

678
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:09,841
Drood has got to go down
on this or we all go down.

683
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,776
No. Oh, damn it.

Drood had a book, it was a
little red appointment book.

687
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,736
And he used to write down
all his important things.

688
01:08:38,768 --> 01:08:42,193
I think he kept it in here. Now have you
seen that? Did you find that in here?

689
01:08:42,224 --> 01:08:45,808
Oh, he was always
such a nice man.

Okay, Don, I want this
bar ready by 9:30.

701
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:20,880
Oh, Christ.

702
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:25,456
Come on.

703
01:09:26,928 --> 01:09:28,240
What are you going to do?

704
01:09:29,616 --> 01:09:31,345
You got something to drink?

705
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,040
I'm afraid to go into
a fucking liquor store.

706
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:37,969
Drood, you're making
the front page, man.

707
01:09:38,896 --> 01:09:40,720
You're on television.

708
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:43,440
Helen's going crazy and Bean's
having trouble at school.

709
01:09:43,473 --> 01:09:44,656
Are you going to
listen to me or not?

710
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:47,217
No! You're a selfish fuck.

711
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:48,464
I'm calling the police.

712
01:09:51,632 --> 01:09:53,904
I'll tell them you
wanna turn yourself...

713
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:56,336
Now, come on, Drood, stop now.

714
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,176
I need your car.

715
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,713
My car?
Yeah.

716
01:10:02,352 --> 01:10:03,728
Forget it.

717
01:10:10,224 --> 01:10:11,217
Give me the keys.

718
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:13,008
No.

719
01:10:14,288 --> 01:10:16,176
Give me the fucking keys!

720
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,896
"Bobby Nye..."

721
01:10:44,272 --> 01:10:47,120
"Nancy Barron,
aide to Bobby Nye."

722
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:29,776
Gee.

723
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,472
Never mind, never mind.

724
01:12:31,504 --> 01:12:33,712
No, no, no.
Don't bother yourself.

725
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:36,144
George.

726
01:12:38,736 --> 01:12:41,136
Would you get this
gentleman another drink?

727
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,425
Here, let me introduce
you to a few people.

728
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:46,512
No. I...

729
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:49,424
This is Councilman Hancock
and his wife Dorothy,

730
01:12:49,456 --> 01:12:53,648
Supervisor Clealand, Mr. McGrath
and Patricia Menninger.

731
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:59,312
And this is Mr. Drood,
isn't it?

732
01:13:03,056 --> 01:13:05,360
Mr. Drood
is an artist.

733
01:13:05,392 --> 01:13:08,048
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with your work, Mr. Drood.

734
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,584
Oh, you will be, Pat.

735
01:13:11,376 --> 01:13:13,616
Excuse me, more champagne?

736
01:13:15,793 --> 01:13:17,872
May I get you anything
else, Miss Nye?

737
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:23,056
Bobby Nye.
You're Bobby Nye.

738
01:13:23,088 --> 01:13:25,041
Let me show you
around. Come on.

739
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,752
What do you think,
Mr. Drood?

740
01:13:45,744 --> 01:13:47,856
I overpaid a bit for that.

741
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:53,168
But I think its value
is about to skyrocket.

742
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,824
That's what usually happens
when an artist dies.

743
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:18,640
You killed her.

744
01:14:26,992 --> 01:14:28,368
That depends.

745
01:14:29,776 --> 01:14:32,176
I prefer to think
that you killed her.

746
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:35,056
She betrayed me.

747
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,816
Over what?

748
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:40,528
Some pictures?
Some photographs?

749
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,224
You don't know what love is?

750
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:45,296
Do you?

751
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:23,088
What a fucking joke.

752
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,664
Let me tell you something.

753
01:15:48,432 --> 01:15:49,776
She was nice to me.

754
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:55,504
She was very nice to me.

755
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,512
But Miss Nye told me to hit her.

756
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,224
And I did.

757
01:16:13,488 --> 01:16:14,864
And she fell.

758
01:16:20,688 --> 01:16:23,216
She hit her fucking head
on a coffee table.

759
01:16:25,296 --> 01:16:26,896
She broke her neck.

760
01:16:30,064 --> 01:16:31,408
Isn't that somethin'?

761
01:16:34,352 --> 01:16:36,208
The whole thing is
a fucking accident.

762
01:16:48,944 --> 01:16:50,128
Well...

763
01:16:58,192 --> 01:16:59,536
Please.

764
01:17:02,736 --> 01:17:04,656
Please.

765
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:07,024
I'm sorry, Mr. Drood.

766
01:17:24,112 --> 01:17:25,168
No!

767
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,296
No.

768
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,328
- Hello?
- Helen.

769
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:11,248
Drood.
Are you alone?

770
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:12,912
No, no, not exactly.

771
01:18:16,368 --> 01:18:17,808
I need your help.

772
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:21,200
Yes, yes I know.

773
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:23,151
Do you remember
our second honeymoon?

774
01:18:23,984 --> 01:18:25,296
Do... What?

775
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:27,247
Do you remember the room?

776
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,592
Honey, I don't see
what this has to...

777
01:18:28,624 --> 01:18:30,608
Now, it's okay,
just listen, please.

778
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:34,704
Do you remember the room?

779
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:36,976
Yes. Do you remember
the room number?

780
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,464
Yes, of course,
I do. It's...

781
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:42,768
Don't say it. Just...
Do you remember it?

782
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:45,616
Yes.

783
01:18:45,648 --> 01:18:47,151
Okay.

784
01:18:47,184 --> 01:18:48,815
Drood, are you...
I'm okay.

785
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:52,624
Where have you been?

786
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:57,328
I've been looking
everywhere for you, Drood.

787
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,624
What do you want me to do?

788
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:03,536
I need your help.

789
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:06,160
Okay. I'm listening.

790
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:09,231
I need some money,
and a change of clothes.

791
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,376
Okay.

792
01:19:11,407 --> 01:19:14,031
I will be there
as soon as I can.

793
01:19:26,352 --> 01:19:29,264
Jim, will you watch
Bean for me, please?

794
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:33,456
You're going then?

795
01:19:35,088 --> 01:19:38,160
Helen, he's off his bloody head.

796
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:47,408
Hello.

797
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,767
Detective Smiley, please.
This is he.

798
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,064
Detective, this is Helen Drood.
I know where my husband is.

799
01:20:06,288 --> 01:20:08,399
Helen, this is
completely insane.

800
01:20:08,432 --> 01:20:09,648
My keys.

801
01:20:12,335 --> 01:20:14,288

What are you doing?

817
01:22:16,752 --> 01:22:18,128
Thank you.

818
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:21,104
Thank you.

819
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,143
It's Bean's. I thought
you might need a hat.

820
01:22:33,744 --> 01:22:35,087
What's wrong?

821
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:41,039
I'm just imagining myself
on the run in this hat.

822
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:46,799
Drood, stop it.

823
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:48,304
Fugitive elf.

824
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:00,368
No, Drood, Drood, Drood.
It's Smiley.

825
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,128
What?

826
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,847
I called Detective Smiley.
You what?

827
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,184
All you have to do is
talk to him, that's all.

828
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,975
Helen. Helen,
are you crazy?

829
01:23:09,008 --> 01:23:10,895
No, just talk to him.
No!

830
01:23:10,928 --> 01:23:12,144
Drood, no!

831
01:23:12,175 --> 01:23:14,127
Don't, Helen, don't open the door.
Helen!

832
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,440
He's got a gun.

833
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:19,599
Mr. Drood.

834
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,735
Can you hear me,
Mr. Drood?

835
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,807
I just want to talk you.

836
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,896
Helen, get out of there.

837
01:23:26,927 --> 01:23:28,175
Look...
Get...

838
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:30,832
Mr. Drood, I'm gonna show
you my hands, all right.

839
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:34,767
Okay, I'm gonna come into
the room now, Mr. Drood.

840
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:36,592
No!
Drood.

841
01:23:44,143 --> 01:23:46,831
I'm on your side,
Mr. Drood.

842
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:49,136
Drood, just listen to him, okay.

843
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:51,248
He's lying. He's in on it. All
you have to do is listen to him.

844
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:56,304
I really want to
help you, Mr. Drood.

845
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,095
I know you didn't kill anybody.

846
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,336
Put it down.

847
01:24:05,615 --> 01:24:08,111
What the hell
are you doing here, John?

848
01:24:18,192 --> 01:24:19,567
Put it down.

849
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:32,272
Kick it over here.

850
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:38,288
I told you to stay out of this.

851
01:24:39,056 --> 01:24:40,431
It's over, John.

852
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:45,872
Give me the gun.

853
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,295
Give me the...
Smiley, don't.

854
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,215
Don't make me do this.

855
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:54,320
Give me the gun, John.

856
01:24:54,352 --> 01:24:55,503
Give me the...

857
01:24:55,535 --> 01:24:57,103
No!

858
01:25:33,231 --> 01:25:35,440
- Come on.
- What do we do?

859
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:37,200
Get the stuff.
What are we going to do?

860
01:25:37,231 --> 01:25:39,120
Come on.
No.

861
01:25:39,151 --> 01:25:41,391
We gotta get out of here. No.

862
01:25:44,592 --> 01:25:47,023
Go, go, go!
Would you please...

863
01:25:47,056 --> 01:25:48,463
I told him you
couldn't kill anybody.

864
01:25:48,495 --> 01:25:50,991
I wasn't trying. If I was
trying, I would've missed.

865
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:54,032
Oh, God!

866
01:25:54,063 --> 01:25:55,215
Drood, what are we going to do?

867
01:25:56,048 --> 01:25:57,487
Fuck!

868
01:25:58,224 --> 01:25:59,888
Now I'm a cop killer.

869
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:03,503
I am dead. I'm...

870
01:26:07,055 --> 01:26:08,303
Drood.

871
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:09,711
I'm dead.

872
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:11,120
Drood, you're scaring me.

873
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:13,775
I'm a dead man, Helen.

874
01:26:13,807 --> 01:26:16,047
Where's the toolbox?
I got it. I got it.

875
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:17,135
Go, go, go!

876
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:19,215
Drood, I'm going. I'm going.
What are you doing?

877
01:26:19,248 --> 01:26:21,135
Turn up here.
No, right.

878
01:26:21,168 --> 01:26:22,480
Oh, Drood.

879
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,727
I'm going to kill myself.

880
01:26:23,759 --> 01:26:25,104
What?

881
01:26:25,135 --> 01:26:27,823
Drood, just say something
that makes sense, all right?

882
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:40,591
Tell them I forced
you to drive me up here,

883
01:26:40,624 --> 01:26:42,575
that I said that
I had to meet somebody.

884
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:47,983
You picked me up
outside the hotel.

885
01:26:48,015 --> 01:26:49,872
You weren't in the room, okay?

886
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:54,895
What do I tell Bean?

887
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,527
Tell her that I'll be there.

888
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:11,663
Okay?

889
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:24,047
There.
Take care of yourself.

890
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:25,967
I love you.

891
01:29:14,576 --> 01:29:16,303
The lights are on

892
01:29:18,927 --> 01:29:20,559
but nobody's home.

893
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:07,311
My head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

894
01:31:07,343 --> 01:31:11,791
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

895
01:31:11,823 --> 01:31:15,119
And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

896
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:57,007
Helen.
Drop dead.
