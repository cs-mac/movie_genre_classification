1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>Good morning. It's 6 a.m.
on a beautiful morning in Boston.</i>

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,200
<i>These are the top stories:</i>

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,500
<i>Mayor White's assistant has met
with the Redevelopment Authority...</i>

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
<i>...over the controversy
on the Town Heights project.</i>

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
<i>Saugus: Police have arrested
contractor James McManus...</i>

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>...on $ 23 million grant
and bribery charges...</i>

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,000
<i>...in connection with the Mystic
River extension. Hyannis Port....</i>

8
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,799
Mrs. Levine is day five
post-cholecystectomy.

9
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:05,899
She remains afebrile and her previous
anorexia is gone, draining well.

10
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,499
An AP chest film is clear.
Her white count is nine-four.

11
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,099
BUN has stabilized at 40.2,
good output of 1 600cc's.

12
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,199
-Blood cultures?
-No growth times two.

13
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:18,899
Well, Harris can't nail us on this one.

14
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,199
Next case.

15
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,999
-lt was a long time ago.
-And is he good?

16
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,499
Yeah, he can really break it up!

17
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,199
Billy's weird.

18
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:32,999
He gets so tired.

19
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,699
Do you like this lipstick?

20
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,199
She was terrific.

21
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,199
lt's 32 now and going fast.

22
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,899
He can't afford to get out.

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,399
l got a thousand shares of that.

24
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,799
We have to have the AP, lateral and
1 0 units done before they can begin.

25
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,699
lt says here, type and cross-match
was done yesterday.

26
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,299
Just standard workup procedure.

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,599
Well, l don't know.

28
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,299
So it was a clear case of endocarditis.

29
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:59,799
We're ready when you are,
Dr. Wheeler.

30
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,299
No response to antibiotics.

31
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:06,798
Cut her, okay?

32
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,398
-Sponge.
-Begin to tie off.

33
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:17,598
<i>It's all politics.
Today, for instance...</i>

34
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:22,598
...Rudnick says to me, ''l hear you're
the new chief resident in surgery.''

35
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,398
-That's great!
-He was testing me.

36
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,698
Then he says that Harris told him...

37
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,198
...that Mark Bellows was going to be
the next chief resident.

38
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,598
-Wonderful, Mark.
-But here's the thing.

39
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:37,798
He waited for me to say l knew
about it. That wouldn't look right.

40
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:41,998
That would look as if l expected it.
So l said l hadn't heard anything.

41
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:44,498
You've wanted it for two years.

42
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,598
But there's no point
in saying that, is there?

43
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:48,998
l said...

44
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:51,998
...l thought it'd be wonderful
if it happened.

45
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:55,298
l said Chandler was doing
an excellent job as chief resident.

46
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,798
But l said there was a little room
left for improvement.

47
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,798
Chandler's damn good.

48
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:04,198
l really laid it on thick
with old Rudnick.

49
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:08,997
l told him l was following his hepatic
research, cited some references.

50
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,797
He was impressed.

51
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:13,197
Procedure went well too.

52
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,897
So all in all, it was a good day.

53
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,197
l'm gonna take a shower.
Can you grab me a beer before dinner?

54
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:21,697
Hey, Mark.

55
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:22,997
Get your own beer.

56
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:26,497
-Honey, for chrissakes, come on.
-l want to take a shower.

57
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:28,997
-l was on call last night.
-So was l.

58
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:30,897
l know, but l had two arrests...

59
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:34,197
...aortic aneurysm blew at 4 a.m.,
had to be done stat.

60
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:38,097
So l didn't get any sleep, and
l'd really like to take a shower.

61
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:42,397
lf you don't mind.

62
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,297
l had a hard day too.

63
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,397
You get in the shower faster
than any person alive.

64
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:50,897
Have a beer.
You'll feel better.

65
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:56,497
l know what'd make me feel better.

66
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,697
Goddamn doctors.

67
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:02,097
Couldn't have fallen
in love with a nurse.

68
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,197
Dorothy on the eighth floor.

69
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,797
She liked me.

70
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,097
My own apartment.

71
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:18,996
Did you hear about Louis?

72
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,396
What about Louis?

73
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,296
They passed him up
as assistant professor.

74
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,796
Guy's really paid his dues too.
Now they don't take him.

75
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:30,096
Plus his son is waiting
for a kidney transplant.

76
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,096
Did you start dinner?

77
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:34,696
What?

78
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,096
Did you start dinner?

79
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:40,996
-Did you hear anything l said?
-lt's in the fridge. Just heat it up.

80
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:45,396
-l was telling you about my day.
-l had a hard day too.

81
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:48,096
Just go heat it up.

82
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:52,096
Why is it, whenever we're about
to fight, you're always undressed?

83
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:55,096
What's the big deal?
Just heat up the stew.

84
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,096
-Why won't you help out?
-ls that the way you see it?

85
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,996
l make my concessions.
You always take a shower first.

86
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,096
l don't.

87
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,796
You do too,
and l'm getting tired of it.

88
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:07,596
Honey, come on.

89
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:08,596
Don't call me honey.

90
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:12,396
l'm trying to tell you about my day.
Something that happened.

91
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:15,096
Your days are always the same.

92
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,796
What is that supposed to mean?

93
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,895
Just politics, that's all.

94
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:24,095
Who said what to whom.
Who's rising, who's falling.

95
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,895
Who's made a good move, a bad move.
Politics!

96
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,995
Somebody has to be interested
in hospital politics.

97
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,295
You certainly are not.

98
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:34,695
l thought you were a surgical
resident, not a political one.

99
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,895
l like politics.

100
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,295
They interest me. Just because
you're always looking for--

101
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,995
You want me to heat up
the dinner, is that it?

102
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,295
l want some respect.

103
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:48,895
Susan, come on.
Don't leave again.

104
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,495
Why can't you share
half the responsibility?

105
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,895
l share more than
half the responsibility!

106
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,295
-No need to shout.
-Why are you running off?

107
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,395
You think l want this?
Let me tell you something.

108
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:02,095
l make concessions
for this so-called relationship.

109
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,095
l know it's hard on you politically.

110
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,195
Susan, don't go.

111
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,695
You know what the trouble with you is?

112
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,295
All you care about
is being chief resident.

113
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:23,995
You know what your trouble is?
You don't want a relationship.

114
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:26,494
Look at you.
You run away from it.

115
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,294
This is ridiculous.

116
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,594
You don't want a lover...

117
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:32,794
...you want a goddamn wife!

118
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,894
Bastard.

119
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,694
l have a bleeder here.

120
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:32,393
-l need more suction.
-Clamp.

121
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:39,393
He's not di-toxic.
He has advanced ASHD.

122
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,993
l just bought some at 43.

123
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:47,693
Yeah, l hear they have management
problems. l sold at 37.

124
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,093
How are you?

125
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,393
l'm fine. The case went well.
No problem.

126
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:57,893
Good.

127
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:02,093
l'm really sorry about last night.

128
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,893
So am l.

129
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,793
-You want to have some lunch?
-l have class.

130
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:09,793
You don't think this is
more important than the class?

131
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:13,793
That class is the only time
l get out of this damn hospital.

132
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,693
Can you understand that?
lt's important to me!

133
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,793
You're impossible!

134
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:21,193
Seven, eight, step!

135
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:25,593
Back. Step.

136
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:27,893
Out!

137
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:33,393
One, two, down three,
up four and open.

138
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:36,793
And one and two,
three and four.

139
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,492
Stretch.

140
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,092
Walk two, three, four...

141
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:44,792
...and five and six, seven,
eight and back.

142
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,892
-You gonna leave Mark?
-l don't know.

143
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,292
l went home last night.

144
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:50,992
Again?

145
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,092
He's impossible.

146
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,992
Did you see Dr. Richards?

147
00:08:58,992 --> 00:08:59,892
l don't know.

148
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:04,392
Apparently you can tell by looking at
the cervix. lt's a different color.

149
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:08,492
He did the lab tests and he says
l'm definitely 8 to 1 0 weeks pregnant.

150
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,092
So Dr. Richards is doing
a D and C tomorrow.

151
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,092
For menstrual irregularity.

152
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,192
lt's simple, isn't it?

153
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,392
Are you worried?

154
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:24,692
l know you do this every day but, sure,
l'm worried. Who wouldn't be?

155
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,392
lt'll be fine, Nancy.
lt's routine procedure.

156
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,192
We're going to the lce Capades.

157
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:38,992
lt's real crowded.

158
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,192
Patient on call?

159
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:43,992
-Coming right down, Dr. Cowans.
-The instruments are autoclaved.

160
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,891
Let's teach you fellas
some anesthesiology.

161
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,691
This is your standard anesthesia.

162
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:53,391
You've got two main wall lines.
Nitrous oxide on the left and oxygen.

163
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,891
We got a case today that's a D and C.

164
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:59,391
lt's one of Dr. Richard's cases.
Actually, it's a TAB.

165
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:04,091
That's a therapeutic abortion.
Keep it clean. lt's a married patient.

166
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,191
On the cart here,
we got two manometers...

167
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:10,591
...with flow valves here and here
to regulate gas.

168
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,091
We got emergency oxygen down here...

169
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,891
...which we checked and that's full.

170
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,591
During surgery, we'll be recording this
and the vital signs.

171
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,991
Hey, how is Bess?

172
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:22,391
l don't know.

173
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,991
ln and out.

174
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,991
Boy, she has more rails
than anybody l know.

175
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,491
She's seeing a shrink now.

176
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,391
One, two, three, up!

177
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,391
Anybody we know?

178
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:38,491
Morning, Nancy. Remember me?
l'm Dr. Cowans.

179
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:43,491
That's right, dear,
and you'll have a nice long sleep.

180
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,991
Pre-op, she's received a 0.0 1
of Demerol and 0.4 of atropine...

181
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,491
...so believe me,
she's pretty relaxed.

182
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:54,290
l'll say she's relaxed!
Come on, Mrs. Greenly, on your back.

183
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,790
That's it.

184
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,590
-Gonna meet me for lunch?
-l don't know.

185
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,490
l'll let you know, okay?

186
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,290
l'll be in the lounge.

187
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,690
Henry might be calling,
and if he does, you know....

188
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,790
-Okay, no problem.
-Yeah, okay.

189
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,590
-Good afternoon, Tom.
-Afternoon, Jim. How's our lady?

190
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,690
Just about ready.

191
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,390
l'm still awake.

192
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,890
-But not for long, dear.
-You promise?

193
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,190
l'll induce with sodium Pentothal,
give an lV by syringe.

194
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,990
Nance, what l want you to do...

195
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,890
...is start counting from 1 00
backwards real slow, okay?

196
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,990
Here we go.

197
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,290
-A hundred.
-Ninety-nine...

198
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,790
...ninety-eight...

199
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,590
...ninety-seven...

200
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,190
...ninety-six....

201
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,390
lt's quick. Stop the pentothal.

202
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,990
You see, pentothal isn't
really an anesthetic.

203
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,890
Any deep pain right now
and she'd wake right up.

204
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,890
What we need for anesthesia is gas.

205
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,489
First l'll inject some succinylcholine.

206
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,689
l want you to watch her chest gauge
because she'll stop breathing.

207
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:07,889
She's now experiencing
complete muscular paralysis.

208
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,189
She's got three minutes
to breathe or she'll suffocate.

209
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,189
So now we intubate.

210
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,989
Taking a laryngoscope like so.

211
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,189
Hold her head
in an extended position.

212
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,889
Enter laterally, put up
the base of the tongue, up and out...

213
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,689
...visualizing the trachea.

214
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,289
There it is, fellas. Take a look.

215
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,789
You see it?
lt's right over there.

216
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,189
Come on, guys!

217
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,789
Take our tube and enter here.

218
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,589
ln the middle of surgery,
l'll switch over to the telothane.

219
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:43,689
Stirrups up?

220
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,689
How is John?

221
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,489
His fever broke today.
He'll go back to school tomorrow.

222
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,589
Now we can check
the pupillary reflexes.

223
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,289
Though she's unconscious,
the pupils should react to light...

224
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,889
...and let us know
that the old brain is okay.

225
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,888
That's it. Anesthesia's the easiest job
in the world until something goes wrong.

226
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,488
lt's 99% boredom
and 1 % scared-shitless panic...

227
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,888
...which we try to avoid.
The patient's yours, Dr. Richards.

228
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,788
lf you move in behind me...

229
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:18,188
...you'll see what l am going to do
for this young woman.

230
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,388
Some music, please.

231
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,988
Actually, what l'm going to do
is get her out of a hell of a mess.

232
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,988
She's pregnant.

233
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:30,588
She doesn't want her husband to know.

234
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,888
lt's none of my business.

235
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,288
l'm just her surgeon.
l don't run her life.

236
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:42,088
So in fact, our task is simplified...

237
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,988
...when the uterus is
anteverted and anteflexed.

238
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:49,088
This is a function of the muscular
attachments, of which there are five.

239
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,388
You should know them.

240
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,088
They're the broad ligaments,
the round and cardinal ligaments...

241
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,688
...and the endopelvic fascia,
the uterosacral ligaments.

242
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:05,288
Something wrong?

243
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,587
She just threw a PVC,
and her blood pressure's falling.

244
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:11,987
l got 90 over 60.

245
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:15,287
She's fully oxygenated.
Red as a cherry down here.

246
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,687
How much longer you got?

247
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:20,487
Just a couple of minutes.

248
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,187
l don't like this.
Her blood pressure is still falling.

249
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,387
Damn!

250
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:30,287
We should stop. She may be getting
too much vagal stimulation.

251
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,887
Jesus Christ.

252
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:32,987
What's the matter?

253
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,487
l don't know.
Nothing's the matter!

254
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:37,887
Something's the matter.
She's going to arrest!

255
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:38,987
l can't find anything!

256
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,887
l get a 1 00 over 80.
Her pressure's climbing.

257
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:02,787
Let's finish up. l'd like to get
this mother off the table.

258
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,087
Sponge, please.

259
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:13,587
One-twenty over 80 and climbing.
She's okay.

260
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:19,086
-These tissues can go to pathology.
-Can l start bringing her out?

261
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,786
Yeah, bring her out, Jim.

262
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:28,886
Okay, Mrs. Greenly,
it's time to wake up.

263
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,586
Okay, Nancy?

264
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:33,486
Mrs. Greenly? Wake up.

265
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:36,686
Nance, can you give me
a cough, please?

266
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:55,586
Jesus Christ!
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.

267
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,086
The pupils, they're fixed.

268
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,186
Dilated.

269
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,386
Oh, my God!

270
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:11,786
Pre-op diagnosis,
acute gastric ulceration.

271
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,386
Post-op diagnosis, the same.

272
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,486
Surgeon, Dr. Wilson.

273
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,885
-Where's Schwartz? Cholecystectomy?
-Bed three.

274
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,385
-Mr. Schwartz, l'm Dr. Bellows.
-You don't got to talk so loud.

275
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:30,785
How you feel?

276
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,085
Just ''eh''?

277
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,885
You want to get on your side
for me, please?

278
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,785
-On your side.
-Speak up, l can't hear you.

279
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,585
What'd they give you
in that operating room?

280
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,085
Do you have any pain?

281
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:45,585
lf l had any pain,
l would go see a doctor.

282
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,585
Now you want to breathe
for me real easy?

283
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,185
That's it. Slowly.

284
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:55,785
She was given narceine
to rule out pre-op narcotic....

285
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,085
Easy!

286
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,185
Two units without effect,
a few peripheral fasciculations.

287
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,085
So it's not succinylcholine?

288
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,485
Delayed return of consciousness
of cryptogenic origin.

289
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:13,585
l see no reason not to transfer her
to the intensive care unit.

290
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:16,085
Mr. Schwartz, you're going to be fine.

291
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,985
That's what you think!

292
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,785
-A grim prognosis, to say the least.
-Rather tragic.

293
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,884
Someone should notify Dr. George.

294
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,384
He'll want to review
the anesthetic protocol.

295
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,584
Right, he's been paged.

296
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,884
Looks like
another anesthetic reaction.

297
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,984
Page Dr. Bendix.
4-4-4-3-2.

298
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,084
Check.

299
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,184
George is not here.

300
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:45,484
No, Dr. Bendix. Bendix!

301
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:48,384
Maybe he left the hospital.
Try his office.

302
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,984
Could you page Dr. Wheeler, please?

303
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:55,484
So you see, Jimmy,
your kidneys are sick.

304
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:56,884
They don't work right.

305
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:00,584
We need to take out the sick kidneys
and put in a new one.

306
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:01,684
Today?

307
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,784
No, not today.
We have to wait until...

308
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,084
...there's a kidney we can put in.

309
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,184
Tomorrow?

310
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:11,684
l don't know when.
But it could be a while.

311
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,584
<i>Dr. Wheeler, call extension 3-5-6.</i>

312
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:19,784
You can have one of these.
Which color do you like?

313
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:22,684
Purple.

314
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:24,284
Take two.

315
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,384
l like purple.

316
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,884
l can see that.

317
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,283
l like red too.

318
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,383
Dr. Wheeler.

319
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,383
Excuse me, l have to go
to intensive care now.

320
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,383
A nurse should be right in.

321
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,883
Surgical lCU.

322
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,483
What's her status?

323
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,783
Greenly?

324
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,983
Complete squash rot.

325
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,783
She's a total Gomer.

326
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,183
lt's brain death.

327
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,983
That patient was transferred
to the Jefferson lnstitute yesterday.

328
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:11,182
How can this happen?

329
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,382
All this....

330
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,582
Did you do an EEG?

331
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:25,182
Flat.

332
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:27,682
Completely flat?

333
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,782
Completely flat.

334
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:32,282
Did you repeat it?

335
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:33,982
No, not yet.

336
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,482
What happened during the D and C?

337
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:38,582
Nothing.

338
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,682
lt's an unremarkable case,
according to the notes.

339
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:44,082
Transient PVCs late in the operation.

340
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,981
Nothing else.

341
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,481
She never woke up?

342
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,281
l want to look at her chart.

343
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:10,781
lf it were my friend,
l don't know if l'd be that cool.

344
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:16,481
The potassium was what?

345
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,881
One-eight? Are you sure?

346
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,881
lt must be a mistake.

347
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,181
Honey, l'm sorry.

348
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,481
l know you two were really close.

349
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,481
Susan?

350
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,981
There doesn't seem to be
anything unusual in the chart.

351
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,581
Normal 28-year-old patient
in good health for a D and C...

352
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:47,481
...underwent telothane anesthesia,
comes out in irreversible coma.

353
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:51,580
lt's well-documented
that telothane causes liver damage...

354
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,280
...and severe side effects in
a small percentage of surgical cases.

355
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,380
-That's just the risk of anesthesia.
-l know you're upset.

356
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,680
l'm not upset.

357
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,680
You think because l'm a woman,
l'm going to be upset. l'm fine.

358
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,080
l want to understand the variables
as they apply to this patient.

359
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
l'm sure you agree that's indicated.

360
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,180
''This patient''?

361
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,180
Here we have an ordinary,
uninteresting case...

362
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,980
...of surgical reaction to telothane
anesthesia in a healthy patient.

363
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,080
As far as l can tell,
there are no unusual aspects...

364
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,380
...except that the patient
was tissue-typed.

365
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,780
Tissue-typed for D and C?

366
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,980
There's got to be some mistake.

367
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,980
Here it is. No name on the slip
and no billing number.

368
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,280
That's not the first time the lab
ran a test on the wrong patient.

369
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,580
Let's go home.
l think you're tired.

370
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,580
l think l'd better check
the tissue-typing lab.

371
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,980
Why?

372
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,979
Nancy's problem was not caused
by wrong lab tests.

373
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,179
l know.

374
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:08,479
Honey, you're grabbing at straws.

375
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,179
Let's go have some dinner.

376
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:13,379
-l'm not hungry.
-We'll check the lab later.

377
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,579
Stop acting as if
there's something wrong with me...

378
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,679
...or the way l'm thinking!
l'm checking the lab now.

379
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:20,679
They're closed.

380
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,579
l won't just stand here!

381
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:25,179
Susan, the lab is closed.

382
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,379
lt closed at six 6:00.

383
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,579
ls she all right?

384
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,679
Yeah, she just....

385
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,479
She likes to do things
her own way.

386
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:49,679
Who's that?

387
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,579
Dr. Wheeler.

388
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,379
We're closed.

389
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,579
We don't do any determinations
after six, doctor.

390
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,179
l want to look at
your requisition book.

391
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,078
What does it mean when there's
no name and number on the slip?

392
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:04,778
There's....

393
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,378
There's always
a name or a number, doctor.

394
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:11,578
For example, Nancy Greenly.
You did tissue-typing...

395
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,078
...but there's no physician name
and billing number.

396
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,678
Let me see.

397
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:22,078
Yes, you see, it's been
printed out by computer.

398
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:24,078
That's hospital policy.

399
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,278
A certain number of these tests
are randomly ordered by computer...

400
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:29,778
...as a quality check.

401
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:31,978
We do the tests here,
they're sent out...

402
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:34,078
...and done again by an outside lab.

403
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:36,578
The computer ordered
this test on Greenly?

404
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:39,578
Yeah, central computer.

405
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,778
Why don't you just show me?

406
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:43,278
-l can't.
-Why not?

407
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:44,978
l'm not supposed to.

408
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:46,678
lt's really important.

409
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:50,778
Anyway, that information
isn't coded.

410
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,978
lf it isn't coded,
l can't pull it out.

411
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,978
l mean, who would want it?

412
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:58,478
Well, let's say l wanted a list
of all the patients...

413
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:00,578
...who had tissue-typing
in the last month.

414
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,078
Same thing. Not coded.

415
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:04,778
What do you do?
What good is all this equipment?

416
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,478
l thought you recorded information.

417
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:11,077
We do, but the truth is, we install
these computers to bill patients.

418
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,177
We code patient name and number,
medical or surgical...

419
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:17,877
...admission diagnosis,
therapy and discharge diagnosis.

420
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,877
Okay, wait a minute.

421
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:23,377
Can you give me a list
of all surgical patients...

422
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:25,777
...with discharge diagnoses of coma?

423
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,577
Okay, we have...

424
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:45,577
...one general category
under ''coma'' ...

425
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,177
...and nine subcategories
under ''brain syndromes.''

426
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:50,377
Good.

427
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:53,477
l want a list
of all surgical patients...

428
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,677
...with general category
of coma in the past year.

429
00:25:58,877 --> 00:25:59,977
You're sure you want it?

430
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:12,577
l had no idea.

431
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,477
lt's a big hospital.

432
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,076
Are you married or what?

433
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:20,976
Thank you.

434
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,876
Surgical lCU. That's right.

435
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:17,876
Where'd you get this?

436
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:23,275
lt's against the law.
lt's illegal to tap a data bank.

437
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,775
l don't see why.
l'm a doctor.

438
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,575
-l've got research--
-That's not the point!

439
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:31,175
Every officer got the lecture.
No access without authorization.

440
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,175
-They can throw you out.
-Never mind that.

441
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,475
''Never mind''?

442
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,575
Look at this.

443
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,575
Two hundred and forty names.

444
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:43,075
Ten are young people
admitted for minor procedures.

445
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,975
Breast biopsy, appendectomy.

446
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:49,175
They all come out in a coma.
Aren't you surprised?

447
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:53,675
The risk of surgical anesthesia
is six per 1 00,000.

448
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:57,475
ln a hospital this size, 1 0 patients
in a year is not surprising.

449
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,575
So what are you doing?

450
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:03,175
You missed your rounds.
You didn't scrub in at the gastrectomy.

451
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,675
l had to do something.

452
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,275
Why don't you do your job?

453
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,875
Mr. Murphy is a 35-year-old
in good health...

454
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:16,375
...admitted for a meniscectomy.
He's scheduled for this morning.

455
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,775
Promises, promises.
They keep telling me...

456
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:20,675
...there's a delay, another half-hour.

457
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,175
Well, the suspense
is really killing me.

458
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,375
l thought you doctors
liked to operate.

459
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:28,074
-We'll get to you.
-l'd hate to be left out.

460
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,674
How did you get your injury?

461
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:31,374
Playing touch football.

462
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:34,074
You know, with the guys,
horsing around.

463
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,474
<i>Dr. Wheeler, see Dr. Harris.</i>

464
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,374
<i>See Dr. Harris in his office.</i>

465
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:41,774
The chief of surgery himself.

466
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,274
Playing touch football, huh?

467
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,474
Yeah. So l come in,
and all that happens--

468
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:53,774
Thanks very much, Herb.

469
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:55,774
We'll get together on it later.

470
00:28:57,174 --> 00:28:58,174
Would you come in?

471
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,574
Excuse me.

472
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,374
Sit down, Sue.

473
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,474
<i>It's Senator Brooke's office.</i>

474
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:30,374
<i>He wonders if you can
change the meeting to four.</i>

475
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:32,574
Yes, four is fine.
Notify Henry.

476
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:33,973
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

477
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:47,073
l like to think that Boston Memorial
is the best hospital in the city...

478
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:49,073
...perhaps in the country.

479
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,473
l'm committed to it...

480
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,973
...to the house staff we have here,
and to you.

481
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:56,873
l think you know that.

482
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,073
But we have certain constraints
imposed on us.

483
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:05,373
One is the state law concerning
privacy in computer data access.

484
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,473
An unauthorized entry was made
last night.

485
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,373
We put the young man on probation.

486
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:17,673
But he told us he made
the illegal entry on your behalf.

487
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:18,773
That's true.

488
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:22,873
All the discharge diagnoses
of coma over a 1 2-month period?

489
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,673
-l wanted it because l had an idea--
-Well, forgive me.

490
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:30,573
But it isn't a question
of why you wanted it...

491
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:32,573
...it's how you got it.

492
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,873
l understand you have personal reasons
for being under stress...

493
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:39,572
...for not acting as carefully
as you might.

494
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,172
And l'm sympathetic to the way
you must feel about...

495
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:46,572
...the Greely case.

496
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:48,472
Greenly. Nancy Greenly.

497
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,672
Greenly. Yes, Nancy Greenly case.

498
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:58,172
l certainly don't want to lose
a good surgical resident.

499
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,872
l think we can handle this, Sue.

500
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,972
l'll keep the evidence...

501
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:13,372
...and we'll forget
it ever happened, all right?

502
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:19,272
But l'd like you to see someone.

503
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:21,672
l was thinking of Dick Morelind.

504
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:24,472
Dr. Harris, l'm fine.
l don't need a shrink.

505
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,172
No, no, l know you don't.

506
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:29,672
But it's important to have
on record a talk with Dick Morelind.

507
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,672
-l don't see why.
-Actually...

508
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:35,472
...it's a precondition to
your continuing on here at Memorial.

509
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:40,772
l understand.

510
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,772
l think it's unfair.
Everybody's on my back.

511
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:46,871
Mark's whining about
how l can't make a commitment...

512
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,371
...and l'm cold,
and l'm afraid of intimacy.

513
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,471
Then this happens to Nancy...

514
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:54,471
...and she's my best friend
since boarding school.

515
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:57,271
Everyone jumps on my back,
acts like l'm neurotic...

516
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:59,471
...and l'm not doing my job!

517
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,771
There's concern about
breaking the law.

518
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:04,671
l wanted to do something.
Do you understand?

519
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,571
Do something right away.

520
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:10,171
l just couldn't sit there
and watch Nancy and....

521
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:12,771
How do you feel about
what happened?

522
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,371
Confused...

523
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,071
...that's all.

524
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,171
Just confused.

525
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,071
lt's very...

526
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,871
...confusing.

527
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,971
l wanted to understand
what happened to her.

528
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,871
Nobody else here seems to care.

529
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:32,971
Nobody else cares?

530
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:34,471
Listen.

531
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:38,371
There have been 1 0 cases
of unexplained coma...

532
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:42,171
...in young, healthy patients
in the last year.

533
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:44,471
Now, don't you find that surprising?

534
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:48,171
You don't.

535
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:53,470
Susan, this hospital does
30,000 operations a year.

536
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,170
l'm not surprised a few turn out
with serious unexplained side effects.

537
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,070
Medicine isn't perfect.

538
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,470
We all accept that.

539
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,870
Don't we?

540
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,670
There's a crisis
in her personal life.

541
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,970
-She's involved with a resident.
-l know.

542
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,470
lt's led her to overreact
to this situation...

543
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,970
...which she has not
consciously faced.

544
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,270
She's under stress
and a little paranoid.

545
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,170
Think we'll have
any more trouble with her?

546
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,870
l don't think so.

547
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,470
l hope you're right.

548
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,670
l hate to admit it. l think l was
really upset about Nancy.

549
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,170
You on call tonight?

550
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,570
So am l.

551
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,470
Why don't we have
a terrific dinner...

552
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,070
...just the two of us
in the hospital cafeteria?

553
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,970
-Sounds great!
-About 1 1 ?

554
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,270
You got a date.

555
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,270
Maybe afterwards, we can go to
our favorite room on the eighth floor.

556
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,370
Nobody will be there after midnight.

557
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,270
l think we're looking
at cortical anoxia.

558
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,570
-l'll check the Babinski.
-How old is he?

559
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,870
Thirty-five.

560
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,370
When did you administer
the additional dosage?

561
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,069
At the onset of cardiac irritability.
The surgeon said he was light.

562
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,269
Surgeons know nothing about anesthesia.
What'd you give?

563
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:03,569
Two cc's push.

564
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,969
There was no reason
there'd be a problem.

565
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,169
Just seemed a little light.

566
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,569
Some PVC in runs,
transient hypotension...

567
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:12,669
...but no sign of hypoxia.

568
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:15,969
Skin color and blood
were all red and fully oxygenated.

569
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,869
The pupils are fixed and dilated,
l must presume brain death.

570
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,869
Any relation to your other case?

571
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:23,069
Completely different.

572
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,169
Different staffs,
different anesthetic agents.

573
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,569
-He better be trached.
-Do we need a pulmonary consult?

574
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:30,769
Request the consult...

575
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,969
...but go ahead with the tracheotomy.

576
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:35,369
This is a long-term
management problem.

577
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,469
-Come on.
-lt happened again.

578
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,269
That's Dr. George, chief of anesthesia.
He's got it under control.

579
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:44,369
ls there a research protocol
this case would fit?

580
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,469
He's a good research case.
Excellent teaching material.

581
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,369
lt's true, Mr. Murphy
presents challenges...

582
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,069
...electrolyte balance lV,
caloric maintenance...

583
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:55,669
...possible pseudomonas infection.

584
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:59,369
There may be additional
risk of staph osteomyelitis.

585
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:03,268
But l think you'll be
agreeably surprised, Dr. George.

586
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,468
We can keep him alive...

587
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:08,968
...in stable vital signs, a year...

588
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,768
...two years, indefinitely.

589
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:13,968
You can't just look the other way.

590
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,968
Nobody's looking the other way.

591
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:19,368
Mark, twice in two days.
lt's not normal.

592
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,368
-ln certain cases, patients always--
-You told me that.

593
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:24,468
Two in two days.

594
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:26,568
You're just sensitized to it.

595
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:30,268
lt just happened to a friend
and now you're looking for it.

596
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:33,968
Twice in two days
is just our lousy luck.

597
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,468
-Did Harris take the readout?
-Yes.

598
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,268
All right, then forget it.

599
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,768
The hospital has
review boards and committees.

600
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,368
They'll look into it.

601
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:46,968
Now, you got a job to do,
so forget about this.

602
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:54,168
You're right. You're right.

603
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:57,968
l'll see you at dinner?

604
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,567
This is Dr. Wheeler.

605
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:28,167
l know about the conference
but l'm tied up with a patient now.

606
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,867
Well, l'm afraid l can't
make it there in time.

607
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,567
Where am l?

608
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:37,267
l'm in the emergency ward.

609
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,467
Yes, it is important.

610
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,967
Will you hold on?

611
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,667
Well, that's funny,
but all these charts you wanted...

612
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,667
...they're all signed out to Dr. George,
the chief of anesthesiology.

613
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,867
Good afternoon, Dr. George.

614
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,067
Good afternoon, staff.

615
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,467
We have a happy lab here.

616
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,267
lt's precise.
There's nothing left to chance.

617
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,367
There are no mistakes.

618
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,567
The charts are right here.
There's no mystery.

619
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,767
They're right here.
What is it you wanted?

620
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,667
l'd like to look at them.

621
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,567
For what reason?

622
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:15,166
l'm interested in unexplained coma
following routine surgery.

623
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,866
You're interested?

624
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,466
l'm more than interested.

625
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:22,066
My anesthesiology staff
is more than interested.

626
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,866
We're deeply concerned.

627
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:25,566
l understand.

628
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,466
l'm not sure you do.

629
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,666
Perhaps something was missed?

630
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,266
Missed?

631
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:35,466
Every professor of anesthesia,
most of our staff...

632
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:38,466
...more than 40 experts
have gone over these charts.

633
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,866
You think something was missed?

634
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,166
But if anything
links them together--

635
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:45,266
lf anything linked them,
we'd know it.

636
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:48,166
Here they are, 1 0 cases.
There are now 1 2.

637
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,266
Different ages and sexes.
Different surgeons and anesthetists.

638
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,466
Different methods of induction.

639
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:59,466
They share nothing in common except
they all emerged with unexplained coma.

640
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,166
We're certainly not neglecting
that problem.

641
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,666
l didn't say you were.

642
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,766
Do you mind if l have a look?

643
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,466
l'm afraid l do mind.

644
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,565
Thank you for your interest,
however misplaced.

645
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:22,865
Good afternoon.

646
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,565
Oh, my God, you did--
How could you do that?

647
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:44,565
Dr. George is a past president...

648
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:47,265
...of the American Society
of Anesthesiologists.

649
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,865
He's a member of the AAAS.
He's on the board of the NlH...

650
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,765
...and you tell him
he's doing his job wrong.

651
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:56,565
-l just wanted to see the charts.
-That's not your area.

652
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:59,765
That's not your responsibility.
You're way off base.

653
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:03,365
You know who his wife is?

654
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:05,965
-l don't care.
-Well, you should.

655
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:09,265
His wife is Amy Cabot.
She's related to Godfrey Lowell.

656
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,065
l don't care about Boston society.

657
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,665
Dr. George's wife...

658
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:16,965
...is worth somewhere between
50 and 1 00 million dollars.

659
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,265
When she dies,
that money will go somewhere.

660
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:20,665
So what?

661
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:24,465
So he has a lot of muscle here.
He's the wrong man to cross.

662
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,965
You afraid to be seen with me?

663
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:31,164
Come in.

664
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:32,864
-Hi, Bill.
-How are you?

665
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:33,864
Good.

666
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:36,464
Sit down.

667
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:42,364
You know, Mark...

668
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:46,764
...l always thought that you'd have
this job when l leave next year.

669
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:48,164
Everybody thinks so.

670
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,464
You're the logical choice.
You're a good surgeon.

671
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:53,064
You're well-organized.
You run a good service.

672
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:55,264
Well, thank you very much, Bill.

673
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:58,464
l'd hate to see anything
stand in your way.

674
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,264
You know what l mean.

675
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,464
She has the chiefs of service
in an uproar.

676
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,964
-She's under a lot of pressure.
-And so are we.

677
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:11,464
They're talking about releasing her
from her position here at the Mem.

678
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,964
But nobody really wants
that kind of...

679
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,964
...adverse publicity, that commotion.

680
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,564
Of course not.

681
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:21,064
You have influence with her?

682
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,464
l don't know. She's paranoid.

683
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:27,364
She thinks there's a conspiracy.

684
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:30,364
George keeping the charts
from her did not help.

685
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:33,064
Does she think you're involved?

686
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:37,963
No, l don't think so.

687
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:43,163
Let's hope not, Mark. What happens
to Susan may depend on you.

688
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,363
l understand that, Bill.

689
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:48,263
You know, a good chief resident...

690
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,863
...handles problems
like this every day.

691
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:56,563
l think if you're able to exert
some influence over her...

692
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:58,563
...people would be appreciative.

693
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:01,863
Well, l'll try.

694
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:04,463
Good man.

695
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:23,263
Where's Greenly?

696
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:27,563
That coma case? She was to be
transferred to the Jefferson lnstitute.

697
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:28,963
l guess she went there.

698
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:31,363
Liz, did Greenly go to Jefferson?

699
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:33,963
No, she arrested at six
this morning.

700
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,263
-She's down in pathology.
-ln pathology?

701
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:39,162
Yeah, they're probably doing
the autopsy now.

702
00:41:56,362 --> 00:41:58,362
Do you have a patient
named Greenly?

703
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:02,162
l don't know. Check in there.
l can't keep track of names.

704
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:06,862
ln microscopic section,
we may expect evidence...

705
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:09,262
...of fatty degeneration in cells...

706
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,062
...with polymorphs and histiocytes
around them.

707
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:18,262
Okay, incise the kidney there.

708
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:19,962
Looks normal.

709
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,262
Okay, remove it.

710
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:22,762
Greenly?

711
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:25,362
This is Howard.
Greenly's over there.

712
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:30,462
Hi, Jim.

713
00:42:30,662 --> 00:42:33,762
Hi, Sue. What brings you here?
lnterested in this case?

714
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:35,062
That's right.

715
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:38,062
Hell of a puzzler.
Young girl, good health...

716
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:41,662
...in for a therapeutic AB,
comes out comatose.

717
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:42,962
Found anything?

718
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,361
Naturally, we started with the brain.

719
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:49,161
Grossly, it was normal.
l'm doing a section. Want to see?

720
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,061
Ordinarily, these coma cases
get shipped to Jefferson.

721
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,361
-What's Jefferson?
-Jefferson lnstitute.

722
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:58,061
A chronic-care facility.
Government thing.

723
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:00,161
They take care of the vegetables.

724
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:03,761
Sometimes they die before
they get there, like this one.

725
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,961
More work for us.

726
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,361
Now we'll get an idea.

727
00:43:11,461 --> 00:43:15,261
We're looking for anything.
Micro-infarcts, staph loci...

728
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,861
...gross hemorrhagic areas,
congenital defects....

729
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:23,761
Nothing. Just like the
other cases, we come up cold.

730
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:25,361
l know it sounds silly...

731
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:29,861
...but if you wanted to put people
in a coma, what would you do?

732
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:31,161
On purpose?

733
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,061
Diethyl para-amino tannadol.

734
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,961
No, it leaves a serum trace.

735
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,661
-lf you look for it.
-lt also peaks alk phos.

736
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:40,161
A real giveaway.
Besides, who can get tannadol?

737
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:42,561
-Use paradine.
-lt has a taste.

738
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:46,761
We'd make great murderers.
Who knows more than a pathologist?

739
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:48,761
lt keeps my wife in line.

740
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,960
Hell of a lot of crimes
slip through our fingers.

741
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,960
But in this case, a coma.

742
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,560
First rule of crime:

743
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,060
Keep it simple.

744
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,160
What's simple?

745
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,560
Carbon monoxide.

746
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,960
Boring.

747
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,860
Carbon monoxide?

748
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,960
Sure, it's perfect.

749
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,360
Anesthetist uses carbon monoxide
instead of oxygen.

750
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,760
lt's colorless and makes the blood red
so the surgeon doesn't notice.

751
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,660
But the brain dies from lack of oxygen.
The patient doesn't wake up.

752
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,760
No other effects?

753
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,260
Sure. Cardiac irritability.

754
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Which this case had.

755
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,060
lt'd be better to block
the neuro-muscular junction...

756
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,160
...with succinylcholine.

757
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,760
-Who's gonna do it?
-Who'll feed your carbon monoxide?

758
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,260
That's the problem.

759
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,960
Been 1 2 coma cases
here in the last year.

760
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,560
They're always different.

761
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,360
Different case, different anesthetist,
different operation.

762
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,660
Hard to imagine it's murder.

763
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,660
Are you sure?

764
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,960
What do you think? There's a conspiracy
at the Boston Memorial Hospital...

765
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,860
...involving all the anesthetists?

766
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,759
<i>I've had a rather hysterical call
from Dr. George in anesthesiology.</i>

767
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:07,359
Dr. George is a powerful person here,
not only because of his position.

768
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,459
-There are other reasons.
-l gather.

769
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:12,959
What does that mean?

770
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,559
Just because he has a rich wife,
he's able to throw his weight around.

771
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,559
You're looking for truth and justice.

772
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:22,259
l'm looking for fairness.

773
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:26,159
ln fairness, you've challenged
the professional competence...

774
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,459
...of a chief of service
at this hospital.

775
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,559
And he didn't take it well.
No reason he should.

776
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:34,459
-Now he's out for blood.
-l've noticed.

777
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:37,859
Sue, believe me, l'm on your side...

778
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:40,059
...for all kinds of reasons.

779
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:43,459
l don't want to let
another chief of service...

780
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,059
...get one of
my house officers fired.

781
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:49,559
Dr. Harris, l just wanted
to look at his charts.

782
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:52,559
Sue, right now, l can protect you...

783
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:56,359
...because you're good.
And frankly, because you're a woman.

784
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,959
l don't want concessions.

785
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,259
At the moment, you'd better
take any you can get.

786
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:12,158
You know what happened to Greenly?

787
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:14,658
Yes.

788
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:17,158
What happened?

789
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:21,258
She died.

790
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,558
How do you feel about that?

791
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:27,058
How do l feel?

792
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,458
l feel....

793
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,658
She was my best friend.

794
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:38,058
She understood me.

795
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:41,558
She understood me.

796
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:55,858
lt's not fair.

797
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:58,158
None of this is fair.

798
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:01,358
Here.

799
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:05,658
Nobody understands.

800
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:08,058
-No one.
-l know, l know.

801
00:47:14,257 --> 00:47:18,657
<i>Dr. Harris, the secretary of HEW
is on the phone from Washington.</i>

802
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:19,857
Call back.

803
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,257
Too many of us shut ourselves off
from our feelings.

804
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:34,457
We don't explore them.

805
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:36,957
We don't understand them.

806
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,757
We don't understand ourselves.

807
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,557
lt's the toughest thing
about our profession.

808
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:46,857
-Dr. Harris--
-l'll take care of the politics.

809
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:49,357
You just look out for yourself.

810
00:47:50,657 --> 00:47:52,757
Take the weekend off, Sue.

811
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:56,357
Go walk on the beach.
Get away from the hospital.

812
00:47:59,357 --> 00:48:01,057
l'm so embarrassed by this.

813
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:03,557
Don't be. Don't be.

814
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,157
Our emotions are what make us human.

815
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:09,757
Come on.

816
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:12,957
Come and see me next week.

817
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,757
-Right.
-Good.

818
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:19,556
-Have a good weekend.
-Thank you, sir.

819
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:32,356
Women!

820
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:34,756
Christ!

821
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,456
God!

822
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:10,555
<i>Just say you don't believe me.</i>

823
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:14,255
A man fixed your car
so it wouldn't start...

824
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:16,655
...then followed you
into the MTA station.

825
00:50:17,155 --> 00:50:18,955
Well, it's true.

826
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,755
Your car is always breaking down.

827
00:50:27,155 --> 00:50:29,054
l just think you're tired.

828
00:50:29,754 --> 00:50:33,054
-l'm not tired.
-Why don't we go away for the weekend?

829
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:37,754
Go up the coast, have some fun
and just forget the hospital.

830
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,854
There are 1 2 coma cases.

831
00:50:43,254 --> 00:50:46,954
Nobody thinks they're linked,
but l've seen charts for two of them:

832
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,254
Nancy, and now this new guy, Murphy.

833
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:51,654
And?

834
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:54,154
And both occurred in O.R. 8.

835
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:56,354
O.R. 8?

836
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:04,954
What if carbon monoxide
were being pumped into O.R. 8?

837
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:06,954
What if that were true?

838
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,554
-Get your coat on.
-Why?

839
00:51:16,654 --> 00:51:18,454
We're going to take a look.

840
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:20,154
Right now.

841
00:51:20,654 --> 00:51:21,454
O.R. 8.

842
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:27,554
Well?

843
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:37,553
Looks okay.

844
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:44,653
-How many operations you done in here?
-A lot.

845
00:51:45,553 --> 00:51:47,153
You ever had any problems?

846
00:51:48,853 --> 00:51:50,353
Well, l already checked.

847
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:56,453
The day Nancy had her problem,
there were five other operations.

848
00:51:57,653 --> 00:52:00,353
Four before and one after.

849
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:04,453
The day Sean Murphy had his,
there were six others.

850
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,453
Two before...

851
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:08,153
...and four after.

852
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,353
They were all normal.

853
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:19,453
Let's get out of here.

854
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:46,252
This is what you call
really working for it.

855
00:52:53,152 --> 00:52:54,252
No fair.

856
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:57,752
Fair.

857
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,551
l thought we were
taking the weekend off?

858
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,851
Come on. Just a quick look.

859
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:37,751
Please?

860
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:40,051
For me?

861
00:54:42,551 --> 00:54:44,151
l don't know.

862
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,150
There doesn't seem
to be anybody around.

863
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,350
-You want to go in?
-Not really, no.

864
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:40,850
l do.

865
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:52,549
Can l help you?

866
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:54,549
l'm Dr. Wheeler.

867
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,149
-You're early, aren't you, doctor?
-Early?

868
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:02,549
You're supposed to come on Tuesday,
day after tomorrow...

869
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:04,148
...when the tour is scheduled.

870
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:05,948
The tour?

871
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:08,748
Yes, it's every Tuesday at 1 1 .

872
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:10,748
The regular tour for physicians.

873
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:14,548
Could l see it now?

874
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:17,448
l'm afraid that's impossible.

875
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,348
l just thought
as long as l'm here....

876
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:22,748
We're simply not set up for it.

877
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:26,848
May l speak with
the physician in charge?

878
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:30,048
There is no physician in charge.

879
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:32,248
Well, then, your supervisor.

880
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,548
l have no supervisor.

881
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:38,348
-Who runs the staff?
-There is no staff.

882
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:40,848
You're here alone?

883
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:44,948
Of course not. There are
technicians, security people....

884
00:57:45,748 --> 00:57:50,148
l'm sure when you've taken the tour
Tuesday, it will all be clear to you.

885
00:57:50,848 --> 00:57:52,748
What did you say your name was?

886
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,548
Dr. Wheeler. Susan Wheeler.

887
00:57:56,048 --> 00:58:00,048
We look forward to seeing you
at 1 1 on Tuesday. Goodbye.

888
00:58:47,447 --> 00:58:50,347
l heard what you said
to Dr. George...

889
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:52,047
...in the lab.

890
00:58:53,647 --> 00:58:55,647
l heard what you said to him.

891
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:57,347
You're right.

892
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,647
Right about what?

893
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:03,147
l've seen how they do it.

894
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:08,247
l know how it works.

895
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:10,547
How what works?

896
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:16,246
Do you want to scrub in
on an aortic valve replacement?

897
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:18,646
Harvey's doing one in room 1 6
in 1 0 minutes.

898
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,846
-Sure.
-Great!

899
00:59:20,046 --> 00:59:23,346
Tom was going to scrub in,
but his case is running late.

900
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:28,146
l checked them out.

901
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:31,946
You come down to maintenance tonight.
l'll show it to you.

902
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:34,946
Good morning, sir.

903
00:59:35,346 --> 00:59:37,946
-Did you have a good weekend?
-l did. Thank you.

904
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:13,946
Good evening.

905
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,146
Good evening.

906
01:00:23,845 --> 01:00:25,145
You just gonna stare at me?

907
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,145
What'd you do that for?

908
01:00:34,345 --> 01:00:36,545
They said make it look
like an accident.

909
01:00:55,145 --> 01:00:58,045
-What's happening?
-The generator will kick in.

910
01:01:01,645 --> 01:01:02,845
lKelly?

911
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:06,745
lKelly?

912
01:01:33,744 --> 01:01:35,244
What do you got now?

913
01:01:35,844 --> 01:01:36,844
Nothing.

914
01:01:38,244 --> 01:01:39,744
Try the connector cable.

915
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:43,144
l think that does it for me.
You got anything else?

916
01:01:43,344 --> 01:01:45,244
No, l don't need anything else.

917
01:01:45,644 --> 01:01:48,744
-lf we need you again--
-You can reach me at the hospital.

918
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:52,844
Must be a short in the junction box...

919
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,944
...or the step-down panel.

920
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:58,444
lt should read 1 4
point something.

921
01:01:58,944 --> 01:02:00,544
1 4.3.

922
01:02:01,044 --> 01:02:03,644
Okay, now we should have 1 1 .9.

923
01:02:04,144 --> 01:02:05,644
Eleven-nine.

924
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:07,944
And now there's--

925
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:10,144
Fourteen-three.

926
01:02:10,744 --> 01:02:12,844
Good. Nothing's shorted so far.

927
01:02:13,044 --> 01:02:14,944
We got lucky.

928
01:02:15,144 --> 01:02:16,544
Poor lKelly.

929
01:02:17,044 --> 01:02:18,544
Poor lKelly?

930
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:21,344
He got sloppy.

931
01:02:21,544 --> 01:02:23,944
You know what it is?
That drinking at lunch.

932
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:26,744
l said, ''Stop drinking.
You'll get into trouble.''

933
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:05,439
<i>Two and two's the count.
He can't get more.</i>

934
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:12,239
-What did you leave in here?
-Just some charts.

935
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:14,939
l'll call Dr. George
and tell him l let you in.

936
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:17,639
lt's all right.
l have to call him anyway.

937
01:07:17,939 --> 01:07:19,539
Well, okay.

938
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,539
-Boston ahead by one.
-That's great.

939
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,239
l've got $ 20 on this game.

940
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:11,338
What is it?

941
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:13,838
Hospital security, doctor.

942
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:26,938
-What's the score?
-Just a routine check, doctor.

943
01:08:36,538 --> 01:08:38,138
Easy, kids.

944
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,138
Jerry?

945
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:06,838
-What's going on?
-Jerry, l'm so happy to see you.

946
01:09:07,038 --> 01:09:10,137
That's the nicest thing
anybody's said to me all day.

947
01:09:11,237 --> 01:09:12,437
ls something wrong?

948
01:09:12,637 --> 01:09:15,637
You see, there's this guy.

949
01:09:15,837 --> 01:09:18,037
He said he was hospital security.

950
01:09:19,537 --> 01:09:21,937
l happen to know that he--

951
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:25,837
<i>It's a high fly ball and...</i>

952
01:09:26,737 --> 01:09:28,137
<i>...he's out!</i>

953
01:09:28,337 --> 01:09:29,237
You were saying?

954
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:32,337
l guess l have
an overactive imagination.

955
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:33,537
Be like me.

956
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,137
Everybody says l have
no imagination at all.

957
01:09:38,537 --> 01:09:41,137
l'm going over to
the medical school library.

958
01:09:41,337 --> 01:09:43,137
l'll go with you.

959
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:51,937
The tubular filtration gradient may be
more than 500 milliequivalents.

960
01:09:52,137 --> 01:09:55,737
That means there's an active
transport with phosphorylated ATP.

961
01:09:56,237 --> 01:10:01,037
But if you trace radioisotopes,
densities don't look right.

962
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:04,237
lt's a breakthrough
in understanding the kidney.

963
01:10:04,437 --> 01:10:07,937
Remember that yellow cadaver
skin under your fingernails?

964
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,837
Nobody could eat lunch.

965
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:12,037
lt seems like a long time ago.

966
01:10:12,237 --> 01:10:14,837
Back in the days
when we couldn't eat lunch.

967
01:10:17,836 --> 01:10:19,236
Wouldn't you know?

968
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:24,436
Dr. Marcus.

969
01:10:26,836 --> 01:10:28,836
Well, if he's complaining of pain.

970
01:10:29,336 --> 01:10:31,836
Try another five cc's l.M.

971
01:10:34,236 --> 01:10:37,236
l see.
Well, then MS 1 0 milligrams.

972
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:42,236
Yes, morphine sulphate.
He's not in respiratory difficulty.

973
01:10:43,936 --> 01:10:46,936
You can put him on
respiratory arrest with morphine.

974
01:10:47,236 --> 01:10:49,636
Particularly if he's on wall O-2.

975
01:10:52,736 --> 01:10:55,336
You'll have to check
and see what he's on.

976
01:10:56,936 --> 01:11:00,636
Air is fine, but oxygen....

977
01:11:02,136 --> 01:11:05,836
lf he's on wall oxygen,
tell me how many liters of flow.

978
01:11:06,836 --> 01:11:09,536
Six liters!
You can't put him on MS.

979
01:11:09,736 --> 01:11:12,136
You'll have to stay with Talwin.

980
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:17,736
Give him five cc's of water.
Say it's morphine.

981
01:11:17,936 --> 01:11:20,336
He won't know.
He's a pain in the ass anyway.

982
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,530
Mark, it's so awful!
lt's so terrible.

983
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,930
Take it easy.
Honey, slow down.

984
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,930
He was trying to kill me.
And l had to keep going.

985
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:04,530
And all the bodies.
lt's horrible!

986
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:06,030
Take it easy.
Slow down.

987
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:09,430
Mark, it's all happening.
lt's really happening.

988
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:13,930
Somebody's putting people into comas.
They're murdering them.

989
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,430
No, no, really.

990
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,830
lKelly's dead. l was down there.
l found the gas line.

991
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:25,430
lt starts in the basement
and it goes up the main tunnel...

992
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:29,930
...then plugs into the oxygen line
in the ceiling that goes to O.R. 8.

993
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:32,030
-Honey, slow down.
-They're killing people...

994
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,430
...with carbon monoxide in O.R. 8.

995
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:38,930
-They have a radio to turn the valve.
-l believe you.

996
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,930
All the cases happened in O.R. 8.

997
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:44,630
And they all went
to the Jefferson lnstitute.

998
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:50,930
And this guy, he chased me all over.
And there were so many bodies.

999
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,530
lt's all right. lt's okay.

1000
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:56,730
And this is real.
Call the police.

1001
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:01,229
We have to do something!
This is real, Mark.

1002
01:18:01,429 --> 01:18:03,029
l can prove it.

1003
01:18:03,229 --> 01:18:05,129
Sure, you can. You can.

1004
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:07,229
-Just lie down.
-This is real.

1005
01:18:07,429 --> 01:18:09,829
l know you can.
Now one thing at a time.

1006
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:12,529
l want to give you a Valium and--

1007
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:17,329
How about a cup of tea
to settle you down?

1008
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:19,329
A cup of hot tea?

1009
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:23,329
Then we're going to talk
after you settle down.

1010
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:27,729
So you just rest right here.

1011
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,229
You just stay right here
on the bed?

1012
01:18:31,429 --> 01:18:34,129
That-a-girl.
That's it. You just relax.

1013
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:35,129
l can't--

1014
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:39,229
That's it. Just relax.
Close your eyes.

1015
01:18:39,429 --> 01:18:43,429
That's it. Okay, that-a-girl.

1016
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:47,829
-Now, l'll get you a cup of tea.
-You're so great, Mark.

1017
01:18:48,129 --> 01:18:50,629
Stay here, honey.
Just stay right here.

1018
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:02,429
That's a hell of a story, Susan.

1019
01:19:04,129 --> 01:19:06,528
You really had
a lot of people worried.

1020
01:19:09,028 --> 01:19:11,828
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay now.

1021
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:27,428
She came back.

1022
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:31,128
No, she's here now.

1023
01:19:32,328 --> 01:19:35,328
Of course.
No, l can manage that.

1024
01:19:37,028 --> 01:19:38,028
l'll keep her here.

1025
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:40,728
Look, l'd better go.

1026
01:19:44,828 --> 01:19:46,628
You want some honey with your tea?

1027
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:57,027
<i>Memorial Hospital
residents' exchange.</i>

1028
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:59,827
<i>This is Dr. Wheeler.
Are there any messages for me?</i>

1029
01:21:00,227 --> 01:21:03,627
<i>Yes, doctor. Quite a few.
Just a minute, please.</i>

1030
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:09,927
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll have to call you back.</i>

1031
01:21:10,227 --> 01:21:12,427
<i>What number can you be reached at?</i>

1032
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:19,726
<i>Dr. Wheeler, are you there?
What number can we reach you at?</i>

1033
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:25,126
<i>We are dealing in
an area of uncertainty.</i>

1034
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:28,926
<i>An area where there are no rules,
contradictory laws...</i>

1035
01:21:29,126 --> 01:21:32,926
<i>...and no clear social consensus
as to what should be done.</i>

1036
01:21:33,126 --> 01:21:37,326
<i>And the cost of care for the chronic
patient has become prohibitive.</i>

1037
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:41,726
<i>This is particularly the case
with the long-term comatose patient.</i>

1038
01:21:41,926 --> 01:21:46,326
The Jefferson lnstitute is a government-
sponsored experimental facility...

1039
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:50,726
...designed to provide quality
life support to the comatose patient.

1040
01:21:51,426 --> 01:21:52,826
l wish to emphasize...

1041
01:21:53,026 --> 01:21:56,626
...no moral or ethical position
is being taken here.

1042
01:21:56,926 --> 01:22:00,926
We do not participate in the debate
over whether these patients...

1043
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:02,326
...are alive or dead...

1044
01:22:02,926 --> 01:22:06,226
...or whether their care should
be continued or terminated.

1045
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:10,626
Society will decide if there will
be more of these facilities or not.

1046
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:16,126
ln the meantime, we merely provide
care as inexpensively as possible.

1047
01:22:16,326 --> 01:22:18,726
Now, if you will
please come this way....

1048
01:22:19,626 --> 01:22:21,326
This is our visiting room...

1049
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:24,725
...where relatives can see patients
who are stored here.

1050
01:22:24,925 --> 01:22:26,925
You see, it all looks quite normal.

1051
01:22:27,425 --> 01:22:29,425
We've found it is inadvisable...

1052
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:33,825
...for relatives to know the actual
circumstances of patient care.

1053
01:22:34,025 --> 01:22:37,125
lt's too much of a shock.
So we bring the patient here.

1054
01:22:37,325 --> 01:22:40,825
After the visit, we return them
to the main care facility.

1055
01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:44,425
lf you will put on your glasses,
we'll go there now.

1056
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,825
This is our main care facility.

1057
01:22:48,025 --> 01:22:50,925
Temperature here is
94.7 degrees Fahrenheit...

1058
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:53,325
...humidity 82 percent.

1059
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:56,625
This stability reduces
patient heat loss...

1060
01:22:56,825 --> 01:22:58,825
...and caloric requirements.

1061
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:03,225
There's a low-level ultraviolet
bacteriostatic flux...

1062
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:05,125
...and to prevent bedsores...

1063
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:08,425
...patients are suspended
by wires through long bones.

1064
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:12,425
-How do you get to them up there?
-There's no need for contact.

1065
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:16,525
Every one of our patients is
individually monitored by the computer.

1066
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:20,925
lndwelling telemetry records weight,
fluid balance...

1067
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:24,825
...blood pressure, blood gases,
temperature, metabolic balance.

1068
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:29,824
Our computer makes an immediate
adjustment for any change in condition.

1069
01:23:30,024 --> 01:23:31,224
For example...

1070
01:23:32,024 --> 01:23:36,824
...we simulate hypotension by direct
compression of the telemetry unit.

1071
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:40,924
The computer will sense this
and make an immediate adjustment.

1072
01:23:46,424 --> 01:23:48,624
Well, almost immediate.

1073
01:23:50,924 --> 01:23:53,024
Sometimes there's a--

1074
01:23:53,524 --> 01:23:55,224
There we are.

1075
01:23:55,624 --> 01:23:58,624
Sometimes there is a short delay,
but as you can see...

1076
01:23:58,824 --> 01:24:01,724
...the computer put the patient
in the Trendelenburg position...

1077
01:24:01,924 --> 01:24:04,224
...and administered a vasoconstrictor.

1078
01:24:04,824 --> 01:24:08,724
We have very few crises here.
With the assistance of technology...

1079
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:11,524
...these patients
are maintained beautifully.

1080
01:24:11,724 --> 01:24:14,924
Without it,
they would have died long ago.

1081
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:19,224
But the law says they must be
maintained, and this is one solution.

1082
01:24:19,824 --> 01:24:21,724
How large is your staff?

1083
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:23,824
One nurse, a physician on call...

1084
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:27,624
...two computer technicians and
a small security staff. That's all.

1085
01:24:27,824 --> 01:24:29,224
And the rest of the building?

1086
01:24:29,424 --> 01:24:32,924
lt's of no interest. Just mechanical
and technical facilities.

1087
01:24:33,224 --> 01:24:34,124
What's the cost?

1088
01:24:34,323 --> 01:24:37,523
For each patient, about $ 60 a day.

1089
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:42,423
But we can store 1 ,000 patients
and then the cost will go down.

1090
01:24:42,623 --> 01:24:46,723
We expect to maintain patients
for about $5 a day.

1091
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:50,323
Less than it costs to hire
a baby-sitter for a few hours.

1092
01:24:50,623 --> 01:24:52,623
lf there are
no further questions...

1093
01:24:52,823 --> 01:24:56,123
...this concludes our tour
of the Jefferson lnstitute.

1094
01:24:56,323 --> 01:24:59,923
Before you go, we have some literature
we'd like you to take.

1095
01:25:00,123 --> 01:25:04,123
lt explains some of the background
and details of our work here.

1096
01:25:04,323 --> 01:25:06,323
We hope the tour has been informative.

1097
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:10,423
And if you have any questions
about the Jefferson lnstitute...

1098
01:25:10,623 --> 01:25:12,223
...don't hesitate to call.

1099
01:25:12,423 --> 01:25:13,923
lt shouldn't be about money.

1100
01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:17,123
Maybe your patients don't
complain about their bills.

1101
01:25:17,423 --> 01:25:18,923
Thank you for your interest.

1102
01:25:19,123 --> 01:25:20,223
Goodbye.

1103
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:29,622
Do you know what l wanted?

1104
01:26:29,822 --> 01:26:32,022
l wanted corned beef on rye...

1105
01:26:32,222 --> 01:26:35,722
...or else a roast beef with Russian.
And what do you bring me?

1106
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:37,422
Ham and cheese.

1107
01:26:37,622 --> 01:26:39,422
Well, that's all they had.

1108
01:26:39,722 --> 01:26:43,122
You mean to tell me
they didn't have any corned beef?

1109
01:26:43,322 --> 01:26:45,122
That's what the man said.

1110
01:26:45,322 --> 01:26:48,721
No corned beef. The guy must
have been putting you on.

1111
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:55,921
George says we're having an electrical
inspection tomorrow morning.

1112
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,721
Are we set for that?

1113
01:26:57,921 --> 01:26:59,121
Norman!

1114
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:00,821
Yes, we should be.

1115
01:27:01,021 --> 01:27:04,121
-Do you want the bidding program now?
-ln a moment.

1116
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:09,321
Did you see the game last night?
Two out, Bumbry's up.

1117
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,421
He hits a ball to left field.

1118
01:27:11,621 --> 01:27:14,821
White misses it
and goes for a triple.

1119
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,421
Lungs, 1 1 00 grams.

1120
01:27:18,221 --> 01:27:20,621
lKidneys, 780, 620.

1121
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:23,721
Eighty and six-twenty.

1122
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,221
What about the heart?

1123
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:29,821
-l wrote it down someplace.
-What's the temperature?

1124
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:32,321
Right now, 1 2 degrees centigrade...

1125
01:27:32,521 --> 01:27:35,121
...and all the rest at 1 4.

1126
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,220
Where's that heart going?

1127
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,220
San Francisco.

1128
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,720
l think they're getting
$ 75,000 for it.

1129
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:08,020
-ls that all?
-lt was a bad match on tissue-typing.

1130
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,820
Only two out of four.
But it's a rush order.

1131
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,020
The kidney's a four-tissue match
and in perfect condition.

1132
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,320
They'll get 200 grand for that.

1133
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,920
lt's going to Texas.
A millionaire's son.

1134
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,220
Good old George has the connections.

1135
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:24,620
So far, George is doing fine.
What about the other kidney?

1136
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:27,720
They're putting it up for bids.
They'll get 1 00 for it.

1137
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,920
We have a left kidney,
two hours old, ready to ship.

1138
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,020
lt's a 4-3-6-7.
A 31 -year-old male.

1139
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,920
The bidding now stands
at forty-two five.

1140
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,220
Thank you.

1141
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,520
Forty-five.

1142
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,020
lt's at 45.

1143
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,220
Well, it could be in Zurich in....

1144
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,120
The fastest routing is New York-Rome.
lt'll arrive local time...

1145
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,920
... 1 300 hours, which means
elapsed time is 23 hours.

1146
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,720
Twenty-three hours elapsed time,
which would make it 1 p.m. your time.

1147
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,019
That's the best we can do.

1148
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:00,419
Thank you.

1149
01:29:08,519 --> 01:29:09,319
What's that?

1150
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:12,519
Look at monitor four.

1151
01:29:16,019 --> 01:29:16,819
All units!

1152
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,119
<i>All units!</i>

1153
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,519
<i>There is an unauthorized woman
in the building.</i>

1154
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:23,519
Let's take her alive.

1155
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:29,219
<i>Visiting room, clear.</i>

1156
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:32,619
<i>Second floor lobby, clear.</i>

1157
01:29:33,019 --> 01:29:35,919
<i>Has anyone checked
the main care facility?</i>

1158
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:38,719
<i>We have no report from that sector.</i>

1159
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:55,019
Now on the second floor corridor.

1160
01:30:31,518 --> 01:30:33,518
Don't you have a key to this place?

1161
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:44,818
<i>Repeat: No intruders
on sub-basement one.</i>

1162
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:48,518
Unit one, she's out on the ledge.
lt's too far for her to jump.

1163
01:30:53,418 --> 01:30:54,718
l don't see her.

1164
01:30:54,918 --> 01:30:58,218
She's out there.
She won't get far. We got her now.

1165
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:02,218
Have the dogs start on the north side
and circle the building.

1166
01:31:02,418 --> 01:31:05,418
l want security at all exits.
Notify them by radio.

1167
01:31:05,618 --> 01:31:09,918
Search the labs and the roof.
l've had enough of this inefficiency.

1168
01:31:10,717 --> 01:31:13,417
<i>Perimeter dog team, come in.
Repeat. Come in!</i>

1169
01:31:58,717 --> 01:32:02,217
<i>Main control, any readings
from outside? Where are the dogs?</i>

1170
01:32:25,016 --> 01:32:27,216
<i>I don't know where the hell she is.</i>

1171
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:29,816
<i>She's got to be around here somewhere.</i>

1172
01:32:42,316 --> 01:32:44,116
There, there.

1173
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:47,616
lt's going to be all right.

1174
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:51,716
lt's going to be all right.

1175
01:33:17,016 --> 01:33:19,416
<i>First floor lobby, check in.</i>

1176
01:33:19,816 --> 01:33:22,216
<i>First floor lobby, please respond.</i>

1177
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:24,415
No, she's not here.

1178
01:33:24,815 --> 01:33:26,815
Of course l've been notified.

1179
01:33:27,815 --> 01:33:29,615
l'm keeping an eye out for her.

1180
01:33:30,015 --> 01:33:34,215
lf she comes here, we'll get her.
There's no way she can escape.

1181
01:33:55,515 --> 01:33:57,515
Let's get this loaded quick.

1182
01:33:57,815 --> 01:34:00,815
l got to make it in time
for the Dallas flight.

1183
01:34:01,015 --> 01:34:03,115
And we got rush-hour traffic.

1184
01:34:03,315 --> 01:34:06,215
Even with the siren,
l gotta get through the tunnel.

1185
01:34:06,915 --> 01:34:09,615
Life gets tougher all the time.

1186
01:34:10,615 --> 01:34:12,015
l see you got the dogs out.

1187
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:15,615
-We got a little security problem.
-We all got problems.

1188
01:34:15,815 --> 01:34:17,815
World's full of problems.

1189
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,415
Take it away!

1190
01:35:22,314 --> 01:35:23,514
Do me a favor.

1191
01:35:24,414 --> 01:35:26,514
Don't say anything to upset her.

1192
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:28,114
l wouldn't say anything.

1193
01:35:28,314 --> 01:35:30,714
She's an old woman. She's sick.

1194
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,114
-She may die.
-Did the doctor say that?

1195
01:35:33,314 --> 01:35:36,613
-l don't know.
-You don't know what the doctor said?

1196
01:35:37,113 --> 01:35:40,713
-l'll believe what the doctor says.
-Just don't upset her.

1197
01:35:41,613 --> 01:35:42,913
This could be it.

1198
01:35:43,313 --> 01:35:44,513
This could be the end.

1199
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:50,613
lt's incredible.

1200
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,813
Well, l could use a drink.
How about you? Scotch?

1201
01:35:57,213 --> 01:35:58,613
Whatever you're having.

1202
01:35:58,813 --> 01:36:01,413
l like a woman who drinks Scotch.

1203
01:36:04,913 --> 01:36:06,613
You've done a remarkable thing.

1204
01:36:07,513 --> 01:36:09,113
Your dedication...

1205
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:11,313
...your concern...

1206
01:36:12,013 --> 01:36:14,413
...your pursuit of this problem.

1207
01:36:15,413 --> 01:36:17,713
lt's all extremely impressive.

1208
01:36:18,913 --> 01:36:20,213
And l'm very grateful.

1209
01:36:20,913 --> 01:36:23,113
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

1210
01:36:27,813 --> 01:36:30,313
ln fact, l'm more than grateful.

1211
01:36:31,013 --> 01:36:32,913
l'm deeply in your debt.

1212
01:36:34,913 --> 01:36:37,013
The question is,
how do we handle this?

1213
01:36:37,413 --> 01:36:39,313
You arrest Dr. George.

1214
01:36:43,912 --> 01:36:46,212
<i>Sorry, Dr. Harris.
It's Landis in Washington.</i>

1215
01:36:46,612 --> 01:36:47,712
Put him on.

1216
01:36:48,012 --> 01:36:49,512
Excuse me.

1217
01:36:52,512 --> 01:36:53,912
Hello, Tom. How are you?

1218
01:36:55,012 --> 01:36:57,212
Fine, fine, just fine.

1219
01:36:58,412 --> 01:37:00,512
Sure, l'd be delighted to testify.

1220
01:37:00,712 --> 01:37:03,312
You know how strongly l feel
about the matter.

1221
01:37:03,512 --> 01:37:05,712
But have you consulted
the president?

1222
01:37:07,512 --> 01:37:08,512
l see.

1223
01:37:09,712 --> 01:37:10,912
This won't take long.

1224
01:37:25,712 --> 01:37:28,012
Good, good.

1225
01:37:34,512 --> 01:37:36,112
Good. Thanks for calling.

1226
01:37:43,312 --> 01:37:46,711
You've put me in a difficult position.

1227
01:37:48,211 --> 01:37:49,911
lt seems you know everything.

1228
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:56,711
You're George.

1229
01:37:57,011 --> 01:37:59,611
l wonder if you can understand...

1230
01:38:00,611 --> 01:38:03,811
...if you can take the long view...

1231
01:38:05,111 --> 01:38:08,711
...the view of a person in my position.

1232
01:38:13,311 --> 01:38:14,611
You did it?

1233
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:17,611
No decision is easy.

1234
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:20,711
lt only looks that way
when you're young.

1235
01:38:21,711 --> 01:38:23,411
When you're older...

1236
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:26,611
...everything is complicated.

1237
01:38:27,311 --> 01:38:29,611
There is no black and white.

1238
01:38:29,811 --> 01:38:31,511
Only gray.

1239
01:38:33,311 --> 01:38:36,211
But our society faces
momentous decisions.

1240
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:39,911
Decisions about the right to die...

1241
01:38:40,311 --> 01:38:43,111
...about abortion,
about terminal illness...

1242
01:38:43,311 --> 01:38:46,211
...prolonged coma, transplantation.

1243
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:49,311
Decisions about life and death.

1244
01:38:49,511 --> 01:38:51,711
But society isn't deciding.

1245
01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:54,810
Congress isn't deciding.
The courts aren't deciding.

1246
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:57,210
Religion isn't deciding. Why?

1247
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:01,510
Because society is leaving it
up to us, the experts.

1248
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,910
The doctors.

1249
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:06,110
You're crazy.

1250
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:10,210
Americans spend $ 1 25 billion
a year on health.

1251
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,710
More than defense.

1252
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:15,110
Because Americans believe
in medical care.

1253
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:20,010
These great hospital complexes
are the cathedrals of our age.

1254
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:23,710
Billions of dollars,
thousands of beds...

1255
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:28,510
...a whole nation of sick people
turning to us for help.

1256
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:37,410
You ought to see somebody.

1257
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:39,810
They're children, Sue.

1258
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:41,810
They trust us.

1259
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,310
We can't tell them everything.

1260
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:50,810
Our job is to make things easier
for them. l'm sure you agree.

1261
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:53,610
You're killing people.

1262
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:57,610
We must always take the long view...

1263
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,309
...not of the individual,
but of society as a whole...

1264
01:40:02,509 --> 01:40:06,809
...because medicine is now
a great social force.

1265
01:40:07,509 --> 01:40:10,609
The individual is too small.

1266
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:21,609
That's the drug.

1267
01:40:22,209 --> 01:40:26,509
lt produces abdominal spasm
and peritoneal symptoms.

1268
01:40:27,509 --> 01:40:29,209
lt must be very painful.

1269
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:32,909
lt's too bad.

1270
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:37,709
But look at it from
the practical standpoint.

1271
01:40:38,009 --> 01:40:42,409
Somebody has to make these decisions.
We can't wait around forever.

1272
01:40:42,809 --> 01:40:45,009
lf society won't decide,
we'll decide.

1273
01:40:45,209 --> 01:40:47,009
We'll make the hard decisions.

1274
01:40:54,609 --> 01:40:56,209
This is Dr. Harris.

1275
01:40:56,409 --> 01:41:00,309
Schedule an emergency
appendectomy in O.R. 8.

1276
01:41:01,009 --> 01:41:03,109
lt's a member of the house staff,
Dr. Wheeler.

1277
01:41:03,309 --> 01:41:06,008
l've examined her.
She requires immediate surgery.

1278
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:07,708
Okay, honey, now just sit up.

1279
01:41:07,908 --> 01:41:10,408
Come on, that's it.
That's good.

1280
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:13,908
Here we go.

1281
01:41:14,808 --> 01:41:15,908
lt's...

1282
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,208
...the drug.

1283
01:41:19,608 --> 01:41:21,208
Doctors make the worst patients.

1284
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:23,408
They know too much, l guess.

1285
01:41:37,908 --> 01:41:39,608
Why'd you run away?

1286
01:41:40,108 --> 01:41:43,408
l was just talking to your mother.
She was worried about you.

1287
01:41:43,608 --> 01:41:45,808
Everybody's been worried about you.

1288
01:41:50,308 --> 01:41:51,908
Honey, l love you.

1289
01:41:52,808 --> 01:41:54,208
You're gonna be just fine.

1290
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,208
No, Mark, listen.

1291
01:41:56,508 --> 01:41:58,308
You have to stop this.

1292
01:41:58,508 --> 01:42:01,108
l'm fine. l am.

1293
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,608
But your appendix is not fine.

1294
01:42:04,908 --> 01:42:08,208
You've got plus-four peritonitis,
guarding and spasm, honey.

1295
01:42:08,408 --> 01:42:10,208
Susan, you do.

1296
01:42:10,508 --> 01:42:11,907
No, l don't.

1297
01:42:13,907 --> 01:42:15,707
There's no question about it.

1298
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:22,907
Check my white count
and sed. rate. lt's normal.

1299
01:42:23,607 --> 01:42:25,107
Please.

1300
01:42:33,307 --> 01:42:35,207
The tests aren't here.

1301
01:42:36,907 --> 01:42:40,407
But with these physical signs,
it has to be appendicitis.

1302
01:42:40,607 --> 01:42:41,407
Please!

1303
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:44,007
lt's better to be safe
and have the operation.

1304
01:42:44,607 --> 01:42:46,307
Besides, you're in the best of hands.

1305
01:42:46,507 --> 01:42:49,907
Dr. Harris himself will do
the procedure. How about that?

1306
01:42:50,207 --> 01:42:52,107
The chief of surgery
is taking your case.

1307
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:53,507
l don't want him.

1308
01:42:53,707 --> 01:42:57,307
-Well, how's our patient doing?
-Fine. Just slightly delirious.

1309
01:42:57,507 --> 01:43:00,107
That's normal with appendicitis.

1310
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:03,307
Besides, we all know doctors
make the worst patients.

1311
01:43:03,607 --> 01:43:04,807
You gonna scrub in?

1312
01:43:05,007 --> 01:43:08,407
Dr. Harris, we have O.R. 7
ready for your case.

1313
01:43:08,607 --> 01:43:10,407
l wanted O.R. 8.

1314
01:43:10,607 --> 01:43:12,207
lt isn't ready yet.

1315
01:43:12,407 --> 01:43:16,906
-l specifically requested O.R. 8.
-lt'll take a couple of minutes.

1316
01:43:17,106 --> 01:43:20,806
Well, hurry it up. Our patient
can't wait all night, can she?

1317
01:43:22,306 --> 01:43:23,306
You scrubbing in?

1318
01:43:24,206 --> 01:43:27,106
Excuse me.
Let me just answer this page, sir.

1319
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,706
Yeah, this is Dr. Bellows.

1320
01:43:34,906 --> 01:43:35,906
<i>Yes, Dr. Bellows.</i>

1321
01:43:36,206 --> 01:43:37,206
lt's that serious?

1322
01:43:37,606 --> 01:43:39,506
<i>Is what that serious?</i>

1323
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:41,206
l'll be right there.

1324
01:43:41,406 --> 01:43:43,006
<i>Dr. Bellows?</i>

1325
01:43:45,806 --> 01:43:47,606
We're ready in O.R. 8.

1326
01:43:47,806 --> 01:43:49,306
We'll start at once.

1327
01:43:49,506 --> 01:43:50,606
Bellows?

1328
01:43:50,906 --> 01:43:53,006
Patient on surgical two's
got convulsions.

1329
01:43:53,206 --> 01:43:55,206
Join me as soon as you can.

1330
01:43:55,506 --> 01:43:57,206
You can take her in.

1331
01:43:57,906 --> 01:44:01,706
You certainly are lucky
with Dr. Harris doing the operation.

1332
01:44:02,006 --> 01:44:04,406
Couldn't ask for a better man, huh?

1333
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,306
-l want--
-Now, now, just lie there.

1334
01:44:06,606 --> 01:44:09,406
You're going to have a nice sleep.
Just relax.

1335
01:44:09,806 --> 01:44:11,606
Easy, we'll take good care of you.

1336
01:44:12,606 --> 01:44:15,906
<i>I found the oxygen line.
It starts in the basement...</i>

1337
01:44:16,106 --> 01:44:18,006
<i>...and it goes up the main tunnel...</i>

1338
01:44:18,206 --> 01:44:21,706
<i>...and then it plugs in the ceiling
that goes to O.R. 8.</i>

1339
01:44:26,705 --> 01:44:28,305
Do we have enough sponges?

1340
01:44:28,505 --> 01:44:32,205
We better order some more
4-0 Chromex. We're almost out.

1341
01:44:53,105 --> 01:44:55,405
We have to do this one right.

1342
01:44:56,005 --> 01:45:00,905
House officers deserve the very best
of care in their own hospital.

1343
01:45:05,905 --> 01:45:09,505
l'm giving you Pentothal.
Take some good, deep breaths, dear.

1344
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,005
ln and out.

1345
01:45:34,304 --> 01:45:35,804
The patient's film.

1346
01:45:36,604 --> 01:45:38,204
They look normal, don't they?

1347
01:45:38,504 --> 01:45:42,804
Pity acute appendicitis doesn't
show up more clearly in the x-rays.

1348
01:45:50,504 --> 01:45:51,904
She has an inny.

1349
01:45:52,104 --> 01:45:53,304
A what?

1350
01:45:53,504 --> 01:45:56,004
An inny. The bellybutton.

1351
01:45:56,304 --> 01:45:58,904
Some are innies, some are outties.
Hers is an inny.

1352
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:19,704
Let me know when she's fully under.

1353
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:26,804
She's ready for you.

1354
01:46:27,604 --> 01:46:28,404
Scalpel, please.

1355
01:47:15,403 --> 01:47:16,303
What's that?

1356
01:47:16,503 --> 01:47:18,103
lt's a PVC.

1357
01:47:19,803 --> 01:47:20,803
There's another one.

1358
01:47:21,403 --> 01:47:22,603
Too light?

1359
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:24,203
l don't think so, sir.

1360
01:47:25,003 --> 01:47:26,703
Maybe you'd better deepen anesthesia.

1361
01:47:37,503 --> 01:47:40,003
Blood pressure's dropping.
l don't understand.

1362
01:47:40,903 --> 01:47:42,502
Want me to stop?

1363
01:47:44,302 --> 01:47:45,302
lt'll be all right.

1364
01:47:45,902 --> 01:47:50,002
-l'll be happy to stop a moment.
-lt's okay, Dr. Harris.

1365
01:47:50,402 --> 01:47:51,702
You recommend l go on?

1366
01:48:07,902 --> 01:48:10,602
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1367
01:48:12,702 --> 01:48:14,102
Here it is.

1368
01:48:17,102 --> 01:48:19,502
Looks normal.
Never know it from her symptoms.

1369
01:48:19,802 --> 01:48:22,702
lt's nice to see the chief
get caught sometimes.

1370
01:48:23,502 --> 01:48:25,002
Happens to the best of us.

1371
01:48:41,902 --> 01:48:42,902
All right.

1372
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,502
-You can bring her out now.
-Right.

1373
01:48:56,101 --> 01:48:58,101
She's not coming around.

1374
01:48:58,401 --> 01:49:01,501
Just give her a minute.
l'm sure she'll be fine.

1375
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:02,701
l don't know.

1376
01:49:14,301 --> 01:49:15,801
She's okay, sir.

1377
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:18,501
She's just fine, Dr. Harris.

1378
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,401
Nice case, Dr. Harris.

1379
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,100
-Don't let him do the operation.
-l know, baby.

1380
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,200
l know.

1381
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,500
We're waiting for you, Dr. Harris.
