1
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,992
-911.
-Please, please, help me!

2
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,029
I'm at 408, Hazelwood Drive.

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,149
Ma'am?

4
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,669
No!

5
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,471
Jeez, 6:30 in the morning.
What a way to start the day!

6
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,478
-You promised me an easy day, Rodgers.
-Yeah, well, I forgot to read my horoscope.

7
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,832
What's up, boys?

8
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,511
What do you got for me, boys?

9
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,955
Neighbours called, said they heard
a bunch of fighting, screaming.

10
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,713
All kinds of carrying on
going up here and....

11
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,955
-When would that have been, Carter?
-Let me see. I got that here somewhere.

12
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,713
Three hours ago, sir.

13
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,998
Get this, the old lady across the street said
she saw a masked man fleeing the scene.

14
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,838
Said it looked like a ninja.

15
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,038
Jesus H!

16
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,111
Would you look at this?

17
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,869
Multiple gunshots are one thing, but this....

18
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,190
By the way this was done,
this had to be personal.

19
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,433
Look at the patience he took in doing this.
Like he was carving a frigging turkey.

20
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,716
Hey, Rodgers, get in here.

21
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,472
You go. I'll take care of this.

22
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,591
All right, Carter. What do you have?

23
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,795
Damn!

24
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,676
Miss, are you all right?

25
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,516
How many fingers do you see?

26
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,198
Miss, I have a dead body in the other room
and no explanation.

27
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,110
Dead body.

28
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,192
Now, I need to ask this woman
a few questions.

29
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,429
Fine.

30
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,549
-Come with me, miss.
-Where are we going?

31
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,355
Down to the station.
To answer some questions.

32
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,559
No. Where's my husband?

33
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,592
Your husband is dead, ma'am.

34
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,269
No!

35
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,871
Calm down. It's going to be okay.

36
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,871
Carter, take her to the squad car.

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,879
No!

38
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,755
Leave me alone!

39
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,751
-Please, calm down.
-No!

40
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,592
Lady, you don't want to go there.

41
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,632
Anderson! Call SVU.
We got a situation here.

42
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,390
-Dr. Dubois. Always right on time.
-That's my job.

43
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,438
Tammy, my name is Mia. I'm a doctor.

44
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,477
-Can we talk for a while?
-I don't want to talk.

45
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,149
Okay, I can understand that totally.

46
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,114
But the only way we can resolve this
situation is if we can talk things through.

47
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,391
Can we talk for a little while?

48
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,239
These men.

49
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,438
Make them leave.

50
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,469
Okay.

51
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,436
-Tammy.
-Stay away from me.

52
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,034
All right. But I'm just here to help you.

53
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,715
All I want you to do is tell me
what you've been through.

54
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,595
You can trust me.

55
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,436
These men. They want to hurt me.

56
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,714
That's not true.
No one's here to bother you.

57
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,518
Then you make them leave.

58
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,115
All right. What if I have them step back?

59
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,189
All the way back against the wall.
Will that be okay?

60
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,518
That's better, isn't it?

61
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,234
Yes, it is.

62
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,950
Okay.

63
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,318
I'm going to walk over to you.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

64
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,469
Believe me.

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,029
Okay, and now
I am going to walk towards you...

66
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,755
...and I'm going to listen.
I'll sit down next to you and listen...

67
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,310
...and I want you to tell me
whatever is on your heart.

68
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,430
I'm going to listen
to whatever it is you have to say.

69
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,991
He treated me like....

70
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,672
It's okay.

71
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,679
It's going to be okay.

72
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,196
We'll fix it. It's going to be okay.

73
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,519
-No!
-Come on.

74
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,716
-No!
-Come on. Don't struggle.

75
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,119
I said careful!

76
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,428
Where's my husband?

77
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,113
Come on, come on now.

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,399
What did you say to her?

79
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,951
Same thing I always do.

80
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,710
Whatever they need to hear
to make them feel safe.

81
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,311
-Good job.
-Thanks.

82
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,076
Micky, I feel like
you're making great progress.

83
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,119
But I still feel like you're holding back.

84
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,509
Are you?

85
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,516
Yes.

86
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,835
Kind of.

87
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,472
Well, that's a start.
Honesty is always good.

88
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,430
-Yeah? Are you always honest?
-Sure.

89
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,029
I try to be.

90
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,112
You hesitated, Doctor.

91
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,430
See? You may have been lying right there.

92
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,351
Personally, I think the truth is overrated,
don't you?

93
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,712
Patient is showing minute change
with regards to the March 2000 incident.

94
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,677
He can't bring himself to speak the words...

95
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,392
...attack, assault, battery.

96
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,790
He does realise his wrongdoings,
but he can't seem to truly grasp them.

97
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,879
Patient also wants to revive his love life.

98
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,673
His need for a relationship
underscores his desires...

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,872
...to be wanted and loved.

100
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,036
-Who is it?
-The Girl Scouts. We got cookies.

101
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,157
Whatever it is you are selling,
I am not buying.

102
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,956
-A little office warming.
-Oh, Rodgers!

103
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,599
-Thank you.
-Sure. Anytime.

104
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,352
Dr. Feelgood.

105
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,197
-Oh, what's it been, only a month?
-Two months.

106
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,870
Two months in private practise
and you're already high-rolling.

107
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,598
I wouldn't say all that.

108
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,478
What do we have over here?
What's this? DVD player?

109
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,834
Sure is.

110
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,473
Another new gadget?

111
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,556
They had the audio cassette replace
the 8-track, and the CD replace that one?

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,118
Don't forget about the VCR
to the Betamax.

113
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,636
Now, look, Doc,
I'm really glad to see you doing well.

114
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,709
But I got to tell you, you don't come
around the station anymore.

115
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,199
We miss you downtown.

116
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,837
Working at the department
was a little too much for me.

117
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,197
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

118
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,638
We teach her all that good cop stuff,
then what does she do?

119
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,315
She throws us over
for a lousy $100 an hour in a posh office.

120
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,389
Shady.

121
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,559
Okay, fellows.

122
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,951
You want to tell me
to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

123
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,833
It's the Racine case.

124
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,480
Remember, last one you did
with the gun-toting wife?

125
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,711
These are the facts: Lance Racine is dead.

126
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,356
Nothing was taken from the house,
so it doesn't look like robbery.

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,314
His wife of six months is still alive.

128
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,319
She was set to receive
a hefty insurance payment...

129
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,311
...from his life insurance policy.

130
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,315
Unfortunately for her,
Lance forgot to list her as a beneficiary.

131
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,595
Okay. So where do I come in?

132
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,555
Tammy is going to be released
from hospital care in two weeks.

133
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,949
Now, at that point in time...

134
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,670
...she has the right to choose
her own psychological caregiver.

135
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,672
I don't know what you said to her
the night of the murder...

136
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,753
...but she feels very comfortable with you,
because she has requested you.

137
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,393
-Me?
-Yeah.

138
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,358
We were hoping you could take her
as a client and hook us up.

139
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,351
You mean pump her for information?

140
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,429
Guys, that violates
my doctor-patient confidentiality.

141
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,479
-Both you guys know that.
-Come on, man, don't go holy on me now.

142
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,518
-We need your help.
-We really do.

143
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,796
I mean if she suddenly comes into money,
I want you to let us know.

144
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,358
I'm sorry,
I can't help you guys out with this one.

145
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,474
I'm sorry, too.

146
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,629
Hey.

147
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,319
Did you say something?

148
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,309
Yeah.

149
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,912
Working the stock market again?

150
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,349
Yeah, baby.

151
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,956
You know my job is never done.

152
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,032
I need a minute.
I need to ask you something.

153
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,153
Can it wait till later?

154
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,511
I've really got to get this done.

155
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,629
Right.

156
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,028
-Victor?
-Mia, what?

157
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,393
Remember the case I had
a few months ago?

158
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,991
The one with the lady...

159
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,753
...that had a murdered husband?

160
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,150
Yeah. I think I do remember.

161
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,916
Well, she's going to be my new client.

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,718
Rodgers and Anderson came by.

163
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,360
They want me to feed them information
from our sessions.

164
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,715
That would be potential career suicide.

165
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,558
But they do have a way
of keeping things anonymous.

166
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,673
I don't know what to do.

167
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,714
You know I have a soft spot for....

168
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,589
Victor!

169
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,988
Yeah, baby. Just...

170
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,355
...just give me one hour and I'm all yours.

171
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,754
I promise, okay?

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,435
Sure.

173
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,478
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,834
-Mick, what are you doing here?
-Did I frighten you?

175
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,514
I would never ever want to scare you.

176
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,073
-It's fine, Micky.
-Look, I didn't want to be a bother.

177
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,119
I couldn't sleep last night.
I came here early this morning.

178
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,829
I need to see you.
I need to set up a meeting.

179
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,114
I have a 10:00.

180
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,670
Please.

181
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,508
I'll tell you what:

182
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,989
If you wait in the lounge...

183
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,671
...I'll fit you in afterward, okay?

184
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,033
Thank you, Doctor.

185
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,039
-Dr. Dubois?
-Yes, Catherine.

186
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,109
There's a Tammy Racine here to see you.
She says it's important.

187
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,274
Send her right in.

188
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,433
Let's talk.

189
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,754
There's something you want to tell me,
isn't it?

190
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,955
If there's something you want to say,
you can. Whatever it is.

191
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,471
Now that I'm actually here, I don't know.

192
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,799
I thought I was ready to talk about it, but...

193
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,469
...I guess not.

194
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,356
I think I need a little more time.

195
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,829
Okay. That's fine.

196
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,836
Let's talk about today.
Just today. How was your day?

197
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,279
Okay, I guess.

198
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,229
Okay, I'll tell you about my day.

199
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,799
Look, I'm not crazy.

200
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,199
And I'm not a child.

201
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,391
So you don't have to talk to me like that.

202
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,356
You know, maybe this was a mistake.

203
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,195
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

204
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,908
Are you sure? Tammy, you came to me.

205
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,158
Yeah, I know. But maybe some other time.

206
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,511
-Catherine?
-Yes, Dr. Dubois.

207
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,398
Please stop Miss Racine
and schedule an appointment...

208
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,391
...for later this week.

209
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,229
-Right away.
-Thank you.

210
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,875
New patient Tammy Racine.
Entry number one.

211
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,517
I'm standing here with
the Atlantic Police Chief Brenda Walker.

212
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,670
Chief Walker, since you've taken office...

213
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,116
...you've helped reduce city crime
by 17 percent.

214
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,634
How have you done this
at a time when the economy...

215
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,950
...is in a slump
and unemployment is rising?

216
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,237
We reduced crime by creating a series
of community-based programmes.

217
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,869
-Hello?
-Hey, lady. It's me. Hampton.

218
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,869
What do you want?

219
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,394
-Damn, don't you want to talk to me?
-No.

220
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,599
-No?
-That's right. "No." Okay?

221
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,798
You have some nerve calling here.
I haven't heard from you in four months.

222
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,713
You never came to visit me
when I was in that shithole...

223
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,870
...and you didn't return my phone calls.

224
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,758
That's because I didn't want
to see you caged up, baby.

225
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,274
Fuck you.
I don't have anything to say to you.

226
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,716
Honey, I'm sorry. I thought
you might need a little space, that's all.

227
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,313
Well, give me my space now.

228
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,756
I know stuff went bad in the past,
but I'm trying to make you an offer.

229
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,034
What type of offer?

230
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,078
What if I told you
we could split $1 million cash?

231
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,038
-I would tell you to go straight to hell.
-I'm serious. Don't act like that, baby.

232
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,749
We messed up with Lance, but we could
make it with this one, I promise.

233
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,432
What's the scheme this time?

234
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,551
It's such a nice day.
Ming trees across the park.

235
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,474
It's a little early for lunch,
but maybe we can still grab brunch.

236
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,512
Some dim sum, maybe?

237
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,713
The park is a great place to come,
to think and let everything out.

238
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,718
The pressures of your day.

239
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,429
Hey, ladies.

240
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,509
Hey.

241
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,152
I haven't seen you in a couple of days.
You must be slacking off.

242
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,435
-Who was that?
-Nobody. Just some guy.

243
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,396
I jog here most days
and he usually passes me as I go.

244
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,438
-I've been busy lately.
-Yeah.

245
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,638
You know,
that's the most he's ever said to me.

246
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,517
I don't even know his name.

247
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,636
You do have a way about you, Doctor,
to make people be silent.

248
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,273
I miss Lance.

249
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,960
I do. I miss my husband and....

250
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,391
That's why I like this restaurant,
because it reminds me of him.

251
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,278
In what way?

252
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,429
So many ways.

253
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,359
Did you all come here often?

254
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,996
Or was this where you had your first date?

255
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,034
We fucked here.

256
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,350
We made love in this restaurant,
and it was incredible.

257
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,194
You're the first person
I ever shared that with.

258
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,313
That's how Lance was. He was very...

259
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,159
...adventurous and...

260
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,554
...passionate.

261
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,111
He liked walking on the wild side.

262
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,958
He made me do things
I never thought I would do.

263
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,271
Things I never dreamed of doing.

264
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,313
Lance had the goods on me and....

265
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,754
Before him I was so inexperienced.

266
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,433
But he opened me right up.

267
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,951
I remember it so well.

268
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,998
It was close to closing time and our waiter
hadn't come back for a while.

269
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,833
I wanted more rice to go with our food,
so I told Lance.

270
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,109
He started talking. Small talk mostly.

271
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,432
You look dynamite in that gold tonight,
baby. You are glowing.

272
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,236
Thank you.

273
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,231
Then, in the middle of it all, he said:

274
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,389
I want you.

275
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,837
-Lance.
-Now.

276
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,309
Now.

277
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,754
I loved Lance.

278
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,276
And I'd do anything for him.

279
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,068
I was scared and very nervous.

280
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,598
But it turned me on.

281
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,159
Turn around. Who's your daddy?

282
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,678
I remember thinking:

283
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,196
"I can't believe we're doing this. "

284
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,878
But Lance was in control,
and that calmed me right down.

285
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,518
Our waiter was watching us
and I didn't care.

286
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,798
I didn't even care.

287
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,755
So, how was that for opening up, Doctor?

288
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,628
It was fine. Not what I expected...

289
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,149
...but fine.

290
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,954
Victor?

291
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,709
Victor.

292
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,278
Take your clothes off.

293
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,072
No can do. I got to hit the road
early in the morning, baby.

294
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,356
Oh, shit. The whole market
is going to hell, you know.

295
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,713
Baby, can you do this later?

296
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,516
I want to play doctor,
and you need to be a good little patient...

297
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,110
...and take your P.J.s off...

298
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,999
...because I don't want
to sleep like this tonight.

299
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,989
Baby...

300
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,594
...can I take a rain check? Please?

301
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,154
Love you.

302
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,112
I don't care if she sees.

303
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,712
You dreamt about me and Lance,
didn't you, Doctor?

304
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,673
That's ridiculous.

305
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,876
-What would give you that--
-You're lying.

306
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,989
You did.

307
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,795
When I was looking at you
I could see it all over your face.

308
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,271
-Tammy, you are way off base.
-For a shrink, you're very easy to read.

309
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,911
That's one of the things
I really like about you.

310
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,030
This is a complete 180.

311
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,590
First you're silent,
and now you're trying to read me?

312
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,159
I'm a fast learner.

313
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,470
-Okay, let's begin our session.
-Yes, let's.

314
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,869
But you still haven't answered
my question.

315
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Did you dream about me
and Lance last night?

316
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,914
If it makes you happy, no.

317
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,549
Do you like to role-play, Doctor?

318
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,029
You know, act out characters.

319
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,277
Pretend to be other people.

320
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,630
-No.
-You're lying again.

321
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,709
Okay.

322
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,118
Why don't we talk about the night
Mr. Racine was murdered?

323
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,999
Let's not.

324
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,039
-Why not?
-Because I'm not ready.

325
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,789
Oh, Tammy,
you are making such a progression!

326
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,157
You're riding a wave.
You seem so confident.

327
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,639
Now is the perfect time
to revisit this scenario.

328
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,635
You know, I thought
you would understand. I really did.

329
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,753
But I should have known.

330
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,196
No doctor can understand me.
Especially not you.

331
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,559
You're too uptight, Dr. Dubois.

332
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,632
You can't even help yourself.

333
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,158
How in the hell
are you supposed to help me?

334
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,313
Good day, Doctor.

335
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,956
Remember that client I told you about?

336
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,952
Now it's gotten overwhelming.

337
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,797
Like she wants me to go inside myself
to be able to deal with her.

338
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,438
It's like a game with her.

339
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,036
Mia, we can't let our patients
get into our minds.

340
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,635
All we have is our sanity,
and without that we're no good to anyone.

341
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,869
I know.

342
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,359
It just....
It gets a little frustrating sometimes.

343
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,356
It's not like I have any emotional support
at home to help me, either.

344
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,992
It seems nothing has changed with Victor.

345
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,432
It's gotten even worse.

346
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,356
He is such a bad actor. He doesn't
even pretend to love me anymore.

347
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,508
He's always out of town, so he says.

348
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,592
Always on business or whatever.

349
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,875
He's probably got
another woman somewhere.

350
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,269
I don't know.

351
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,070
I'm just tired and I'm lonely.

352
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,560
This is crazy!
I'm supposed to be the professional...

353
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,949
...analysing the minds of others.
Here I am.

354
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,713
I can't figure out the intentions
of my own husband.

355
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,109
That's the downside of our business.

356
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,715
It's always easier helping other people.

357
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,992
I may be a loser at my marriage...

358
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,675
...but I'm damn sure
I'm not going to be a loser at work.

359
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,675
It's one thing I still have control over.

360
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,312
Tammy, I want to help.

361
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,114
I want to understand.

362
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,517
If you really want to know who I am...

363
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,396
...then you have to go where I've been.

364
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,878
Well, I'm ready.

365
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,108
Depending on...

366
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,717
...where it is
and what you are talking about.

367
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,870
You can't rationalise it, Doctor.

368
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,628
You can't dissect it. Not this.

369
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,348
You just got to sit back and enjoy the ride.

370
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,112
Tammy, I admit it does sound intriguing,
but I don't know.

371
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,229
And that's why
you have to see for yourself.

372
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,589
But once you're inside Pandora's Box...

373
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,399
...you never know who you might see.

374
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,473
Tell me more, Tammy.

375
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,111
Here are the rules to Pandora's Box:

376
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,073
There are no rules.
Any and everything goes.

377
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,592
And what happens there, stays there.

378
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,151
And once Lance took me there,
I did things and became involved...

379
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,196
...with someone that changed my life.

380
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,590
Forever.

381
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,155
Tammy, I agreed to help you, but...

382
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,109
...I don't know.

383
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,636
I mean, do we really do stuff like that?

384
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,233
Doctor, loosen up. You'll be fine.

385
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,589
Yeah?

386
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,919
Where's this place located?

387
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,196
"Here is a list of things you need to do.

388
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,475
"I'll see you on the weekend. Love, Victor.

389
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,551
"Post office. Cleaners." What?

390
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,112
-Hello?
-Babe?

391
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,471
Hey, honey, how are you?

392
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,149
Okay.

393
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,278
I thought you were going
to be home this evening.

394
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,037
Yeah...

395
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,911
...I thought I would be, too.

396
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,679
Things got a little...

397
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,919
...hectic for me, you know?

398
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,757
So when will you be back in town?

399
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,789
Is everything okay?

400
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,115
Yeah, hold on one second.

401
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,273
Shut the fuck up.

402
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,717
Listen, can I call you back later?

403
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,188
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

404
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,555
Yeah.

405
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,592
Okay, because I got to go. 'Bye.

406
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,877
Why did you do that
when you knew I was on the phone?

407
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,278
Loosen up. You know you like it.

408
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,879
And I know you want it.

409
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,751
Yeah, but you knew that was Mia.

410
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,116
And? No one is begging you to be here.

411
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,158
You sent for me, remember?

412
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,114
Hello.

413
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,239
You've been approved.
So it's on tonight if you want it. You're in.

414
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,995
-Tonight?
-Yes.

415
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,439
Fuck it. I'm in.
Just tell me what I have to do.

416
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,195
There is one rule to Pandora's Box.
The rite of passage.

417
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,153
The first time you go,
you have to go alone.

418
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,277
-You mean you're not going to be there?
-I won't.

419
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,313
-May we help you?
-Yeah, I'm looking for paradise.

420
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,156
-Where do you seek it?
-From within these walls.

421
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,991
-How do you get there?
-By opening the box.

422
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,158
Do you want this to happen?

423
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,955
Yes.

424
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,673
You choose. Your pleasure.

425
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,912
-What the hell is this?
-The price of admission. Your choice.

426
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,159
-Please.
-I choose this one.

427
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,993
What the hell.... You only live once, right?

428
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,753
Bottoms up.

429
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,713
That's something.

430
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,759
Enjoy yourself.

431
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,233
What can I do for you?

432
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,589
Do you know how to make
a decent Manhattan?

433
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,115
I sure do.

434
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,589
Say, where can I leave my jacket?

435
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,348
You can rely on me.
I'll take care of it for you.

436
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,550
You have a good evening.

437
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,796
Thank you. You, too.

438
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,830
-You scared me.
-Did l?

439
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,755
Yes.

440
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,593
-What are you doing here?
-I was about to ask you the same question.

441
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,916
-Doesn't look like your type of party.
-It's a long story.

442
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,633
So, you like what you saw?

443
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,710
In there. Did you like what you saw?

444
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,077
-It's different.
-It's different.

445
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,358
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

446
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,793
Take off your clothes.

447
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,519
Excuse me?

448
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,593
I said take them off.

449
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,598
And what if I don't want to?

450
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,789
But you do want to.

451
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,271
-You're serious.
-Of course I am.

452
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,318
-What are you doing?
-Exactly what you want me to do.

453
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,435
Stop.

454
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,149
Why?

455
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,679
I don't even know you.

456
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,471
You know what?
You ask too many questions.

457
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,353
Can I at least know your name first?

458
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,073
Why is the thought of names so important?

459
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,679
Doesn't the concept of mystery
just thrill you more?

460
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,309
Hampton.

461
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,554
And you are?

462
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,509
Mia...

463
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,874
...do you trust me?

464
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,991
I don't even know you.

465
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,993
That doesn't matter.

466
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,239
Do you trust me?

467
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,989
Yes.

468
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,949
Good.

469
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,869
Because I make the rules tonight.

470
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,914
Sometimes I take journeys, Doctor.

471
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,436
I feel these urges.

472
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,839
It's like I'm in another place in time.

473
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,550
My old girlfriend goes there, too.

474
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,114
She likes it.

475
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,679
She likes me.

476
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,594
It's like wonderland, this place.

477
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,909
Better.

478
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,479
Are you listening to me?

479
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,915
-Yes, I am.
-Yeah, right.

480
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,629
Go on.

481
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,352
It's okay. I'm listening.

482
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,198
You know we're going to have
to stop meeting like this, right?

483
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,480
If you're not too busy,
I'd like to see you again.

484
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,592
Is that another one of your jokes?

485
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,274
-No. I'm totally serious.
-And I'm very married.

486
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,158
-Are you very happy, though?
-That's none of your business.

487
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,993
If you want to be happy,
maybe I can make it my business.

488
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,477
You're a very pretty lady
and I think you're worth the fight.

489
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,790
Flattery will get you nowhere, sir. I am--

490
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,156
Immune?
Is that what you were going to say?

491
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,752
Very cute. I bet you've got
this whole thing planned.

492
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,799
No, baby. I never plan. I improvise.

493
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,078
And spontaneity keeps you young,
makes life exciting.

494
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,560
-That's what they say.
-That's what I say.

495
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,750
Here we are,
a boy and a girl in a library getting cosy?

496
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,038
I'm feeling like I'm in grade school again.
I think I got--

497
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,516
-Like that?
-You hear that?

498
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,751
-What? What?
-School bell. Time for class.

499
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,196
Oh, well. Then I'll see you at recess.

500
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,629
-We'll give her five minutes.
-All right.

501
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,314
-Good afternoon.
-Hey, what's up, Doc?

502
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,795
Fellows?

503
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,478
So, we hear
you're counselling Tammy Racine.

504
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,639
Yes, I am.

505
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,989
-So?
-So what?

506
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,511
I told you guys before,
I cannot break confidentiality.

507
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,709
I took an oath.

508
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,800
You guys know about that, right? See you.

509
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,593
I told you.

510
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,158
Oh, these are beautiful.

511
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,110
Somebody's been reading my stuff.

512
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,828
"Meet me in the master bath
at the Box tonight."

513
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,909
You are taking an awful lot for granted.

514
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,835
Well, you're here, aren't you?

515
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,871
How did you know where I worked?

516
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,954
You seemed like the reading type,
so I asked the librarian where you worked.

517
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,278
Resourcefulness, I like that.

518
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,311
Looks expensive.

519
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,434
Get in.

520
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,629
Get in.

521
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,637
Can I get a "hello" or something first?

522
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,513
-Did you like the flowers?
-Sure. They were beautiful.

523
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,709
Right.

524
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,749
Wait.

525
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,039
Do it slow.
You've got all the time in the world.

526
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,437
I'm not going anywhere.

527
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,629
I may be.

528
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,319
I don't think so.

529
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,595
I want to watch while you do this.

530
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,554
Turn around.

531
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,229
Stop.

532
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,790
-I don't even--
-Don't even talk.

533
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,752
-Tonight I don't want you to do anything.
-Why?

534
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,755
-Because I'm going to do you.
-What are you going to do to me?

535
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,473
Serve you.

536
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,719
Love you and taste you. Come here.

537
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,517
Put your head back. Open your mouth.
Don't close it.

538
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,270
Sorry, my man,
I didn't know this room was occupied.

539
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,868
No problem, man.
Close the door behind you.

540
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,394
You mind if we party with you?
Forget ménage á trois...

541
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,836
...this could be a one, two, three, four,
quintuplet-trois. What's up?

542
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,592
No, I play on my field tonight.

543
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,557
All right, game player.

544
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,750
You probably pissed in the water anyway.

545
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,871
Come here. Lay next to me.

546
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,876
I like it here with you.

547
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,558
This is so weird.

548
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,397
This place is crazy. It's so wrong.

549
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,400
But as wrong as it is, I don't want to leave.

550
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,914
This is the first time in a long time
I feel so free.

551
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,713
You just be.

552
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,793
I think it doesn't matter what you look like,
you do, or how much money you make.

553
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,478
Exactly.

554
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,318
It's like living in the moment
for the first time in my life.

555
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,279
And everyday rules just don't apply.

556
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,516
Now you know why I like it here.

557
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,558
I don't like to follow the rules too much.

558
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,913
This is bad for me. I can feel it.

559
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,315
What?

560
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,515
I admit...

561
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,629
...I want it.

562
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,672
You don't even want to know
about my husband?

563
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,238
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't care less about him.

564
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,593
But if you want to include me
in that part of your life, then fine.

565
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,956
Tell you the truth...

566
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,311
...I only want to hear about you.

567
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,274
Is that right?

568
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,509
That's right.

569
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,635
You got me here.

570
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,193
I'm all ears.

571
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,037
-So, where the hell have you been?
-What are you doing in here?

572
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,874
No, I think you need
to answer me first, Doctor...

573
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,349
...considering you missed our appointment.

574
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,949
Yeah.

575
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,518
And why haven't you called me
since you went to the club?

576
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,915
Okay, I tried to call you.

577
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,719
I thought you said you wanted to help me.

578
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,357
"l want to understand you, Tammy.
Open up, Tammy."

579
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,199
But you don't even care enough
to keep our appointment?

580
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,600
You have me sitting in here
waiting on you?

581
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,798
I'm sorry about the appointment.
There's nothing I can do about that now.

582
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,514
No, there's nothing you can do.

583
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,197
What kind of friend are you?

584
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,153
Tammy, I am your doctor.
I can't cross that line.

585
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,508
It's too late.

586
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,793
You crossed the line
when you accepted the invitation.

587
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,429
Listen...

588
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,958
...I've been having some pretty
bad dreams about the night...

589
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,077
...that my husband was murdered.

590
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,792
Sit down, Tammy.

591
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,718
Go ahead, sit down.

592
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,631
Would you like to talk about it?

593
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,073
I don't know.

594
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,910
Have you ever done something
that you regret?

595
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,075
Sure.

596
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,675
Yeah?

597
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,349
Me, too.

598
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,594
Is there anything specific
you'd like to discuss?

599
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,830
The killer mentioned Pandora's Box.

600
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,433
And I think that it's someone
that we got mixed up with at the club.

601
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,431
Why did you send me there?

602
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,758
I needed you to share this experience
to help me move past this.

603
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,029
Hello?

604
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,949
Hello?

605
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,189
Who is this?

606
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,838
Can I ask you a question?

607
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,589
What?

608
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,997
Actually I have two questions.

609
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,828
First is, how was your day?

610
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,350
I'm feeling better.

611
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,236
But it's been bumpy thus far.

612
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,714
Hopefully things will get better for you.

613
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,071
And what's the second question?

614
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,636
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

615
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,710
Go on. Forward.

616
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,318
-I'm going to look.
-No, you ain't.

617
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,312
You ain't going to look.
You'd better not look.

618
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,913
-You're almost there.
-Almost?

619
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,433
-Almost there.
-I'm gonna look.

620
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,318
No, don't you look. And stop.

621
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,428
Surprise.

622
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,798
-All this for me?
-Who else would it be for?

623
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,318
Dinner is served.

624
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,433
Once again, you've got me speechless.

625
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,195
Madame?

626
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,195
-Thank you, sir.
-Very welcome.

627
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,474
They're watching us.

628
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,517
They're probably getting ready to leave
their boring jobs...

629
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,794
...going home to their average lives.

630
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,799
I bet you...

631
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,914
...that right now, they wish
they could be sitting where you are.

632
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,869
-ls that so?
-Yeah, I'm sure it is.

633
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,314
Wait.

634
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,759
What you got in mind?

635
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,719
If they want to be where I am so much...

636
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,912
...Iet's give them something
to be real jealous about.

637
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,759
All right.

638
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,231
Donna, I need to speak with you.

639
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,158
Listen, I'm having a moment,
and I need your advice.

640
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,790
Is that patient getting to you?
Mia, look, I told you, you can't--

641
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,909
It's not that.

642
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,351
Donna, don't judge me.

643
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,033
I met a man.

644
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,838
This is so obscene,
I can't believe I'm going to share this.

645
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,918
You're not trying to tell me
what I think you are.

646
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,353
Because the Mia I know was mad as hell
because her husband was cheating on her.

647
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,669
Fuck Victor.

648
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,512
This man has me completely open.

649
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,789
He's mysterious and adventurous.

650
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,072
Donna, he listens.

651
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,879
And the sex?

652
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,311
It's spectacular.
It's the only way to describe it.

653
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,271
-Where did you meet him?
-You don't want to know.

654
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,476
Let's just say it was someplace I had...

655
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,392
...no business being.

656
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,354
Well, I'm no fan of Victor's,
but what about your marriage?

657
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,678
It seems like you're getting pretty
caught up with this guy.

658
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,273
I can handle myself.

659
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,398
Besides,
men have been doing this for years.

660
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,589
It's not like Victor loves me
anymore, anyway.

661
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,191
Let's just be careful.

662
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,315
Because once you open Pandora's box,
you could have hell to pay.

663
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,551
What did you just say?

664
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,990
I got your invite. Here I am.

665
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,991
So, what's on the main menu tonight?

666
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,512
A night of romance.

667
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,149
Victor....

668
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,879
Yeah. Who did you expect?

669
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,195
You.

670
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,478
You just surprised me, that's all.

671
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,589
Drink up.

672
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,876
What's gotten into you lately?

673
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,234
I was getting ready to ask you
the same thing.

674
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,158
I've been thinking.

675
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:29,398
I've been so busy working
to make a better lifestyle for us...

676
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,313
...that I forgot to help make us better.

677
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,193
So, I apologise.

678
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,475
You're awfully reserved today, Doctor.

679
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:00,036
I'm finishing up your evaluation.
Our sessions are done.

680
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,035
Really?

681
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,236
There's something on your mind.

682
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,911
-You care to share?
-No.

683
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,359
Come on, Doctor...

684
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,791
...tell me what's on your mind.

685
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,035
You want to talk to me about it.
I can feel it.

686
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,589
-Do you want to know what I'm thinking?
-Yes.

687
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,239
Do you really?

688
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,513
Can you handle helping anybody
besides yourself?

689
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,439
Are you ready to listen?

690
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,353
Because most people are not.
Talk, talk, but nobody wants to...

691
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,359
...reciprocate.

692
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,159
Nobody wants to receive.

693
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,399
So if you're ready to listen, fine.
But if you're not...

694
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,399
...then I'd rather not share
my personal life with you.

695
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,669
No.

696
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,274
Bravo, Doctor.

697
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,879
That was good.

698
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,112
You're ready for the big time.

699
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,429
Tammy...

700
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,075
...I'm going through a lot right now.

701
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,636
And maybe you were right.
We have crossed that line.

702
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,954
So you should find somebody else
to help you.

703
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,310
No, I won't.

704
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,155
Now I need you to talk to me.

705
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,150
You want me to apologise?
Okay, I'm sorry.

706
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,749
But I need to hear
what you have to say. Please.

707
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,751
I'm caught in the middle of something.

708
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,708
And I can't choose.

709
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,917
You know real women choose
their own destiny.

710
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,555
We have the right to decide what we want.

711
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,794
Even if it's the choice between two people?

712
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,795
Can you love two people the same way
with the same amount of passion?

713
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,109
I don't know.

714
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,309
Can you?

715
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,353
What are you talking about?

716
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,433
You know...

717
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,958
...you want to save me...

718
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,913
...don't you, Doctor?

719
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,839
You want to cure me.

720
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,159
I tell you what:

721
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,228
Save yourself first.

722
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,399
Be true to yourself.

723
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,319
And at that very moment...

724
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,479
...you will have saved me.

725
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,032
Baby, this food is absolutely delicious.
How's your meal?

726
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,236
-It's great.
-Yeah? Good.

727
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,718
Is that.... No, it couldn't be.

728
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,355
I think it is, that guy over there....
Thank you very much.

729
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,158
I went to college with him years ago.
I think that's...

730
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,353
...Hampton Hines!

731
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,158
Well, well, well.

732
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,873
Shall we toast?

733
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,116
What to?

734
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,992
How about to once-in-a-lifetime meetings?

735
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,509
Hear, hear.

736
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,508
Cheers.

737
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,909
Hamp, your last season was incredible.

738
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,354
Thank you.

739
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,677
As a matter of fact, Mia and l
still go to the homecoming games.

740
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,633
That's good.

741
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,196
Because the school sure needs the support.

742
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,838
So, what is it that you do?

743
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,350
My wife is a psychologist.

744
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,439
-She studies behaviourism.
-lnteresting.

745
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,869
Yeah, very.

746
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,149
My job is more simple:

747
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,838
I work for an agricultural firm.
We buy and sell land, among other things.

748
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,470
You two seem like quite the power couple.

749
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,753
Yes, we are.

750
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,796
-Hines, party of three?
-There's my party.

751
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,712
Listen, Victor, and I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

752
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,155
-Mia.
-Mia, that's right.

753
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,273
-It's been great hanging with you guys.
-You, too.

754
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,433
-I'll be in touch.
-That's cool.

755
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,832
Maybe I'll see you guys
at one of the local games.

756
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,509
Definitely.

757
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,153
Bring your wife.
I have a feeling she'd like it.

758
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,595
No, Mia hates sports.

759
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,069
All right, now.

760
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,796
-You all have a good time.
-You take care.

761
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,033
Wasn't that wild?

762
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,474
Definitely.

763
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,319
Hampton Hines.

764
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,751
Victor, excuse me.
I need to go to the restroom.

765
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,197
What you in here getting wet for?

766
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,834
That's my job.

767
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,759
I didn't know you and Victor
knew each other from school.

768
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,798
Small world, ain't it? Come here.

769
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,948
Hampton, please,
my husband is in the restaurant.

770
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,192
This is crazy. Hampton, don't!

771
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,676
Don't. Hampton, don't.

772
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,191
Hampton, don't.

773
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,315
-Here you go, my man.
-Thank you, sir.

774
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,396
You know, I almost started to send
that waiter in there after you.

775
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,154
I'm fine. Woman stuff.

776
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,429
Yeah, right.

777
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,713
So did you enjoy dinner?

778
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,916
Yes, I did.

779
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,759
I'm sorry.

780
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,113
I'm not in the mood.

781
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,316
So what, you just...

782
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,551
...going to go to sleep, like that?

783
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,074
Good night, Victor.

784
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,870
-Are you crazy?
-For you.

785
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,353
What is it?

786
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,349
Hampton.

787
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,839
Right on time.

788
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,549
Whatever happens tonight is between...

789
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,469
...me...

790
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,639
...and you...

791
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,908
...and you.

792
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,549
Mia?

793
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,549
You okay, baby?

794
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,548
I can't sleep.

795
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,914
Come here, honey.

796
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,950
Hey, Hamp. How's it going?

797
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,478
It's moving. So what's good here?

798
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,317
Lots of people say the chicken pita.

799
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,637
I'll take one of them.

800
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,435
-Yo, Marco, one more chicken pita, please.
-All right.

801
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,997
I should have something for you this week.

802
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,991
Yeah? Good.

803
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,108
Because the sooner you bring me
what I need...

804
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,630
...the sooner we can get
this whole thing over with.

805
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,957
You never told me
why you don't just stay married to her.

806
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,714
I mean, you'll get paid either way, right?

807
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,077
Stay with her for what?

808
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,549
I put in more than enough time
in that marriage.

809
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,557
I deserve what's coming to me.

810
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,599
Why don't you worry about you.
Just hold up your end of the deal.

811
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,635
Hey, don't worry about me.
I have everything under control.

812
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,312
You make sure things work out in the end.
I don't want another Tammy/e fuck-up.

813
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,477
That stupid bitch?

814
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,797
How could you not be listed
on the insurance policy is beyond me.

815
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,797
That's why I'm not fucking with her
until this is all over with.

816
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,914
Bitch had me almost risk going to prison.

817
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:25,153
I'll be damned if I do any more time,
goddamned if I pay her incompetent ass.

818
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,709
Hey, Hamp...

819
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,672
...handle it. Don't screw this up, man.

820
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,276
Remember: $1.5 million.

821
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,069
Come in.

822
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,952
I'm about to go to lunch. You hungry?

823
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,553
Not really.

824
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,357
What's the matter, partner?

825
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,711
You look like one of my patients.

826
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,439
Is it that obvious?

827
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,594
Yeah. I think you need a vacation.
Somewhere tropical.

828
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,349
It's Victor.

829
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,349
-What has he done this time?
-Nothing.

830
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,679
He's been nothing but Mr. Wonderful.

831
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,159
It's been a long time.

832
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,351
Isn't that what you always wanted?

833
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,553
Sure, but I haven't gotten affection
from him in years and...

834
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,872
...all of a sudden he's the ideal husband.

835
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,311
Victor is a very smart man.

836
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,837
He's not too smooth or exciting,
but he is smart.

837
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,713
He knows you're about to get
all that money next month.

838
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,112
And he wants to get his piece, girl.
I can't say that I blame him.

839
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,429
Thanks.

840
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,398
I mean, people marry for money
all the time.

841
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,155
Now you said yourself
that he didn't love you.

842
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,232
But you're the perfect catch.

843
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,959
So it's all about money?

844
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,073
But Victor is going to play nice
because it's not like he can divorce you.

845
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,197
If he does, your prenuptial
stops him from getting anything.

846
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,191
So don't worry about it.

847
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,119
That's not entirely true.

848
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,749
What?

849
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,110
-Hey, love.
-Hey, baby.

850
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,997
Thank you for meeting me.

851
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,998
No problem.

852
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,720
So what's up?

853
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,919
When we first met,
you asked did I trust you, remember?

854
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,229
Yeah.

855
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,076
I'd like to know the same thing.

856
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,273
Do you trust me?

857
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,999
Of course I do.

858
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,310
No, do you really trust me?

859
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,638
Yes, Mia. I do.

860
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,269
Good.

861
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,349
I was raised in a wealthy family.

862
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,679
My father made most of his fortune
in the construction business.

863
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,950
When he died, he set the company up
so it'd keep running the way he wanted.

864
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,199
There was also a trust set up in my name
that gives me access to money...

865
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,669
...and stocks on my 35th birthday.

866
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,949
Okay.

867
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,036
So I will be 35 next month,
and I'll be worth $20 million.

868
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,676
-$20 million?
-Yes.

869
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,950
Hampton, my marriage is going nowhere...

870
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,516
...and my father set this up this way
to try and protect me.

871
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,914
That's neither here nor there.

872
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,600
Wait a minute.
You must have a prenuptial, right?

873
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,795
I do.

874
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,117
But if Victor can prove infidelity
on my part...

875
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,672
...then he's entitled to $10 million
of my father's money.

876
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,431
-$10 million? You've got to be kidding me.
-No. Unfortunately, I'm not.

877
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,710
I can't allow this man to divorce me
and steal...

878
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,349
...half of what my father gave his life to.

879
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,311
Hampton, I don't know what to do.

880
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,671
-I can't believe this is happening to me.
-Why don't you just leave?

881
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,912
I mean, you're smart, beautiful.
You can have any man you want.

882
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,677
I was blinded by love. I wanted it to work.

883
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,954
So what makes you think
he's going to divorce you?

884
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,079
Call it women's intuition.
I've just got this feeling.

885
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,793
You know, I almost feel like paying him,
but just not...

886
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,871
-...$10 million.
-What if he couldn't divorce you...

887
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,477
...or do a thing to you?

888
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,078
What do you mean?

889
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:03,310
What if I can make sure
that he never bothered you again?

890
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,916
How could you make sure?

891
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,635
Hurt him?

892
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,915
Kill him?

893
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,748
-Hampton, that's murder!
-He'd never bother you again.

894
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,515
Why would you do something like that?

895
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,109
-To protect what's mine.
-I'm yours?

896
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,750
-Don't you want to be with me?
-Sure, but....

897
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,553
But what?

898
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,878
It just seems so final.

899
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,237
Sometimes, true freedom
can only come with bloodshed.

900
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,909
History has proven that
time and time again.

901
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,069
Right.

902
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,229
If you want to take your destiny into
your own hands for once, and be free...

903
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,670
...then take my hand right now.

904
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,474
If not, just walk away.

905
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,594
But know that you will never be rid of this.

906
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,633
It's up to you.

907
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,713
Problem solved.

908
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,070
Come on. Yeah, who is it?

909
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,714
It's Hamp.

910
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,233
Come on in.

911
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,194
I see you spared no expense on this place.

912
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,792
Yeah, well, I had to pick a spot
that Mia would never come to.

913
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,070
So, I see you got the game on.

914
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,148
Philly's up by ten.

915
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,358
They'll probably take
the whole thing this year.

916
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,552
I thought you was a Bulls fan.

917
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,830
I was when they had Jordan.

918
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,511
I like the Sixers now.

919
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,190
If you were a true fan,
it wouldn't matter if Jordan played or not.

920
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,670
All right, Hamp, so what's up?
Got the tape?

921
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,359
Yeah, I got the tape.

922
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,118
Well, where is it, my brother?

923
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,151
Come on, don't keep me in suspense.

924
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,590
So, what happens now?

925
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,114
Once I make sure
I have you two on tape fucking...

926
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,231
...it will prove her infidelity.

927
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,390
Then I will file for divorce.
It's very, very simple.

928
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,955
So, you just been pretending
so you could show the court...

929
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,116
...that you tried to save the relationship?

930
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,750
Right. Makes me look even more noble...

931
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,593
...if they see she had an affair with you
all the time...

932
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,157
...I was trying to salvage our love.

933
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,955
Oh, yeah.

934
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,035
You know...

935
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,195
...you look like you're really into it.

936
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,593
Look at you. Making faces and everything.

937
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,518
It was business.

938
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,193
I had to make it look real,
you know what I mean?

939
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,709
Damn.

940
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,311
Now, that's good.

941
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,234
Oh, yeah.

942
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,916
How'd it feel to watch me do your wife?

943
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,478
It felt like I was a rich man.

944
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,353
Well, how rich?

945
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,273
When do I get my cut?

946
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,830
Hamp, like I told you, I get $3 million.

947
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,789
You get half of that for helping me
pull this off.

948
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,475
You get paid when I do.

949
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,877
This thing might be tied up in court
for six months to a year.

950
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,799
But for now, baby, we are in the clear.

951
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,516
All right, but you can never be
too cautious these days.

952
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,313
Especially when it comes to money.

953
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,398
Hamp, how long have I known you, man?

954
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,114
Fucking years.

955
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,111
Have I ever let you down?

956
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,479
Other than the bank heist you called
foolproof, that got me locked up?

957
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,517
You know what?
That shit wasn't my fault.

958
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,591
Why are you dragging that up?

959
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,798
I had that whole thing set.
It was you, man. You screwed that up.

960
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,758
So don't stand here
and try to blame me for that.

961
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,390
When you try to take a nigger
out of the 'hood, they end up ungrateful.

962
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,835
Hampton, shut up and stop your bitching--

963
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,719
Damn, man.

964
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,034
Sounds like
you're having trouble breathing.

965
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,436
What the fuck are you doing, Hamp?

966
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,832
Hey, you know...

967
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,830
...I'm tired of taking your shit.

968
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,712
Got my own plan.

969
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,715
I don't have to listen to your shit no more.

970
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,474
Fuck you!

971
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,838
No, brother, I'm going to fuck your wife.

972
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,119
Dr. Dubois?

973
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,190
Yes, Catherine.

974
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,555
The police are here to see you.

975
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,031
She'll be right with you.

976
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,273
What's up, guys? What can I do for you?

977
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,594
I don't have any leads with Tammy Racine,
so don't even ask.

978
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,868
Mia, we have some bad news,
maybe you'd better sit down.

979
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,311
Blue called us for 911.
A hotel on Fourth Street.

980
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,756
We got there,
and in a room on the first floor...

981
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,199
...we found Victor...

982
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,070
...with two gunshot wounds.

983
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,348
He was dead when we got there, Mia.

984
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,273
We'll need signatures here and here,
and three copies here.

985
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,479
I know it feels like you're signing a lot,
but you'll be wealthy when this is done.

986
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,590
This actually is your copy.

987
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,031
And there we go.

988
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,958
I believe that will do it.

989
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,074
You are now officially $20 million richer.

990
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,678
Thank you guys for your help.

991
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,832
I know some great financial planners
who can help you invest.

992
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,834
I know a lot about stocks,
and I have other things to take care of.

993
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,388
But if I'm interested, I will let you know.

994
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,949
Okay.

995
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,149
Mia.

996
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,598
I want to let you know how sorry
we are to hear about your husband.

997
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,069
Your dad was a great man
and business leader and humanitarian.

998
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,350
And I was glad to know him.

999
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,389
I'm sorry you lost two people
that you loved.

1000
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:08,071
But hopefully this funds allocation
will give you some measure of comfort.

1001
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,759
I appreciate that.
Can you excuse me for a moment?

1002
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:12,869
Of course.

1003
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,958
-Hello.
-Hey, baby.

1004
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,312
Hey, you. How are you?

1005
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,836
I've been laying low, you know.
How have you been?

1006
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,910
Trying to hold it together.
It's only been a week since the funeral.

1007
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,958
Right. When am I going to see you again?

1008
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,391
-How's lunch sound?
-That sounds great.

1009
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,875
-Let's say about 1:30.
-Oh, not good.

1010
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,198
Can we make it a late lunch,
say, 3:00, 3:30? Does that work for you?

1011
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,192
Sure, baby. That's fine.

1012
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,388
Well, I'll see you.

1013
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,909
-I'll see you then.
-All right.

1014
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,430
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

1015
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,514
New boyfriend?

1016
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,154
Oh, no.

1017
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,189
That's one of my girlfriends.

1018
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,191
She'll do anything to cheer me up.

1019
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,038
Atlanta has fairly sunny skies,
a high of 75--

1020
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,069
Hello?

1021
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,269
Mia?

1022
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,275
Hey.

1023
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,909
Where are you?

1024
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,237
I'm at home. Where did you think I was?

1025
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,155
You were supposed to meet me
here at 3:00, right?

1026
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,597
I'm sorry. I got caught up at work.
Let me call you right back.

1027
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,072
Then I'll be there.
Stay right there, all right?

1028
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,989
Hello?

1029
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,031
What the fuck kind of bull--

1030
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,634
Oh, shit.

1031
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,359
She set me up.

1032
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,519
Remember, he's armed and dangerous.

1033
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,950
Use extreme caution.

1034
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,837
Hampton Hines. Open up. Police.

1035
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,957
Mr. Hines, I'm only going to ask you
one more time, sir.

1036
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,069
No answer.

1037
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,111
He's one down below you.

1038
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,915
Lieutenant! Here's the weapon.

1039
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,916
Just where she said it was going to be.

1040
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,514
We got him.

1041
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,673
You want to save me?

1042
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,552
Save yourself first.

1043
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,592
Be true to yourself.

1044
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,036
And at that very moment...

1045
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,076
...you will have saved me.

1046
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,599
You want to save me?

1047
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,795
Prove it.

1048
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,916
I have all the proof you need.

1049
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,477
If you can make it worth my while.

1050
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,193
Like $1 million. Cash.

1051
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:44,832
You're trying to tell me that Victor
and Hampton are setting me up...

1052
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:51,508
...so that Victor can divorce me
and take half of my father's money?

1053
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,308
Exactly.

1054
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,793
And you know this because....

1055
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,236
I'm the link between you and Hampton.

1056
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:08,516
After I fell for Hampton,
it was his idea to kill my husband.

1057
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,748
And I know where he hid the weapon.

1058
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,554
And does Hampton know you know this?

1059
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,316
Of course not. He thinks I'm stupid.

1060
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,031
I'm scared.

1061
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,117
He's dangerous.
I know he killed my husband.

1062
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,028
Okay. Just slow down.

1063
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,872
How can you be sure?
And then when did this affair start?

1064
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,913
I know he killed Victor in a jealous rage.

1065
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,790
He killed Tammy Racine's husband, Lance.

1066
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,717
He told me where the knife is.

1067
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,556
I feel so stupid.

1068
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,470
Try and relax, everything will be okay.

1069
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,954
We got our man
in both the Racine and Dubois cases.

1070
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,355
-We're going to need some backup.
-Let's go.

1071
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,319
Is this what you wanted?

1072
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,594
-Yes, thank you.
-You're welcome.

1073
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,638
Donna was right.
This is exactly the vacation I needed.

1074
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,950
And I'm glad you invited me, girl.

1075
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,276
I could get used to this.

1076
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,276
