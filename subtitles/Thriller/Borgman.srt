1
00:00:55,291 --> 00:01:03,333
And they descended upon the earth
to strengthen their ranks

2
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,166
Ludwig...

3
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,083
Jesus man, what's up?
- Why don't you answer the phone?

4
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,208
Asleep, wasn't I?
- We've been grassed on. Get moving.

5
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,416
Is it urgent?
- Yes, make sure I can ring you.

6
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,583
Hey, Camiel. Everything OK?
- No.

7
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,916
Why don't you pick up the phone?

8
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,458
Get away from here. Soon as you can.

9
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,041
Good afternoon, madam.

10
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,458
And?

11
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,458
I wonder if I could have a bath here.
I'm a bit dirty.

12
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,291
Good afternoon.

13
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,875
You're Mr van Schendel?
- Yes?

14
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,416
Could I perhaps just take a bath here?

15
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,166
Beg pardon?
- A shower would do.

16
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,625
Don't think so.
- You'd be doing me a great favour.

17
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,000
You see, I haven't been able to wash
for ages.

18
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,541
That may well be, but you can't.

19
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,875
Wait a minute.

20
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,375
You're turning it into a problem.

21
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,666
I'm just a traveller who needs a wash.

22
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,916
I don't know you
and I don't let strangers in.

23
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,333
I'm Anton Breskens.

24
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,625
Born in Flanders to Dutch parents.

25
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,500
Doesn't sound at all good. Goodbye.

26
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,916
I know your wife.

27
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,666
You know my wife?

28
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,625
Why are you here, you runt?
- Take it easy.

29
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm not making any claims.
I can't help knowing your wife.

30
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,791
Who is it?

31
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,250
Do you know this man?
- No.

32
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,875
Anton?
- Breskens.

33
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,833
Doesn't ring a bell.

34
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,458
I don't know him.

35
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,250
Come on, Maria. The hospital.
Remember? You were my nurse.

36
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,125
I'm not a nurse and I'm not called Maria.
- You were then.

37
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,416
Admit it, Maria.
- My wife's name is Marina.

38
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,875
Marina, Maria... What's the difference?

39
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,833
She doesn't know you.
You hear me? Off with you!

40
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,958
Marina, you nursed me for three months.

41
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,000
You read to me at night.
Sometimes you came and lay down with me.

42
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,833
Am I in for it
because I knew your wife?

43
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,625
If you don't get out of here
I'll bash your face in.

44
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,416
Marina, does he have to be so aggressive?

45
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,458
Don't, Richard.

46
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,166
Bugger off.

47
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,666
Bastard.

48
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,083
Richard...

49
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,500
Richard!

50
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,416
Who is that bastard?

51
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,375
Are you hiding things from me?
Did you used to be a nurse?

52
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,166
Of course not.
- Who is he? Do you know him?

53
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,041
What do you think?
- Don't wind me up. Do you know him or not?

54
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,250
No, I don't know him.

55
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,958
We promised each other something once.

56
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,125
Yes, to be honest.
I am. I don't know him.

57
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,166
Listen Richard, you laid into a man.
He needs care.

58
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,500
The ship moved away from the quay.

59
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:30,083
The children waved to their father
who stood on the poop deck.

60
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,041
He waved back with a small handkerchief.

61
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,958
The ship passed the pier
and sailed out to sea.

62
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,000
Their father grew smaller and smaller, but
he kept waving. And so did they, of course.

63
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,333
Until they couldn't see each other
any longer.

64
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,458
And now to bed.

65
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,291
Darling...

66
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,166
My little flower...

67
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,625
My king...

68
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,041
Sleep tight.

69
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,625
Stornebrink rang.
There's going to be chaos.

70
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,916
I've got to go there.
- OK.

71
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,625
I'm here.

72
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,291
Shoes off.

73
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,125
Walk quietly.

74
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,333
Can I trust you?

75
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,041
Sleep well.

76
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:57,833
Yes?

77
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,041
Flu?

78
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,541
Darling...

79
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,333
Are you a tiny bit ill?
- We'll be late.

80
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,375
Mum, we're off.
- Bye.

81
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,041
I saw a magician.

82
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,458
She's delirious.

83
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,250
She's not running a temperature.

84
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,708
Any chance of breakfast together?

85
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,625
I would appreciate it if you left.

86
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,750
I can give you a lift.

87
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,083
Drop you somewhere?

88
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,708
I have to go?
- Please.

89
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,333
Some soup, one night's sleep,
and the damage is bought off?

90
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,041
It hurts everywhere.

91
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,083
That's terrible.
My husband misbehaved. I'm sorry.

92
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,333
Is that all a nurse can say: I'm sorry?

93
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:12,125
What use is sympathy to me?
I need nursing. Nurse me.

94
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,583
What about breakfast?
- I'm not a nurse. Never have been.

95
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,666
I can take you to a private clinic.

96
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,375
At my expense.

97
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm not ill, I'm in pain.

98
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:31,041
Have a heart, Marina. I feel good here.
A deer came to my window in the night

99
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't ask much. A new bandage
now and then, a bit of iodine.

100
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,208
Just a few days.

101
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,541
Promise you won't show yourself?

102
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,750
Marina...

103
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,375
Make peace with your husband.

104
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,916
It was to protect you. That's to be praised.

105
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,625
You have 1 new message.

106
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,416
Has the time come yet?

107
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,666
No.

108
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,708
Send message.

109
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,250
What came over you yesterday?

110
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,416
It just happened.

111
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,416
One thing led to another.

112
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,958
I thought it was quite a big thing.
- Why did it scare you?

113
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,500
Your fanaticism scared me.

114
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,583
Such a bastard.

115
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,875
He wasn't too bad, I thought.

116
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,083
I didn't.

117
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,250
You nearly kicked him to death.

118
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,541
I'm here.

119
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,708
You were not to show yourself.
- Just a question.

120
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,250
This house is off-limits.

121
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,458
I simply long for a bath.

122
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,333
Isolde is asleep.
There's no one else in the house.

123
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,833
You've already had a bath.
- That was two days ago.

124
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,250
I am dirty, I stink.

125
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,166
You mustn't become a problem.

126
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,166
I've never been a problem to anyone.

127
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,583
Where's Mummy?

128
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,625
Mummy's downstairs.

129
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,333
Do you know the story of the white child
that floats above the clouds?

130
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,750
Shall I tell it some time?

131
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,916
Go back to bed then.

132
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,333
Don't worry. I'll be gone before he's inside.

133
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,083
Follow me.
- No, you'd better follow me.

134
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,375
Why?

135
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,416
That's impossible, Richard.

136
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,416
For you.

137
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,625
Yes, I can see that.

138
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,916
What am I to do with it?
- Just try it on.

139
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,541
I'm really annoyed
that you bought this for me.

140
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,416
The white child stood at the edge
of the lake in the forest.

141
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,625
She was very wary.

142
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:13,166
The lake was perhaps not very large
but it was known to be very deep.

143
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,000
Maybe as deep as a block of flats is tall.

144
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,375
And everybody knew that there was
something alive in it.

145
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,000
A beast.

146
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,250
A large beast with scales...

147
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:30,125
...and a beak with five hundred
small sharp teeth.

148
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:34,875
And that beast guarded
the golden key to happiness.

149
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,250
The white child cried.

150
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,958
Surely she couldn't dive that deep?

151
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,541
You're early. Off with you.

152
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,291
Isolde was crying. She had a nasty dream.

153
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,666
There was unrest. Now it's all right.

154
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,125
You're not allowed to be in here.

155
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,416
I want you to take that seriously!

156
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,916
She was crying.

157
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,000
If I hear a child crying I go and see it.

158
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,625
Stine comes home late,
just soaks in the bath.

159
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,708
Richard is asleep.
Nobody looks after the children.

160
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,833
Leave through the studio, please.
Richard is in the living room.

161
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,125
This is not what we agreed.

162
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,291
I'm sorry? What use is that to me?

163
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:22,000
Set the alarm.

164
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,083
I'm off.

165
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,958
Anton!

166
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,000
What's the matter?

167
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,333
Why are you leaving?

168
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,916
I'm bored. I want to play.

169
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,458
Don't you want to stay?

170
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,458
Not if I have to hide.
I want to eat with you at the big table.

171
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,000
Richard will have a fit.

172
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,291
That's why I'm leaving.

173
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,666
You mustn't go.

174
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,250
Can't you come back in another capacity?

175
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,541
It's possible.

176
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,416
But it will have consequences.

177
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,916
That gardener...

178
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,208
Do you have a special connection with him?

179
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,666
No...

180
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,041
Does he have a wife?
- Yes.

181
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,708
Hey, Camiel.

182
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,166
Brenda!

183
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,750
For you.

184
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,958
Yes, Brenda here.

185
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,666
Are you somewhere?

186
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,250
No problem.

187
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,125
Got the necessaries?

188
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,125
The necessaries. The material.

189
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,416
Two bags of mortar, four buckets
and a tub to mix it in.

190
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:00,791
And we need a car.

191
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:04,833
That's no problem.
You must look civilised. Immaculate.

192
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,541
I'll ring you about that.

193
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,208
Hello?

194
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,458
Anyone in here?

195
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,541
Jesus man, what's the matter with you?

196
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,083
I'm not well.

197
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,833
I'll ring a doctor.
- No!

198
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,000
Home first. I want to go home first.

199
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,291
Do you have a car? Can I take you there?

200
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,250
Please, please.

201
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,416
Where do you live?

202
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,291
Oh god, my darling.

203
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,291
Doesn't look good.

204
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,541
I'm going to call the doctor.

205
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:47,291
The doctor is on the way. I took
the liberty of ringing a specialist I know.

206
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,000
A specialist? In what?

207
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,125
Poisoning. Dr Kaper is a toxicologist.

208
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,750
Poisoning?

209
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,291
Your husband's been poisoned,
that's obvious.

210
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,625
Do you think so?
- Yes, I think so.

211
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,083
Poisoned who by in heaven's name?
- I have no idea.

212
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,041
Who could do such a thing?
My husband is all kindness.

213
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,958
Darling boy...

214
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,333
Darling boy, don't die please.

215
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,291
If anyone can save your husband
it is Dr Kaper.

216
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:18,916
Drinking a lot...

217
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,166
...always helps.

218
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,166
That's right.

219
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,333
Good afternoon, I'm Dr Kaper.

220
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,083
Good afternoon, I'm...

221
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,083
Very nice of you to come.
- No problem.

222
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:01,041
I brought my daughter along.
We were on our way to a wedding.

223
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,541
He has just lost consciousness.

224
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,500
You're thinking of poison?

225
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,000
This man's got to be taken to a hospital
double quick.

226
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,208
Everything will be all right, madam.

227
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,625
What are you doing?

228
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,000
I was looking for sand to mix through
my paint. I tripped over.

229
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:32,083
But darling, you don't need to tidy that up.
That's what the gardener is for.

230
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,416
The gardener resigned.

231
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,000
Why?

232
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,625
It was getting too much for him, he said.

233
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,750
Just like that?

234
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes, I think his wife is ill.

235
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,666
He didn't want to go into it.

236
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,708
Oh, Richard...

237
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,083
I'm so sorry.

238
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:06,166
You are my only real love.
You know that, don't you?

239
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,291
Of course I know that.

240
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,708
Sometimes everything seems unreal to me.

241
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:16,791
Do you think I'm hysterical?
- Not at all.

242
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,375
We must trust each other...

243
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,291
I trust you like no other.

244
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,416
...And love each other.
- Without you I'd be lost, really.

245
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,375
There is something that surrounds us.

246
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:37,708
Something that is outside us,
but slips in now and then.

247
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,708
A warmth...

248
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:43,000
...a pleasant warmth that intoxicates,
but also confuses.

249
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,250
The shell of something that means harm.

250
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,916
At least that's what I think. I'm not sure.

251
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,625
That's a delusion...

252
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,125
...a hallucination, it's tiredness.
You work too hard.

253
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,750
I feel so guilty.

254
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,583
We have it so good.

255
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,666
We are fortunate.

256
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:08,083
And the fortunate must be punished.
- Marina darling, that is nonsense.

257
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:12,458
We were born in the West, and the West
happens to be affluent. We can't help it.

258
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,041
What are you doing?

259
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:18,208
What are you doing out of bed?
- I'm hungry.

260
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,583
We're also hungry.

261
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:23,958
Come along then.

262
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,666
Look! Ludwig and Pascal.

263
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,916
Why didn't you stop?
- Yes, why didn't you stop?

264
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:24,041
What are you doing? Why didn't you stop?

265
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:27,041
Are we out of favour or what?
- Tell him he's a dickhead.

266
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,666
You're a dickhead.

267
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,291
I'm not saying that, Ludwig says it.

268
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,083
Oh, and Brenda and Ilonka
do come in handy?

269
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,125
How often do I have to explain?

270
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,625
I'm going to hang up.

271
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,791
Why? Because you're drivelling
like an old woman.

272
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,000
Hey, Camiel.

273
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:44,958
No, it's Pascal.

274
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,333
I was asleep.

275
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:53,958
We'll sort it out.

276
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,666
Where's Mummy?

277
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,083
In the bath.

278
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:23,583
What a bugger of a day.

279
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,750
Stornebrink?

280
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,875
He's trying to squeeze me out,
the bastard.

281
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,958
Found a new gardener yet?

282
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,958
There are five applicants coming tomorrow.

283
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,541
What time?

284
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,291
From two o'clock on.

285
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,208
I'll take over from you.

286
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,416
Why?

287
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:49,708
The last gardener was your choice.
Now it's my turn.

288
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,750
As you wish, darling.

289
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,000
You'll hear from me.

290
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,416
Shall I go?
- No, I'll go.

291
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:09,750
Hello, sir.

292
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,125
I've come to apply for the gardener job

293
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,666
Do you have any training? Diplomas?

294
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,833
No, sir.

295
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,083
Then why do you apply'?

296
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,000
Pascal...

297
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:09,541
An applicant do you think?

298
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,000
Can't be.

299
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,000
Fuck...

300
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,458
Sir...

301
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:56,500
Hi, I'm here for the vacancy
of a gardener.

302
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:57,875
We've already got one.

303
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,958
What the hell is that?

304
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,041
Again no use?
- A black!

305
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,791
Yes?

306
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,625
Good afternoon.
I'm offering my services as a gardener.

307
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,916
Or maybe you have already found one?

308
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:35,458
No, no. Please, come in.

309
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,833
Come through.

310
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,583
Marina, my wife.

311
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,500
Camiel Bergman.

312
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:58,416
Quite a garden. That isn't child's play.

313
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,000
Needs some work done.

314
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,416
May I take a look around?
- Certainly.

315
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,125
There's a blue moped outside the front door.

316
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,958
It belongs to that gentleman.

317
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,208
That gentleman may be our new gardener.

318
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:00,375
Is our gardener dead?
- No, he has moved.

319
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,916
To Australia.

320
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,916
Please girl...

321
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,166
Go get some help.

322
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,583
Please.

323
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:41,583
It needs a lot of pruning.
Some plants and trees will never thrive here.

324
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,708
Mowing, aerating, fertilising...

325
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,375
Then we remove everything we get rid of.

326
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,250
How long is it going to take?

327
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,750
Three weeks.
- Can't you do it faster?

328
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,833
I could, but I'd have to sleep here
somewhere.

329
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:57,666
There's no need for anything special.
A mattress on the floor will do.

330
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,083
The summer house.

331
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,708
There's a bed. A wash basin.

332
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:05,166
Why? We have a guest wing.

333
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,541
Will you two excuse me?

334
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:17,000
It may not have your interest, but
much more could be done in this garden.

335
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,250
What's the big idea?

336
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,583
Why did you have to make this kaput?

337
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,208
Why did you have to make this kaput?

338
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,333
Kaput?
- What did you say?

339
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,083
Kaput?
' Kaput!

340
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,708
Yes, and I'm asking you why.

341
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,875
That bear was lovingly put together
by human hands.

342
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,666
Maybe even by children's hands.

343
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:12,041
Children who haven't a life
as good as yours.

344
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,500
Children who can't go to school,
or to a doctor when they are ill.

345
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,916
That bear was brought to this country
in a plane or on a boat.

346
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:22,333
And then it went in a van to the city,
to the toy shop.

347
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,708
That bear has travelled
an enormous distance.

348
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:31,041
One day I was looking for a present for you
and I saw this bear in the shop window.

349
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:35,708
And Mummy had never seen
such a sweet bear before.

350
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,500
She bought it to make you happy.
But Mummy shouldn't have done that

351
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:42,750
Nothing gets deliberately broken
in this house! Understand?

352
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,291
Marina...

353
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,500
What? Something wrong?

354
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,583
Can't I tell off my own daughter?
Do you know better?

355
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,625
Come along, kids.

356
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,250
Isolde...

357
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,583
Mummy is very tired. She's overworked.
She doesn't mean it that way.

358
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,541
Darling...

359
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,833
I've got something to eat for you.
- Just leave it there.

360
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:16,000
Is Camiel your real name,
or do you have other names?

361
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,875
My name is Camiel.

362
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,916
You must eat something.
- I must?

363
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,916
Not must, but may.

364
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,750
It is good to eat when you're working.

365
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:36,125
It's rolls. They dry out quickly in the sun.

366
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:42,708
If you don't want to eat, tell me
and I'll take it away again.

367
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,625
I'm taking it back again.

368
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,291
If you're hungry, let me know.

369
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,958
Shall I leave the water bottle behind?

370
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:03,333
I'll put it in the shade.

371
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:05,958
I'm putting it down here.

372
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:10,416
You've got to look, or you can't find it.

373
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,166
Are you done?

374
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:15,666
Don't you have any feelers?

375
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:18,958
I am the new gardener.
I have an assignment.

376
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:23,916
You wanted to play, you said.
- I am playing.

377
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,041
I play at being a gardener.

378
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:42,166
Who are they?

379
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,791
Haven't they introduced themselves?
- No.

380
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,916
Guys... This is Marina.

381
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,041
Ludwig.

382
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,291
Pascal.

383
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,375
When the white child was missed
a search was organised.

384
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,833
In the village church,
people prayed to Jesus.

385
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:13,875
But as you know Jesus is a bloody bore,
only interested in himself.

386
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:19,416
That evening, heavily armed divers went
down to the bottom of the forest lake.

387
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:22,791
Fifteen minutes later they came up,
trembling with fear.

388
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,708
Couldn't speak a word.

389
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:28,375
What was it? What did you see?
the villagers asked.

390
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,458
It's no use, the eldest diver finally
stammered.

391
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,541
The beast is too big and the white child
has been swallowed anyway.

392
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:39,875
The white child's mother
fell to the ground, weeping.

393
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,541
I want my baby back, I want my baby back.

394
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,750
You can't mean that, said the diver.

395
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:51,500
Your child is in the beast's guts.
It's already half digested.

396
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:55,708
Now the mother stood up
and looked at the villagers.

397
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,041
Is no one brave enough to get my baby
so that I can give her a decent burial?

398
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,083
There was a silence.

399
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:09,125
But not for long, because Antonius,
the cripple, stepped forward.

400
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,958
I will fetch your child, he said.

401
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:18,291
EA chilly breeze started blowing
and the mother kissed Antonius' hands

402
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,666
Why are you doing this?

403
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,583
Why in God's name?
- What?

404
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:52,666
Do you hate me that much?
- I don't hate you at all. I love you.

405
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:55,958
Oh, it's for love
that you carve up my paintings?

406
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,791
You're disgusting.
- Marina... I was asleep.

407
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,333
I don't know what you mean.

408
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,750
I haven't done anything.

409
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,000
Wake up, it's not real.
- Don't touch me.

410
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:07,750
For Christ's sake, it's a dream.
- I can't stand you any longer.

411
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,333
Come in.

412
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,250
No, I'm not coming in.

413
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,708
I want you to come here.

414
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,708
I'm watching TV.

415
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:44,041
I can't bear it any longer, Camiel.

416
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,375
Touch me, please.
- Impossible.

417
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,791
Kiss me.
- I can't kiss you.

418
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:52,041
You are Richard's wife.

419
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:54,375
Richard is my superior. He is my boss.

420
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:57,500
Seriously. Never mess around
with the boss's wife.

421
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,625
Touch me.

422
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,500
I cannot touch you, Marina.

423
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,875
Not yet.

424
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:07,625
You've come too soon.
- Camiel, it's getting exciting.

425
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,458
The friendly chemist
turns out to be a serial killer.

426
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:11,916
Yes, I'm coming.

427
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,958
Have faith.

428
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,583
And patience.

429
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,166
What's the matter?

430
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:18,125
Nothing.

431
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,291
What's the time?

432
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:22,458
The children... Where are the children?

433
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,000
I don't know, I've got to go.
- Wait a minute.

434
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,791
They must go to school.
- Doesn't Stine do that?

435
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,958
Stine has the day off.

436
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:33,750
You take them.
- I'm seeing Stornebrink and I'm late.

437
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:36,708
Fuck Stornebrink,
you're taking the kids to school.

438
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:40,708
It's too important. It's make or break now.
I can't afford any mistakes.

439
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:43,333
You never do anything for the children.

440
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,750
Where is Stine?
- She has a day off.

441
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,500
Who is taking us to school?
- Daddy.

442
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:34,375
Camiel?

443
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,291
Look, here's your dog.

444
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:20,458
Are you back again?

445
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:26,208
They're a bit tired.
Shall I put them in front of the TV?

446
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:29,291
They had a long day.
- Get them to pick a nice film to watch.

447
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:49,458
If you feel like it.
You could also just walk around.

448
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:01,625
Guys, this is Arthur.

449
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,125
Can he watch the film with you?

450
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:31,833
Glass of wine?
- No thanks. Tap water with ice and lemon.

451
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,541
No wine?
- Didn't I say water?

452
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,541
Has something happened?
- No.

453
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,583
We've got guests?

454
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:43,375
The gardeners are eating here.
And Stine.

455
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:45,916
And her boyfriend.

456
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,583
Aha, Stine's boyfriend?

457
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:12,708
That's right.

458
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,666
I'm Arthur Stornebrink.

459
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:20,416
I'm Richard. We'll talk later.
I'm going to freshen up first.

460
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:34,458
Can I help you?

461
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,916
You could peel the potatoes.

462
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,791
What's Stine got up to?

463
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,833
Arthur, go and see what she's doing.

464
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:10,375
I'm looking for Stine.

465
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,541
She's gone to the kitchen
with a bunch of flowers.

466
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:17,833
We must have just missed each other.
- That's quite possible.

467
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,541
I'm Arthur.
- The soldier.

468
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,541
Yes.

469
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,166
We'll see each other at dinner.

470
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,541
Everything's fine. Get some fresh air.

471
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:22,791
Everything's fine?

472
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,041
Wait a minute.

473
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,125
No wine. Put those bottles away.

474
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,958
There will be no alcohol served tonight.
- Don't be ridiculous.

475
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,541
No alcohol? Why?

476
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,958
We'll take no alcohol so that we all
stay sober and emotions don't run high.

477
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,916
What's wrong with emotions?

478
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,541
Yours are running high
without a drop of alcohol.

479
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,833
Have I ever lost control of myself?

480
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:57,625
You want me to answer that?

481
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,958
I am an adult. I decide what I drink.

482
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,083
Yes, but not tonight in this kitchen.

483
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:05,916
And that's up to you?
- Yes, that's up to me.

484
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:08,166
I'm leaving.

485
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:16,041
Don't get all screwed up.
Think of the children, our guests.

486
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,500
Why no alcohol?
What childish stuff is that?

487
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,291
We must keep our wits about us.
- I don't want to.

488
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:23,208
Look at me.

489
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,583
I've been fired.

490
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,041
Arthur, do you still live at home?
- Yes.

491
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,708
And in the barracks of course.

492
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:03,416
And are your parents still together?
- Yes.

493
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,708
Are you interrogating the boy?

494
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:08,083
The boy doesn't mind. Do you, Arthur?

495
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:11,333
Not at all, isn't that what I'm here for?

496
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,041
What for?
- To be interrogated.

497
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,708
So Stine said.

498
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,791
Well, those weren't my words.
I wanted to get acquainted.

499
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,291
I'm not bothered, you know.
I've got nothing to hide.

500
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,708
What does your father do,
now that we're at it?

501
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,791
He's with a TV production company:

502
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:34,166
Q-Entertainment.
- So he's a big shot?

503
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,458
So he also fires people?
- He hardly ever does.

504
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:41,541
Except if there's no other solution.
- That right?

505
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:43,541
He actually fired a man today.

506
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,458
He told you?
- Yes.

507
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:49,750
He came home all emotional.
- Why?

508
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,833
The man he sacked
was once a friend of his.

509
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:55,916
But recently he turned into
an unreliable bastard.

510
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,750
Unreliable bastard.

511
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:00,166
Did he say that?
- Yes, he did.

512
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,166
He was manipulating my father
out of the company.

513
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,000
But he failed?

514
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,041
Yes, my Dad is not easily foxed.

515
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,333
Your father is a liar.

516
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,958
Why? What do you know about it?

517
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:15,041
Your father is the unreliable bastard.

518
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,208
Are you a colleague or what?

519
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,125
Tell me what's what.

520
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,750
I won't have my father insulted.

521
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:28,000
A guest? I'll knock his teeth out.
- Your father was playing a sneaky game.

522
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:32,333
Richard, let it rest.
- So you nearly ruined his company.

523
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,541
It was my company, jerk.

524
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,541
Shut up.

525
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:38,625
Can he help being Stornebrink's son?

526
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,333
I'll bash your face in.

527
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,458
No, I'm going to sleep.

528
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
The little guy is tired.

529
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,583
No, that's not necessary.

530
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:21,333
No, thanks.

531
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,541
Daddy was a bit cross.

532
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:23,166
But that's all over now. Right, Daddy?
- Yes, it's all over.

533
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,375
It's Isolde's birthday tomorrow.

534
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,583
So what?
- I want an aquarium.

535
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:34,666
Nothing is celebrated in this house.

536
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:39,541
Daddy is sad. That's why he is saying
unpleasant things.

537
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:42,875
Tomorrow we'll celebrate your birthday
as usual.

538
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,541
Can I talk to you?

539
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:54,875
There's ice-cream in the freezer.

540
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,791
Do you have any idea what's going on?

541
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:07,333
I do.
- Do you realise what happened today?

542
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,333
You were fired.
- Yes?

543
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,125
But not in any old way.

544
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,583
Jesus, you have no idea...

545
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:17,791
I walked straight into the trap,
like a toddler.

546
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,583
I totally underestimated my enemy.
- Richard...

547
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:23,291
Think of the children, just sitting there.

548
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,125
It's a lot worse.

549
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,541
What is it?
- Yes, what is it?

550
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:31,791
How did you get it?

551
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:33,875
I'm scared, Marina.

552
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,875
It appeared suddenly.

553
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,791
I've been marked.

554
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,916
Marked? Who by?

555
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,125
Sleep well.

556
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,333
Leo, what's wrong?

557
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm tired. I want to sleep.

558
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,083
Isolde, what's the matter?

559
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,958
Tired as well?

560
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,458
Yes.

561
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:23,958
This is not right.

562
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,416
I'm going to phone Dr Baumgarten.

563
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,500
Yes?

564
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:25,916
Dr Baumgarten?

565
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:27,666
Yes?

566
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:35,958
Is it serious?

567
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:40,666
Have their summer holidays started?
- Yes, as per today.

568
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:42,333
Just as I thought.

569
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,000
The children are overtired.

570
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,125
Overtired? Because of what?

571
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,208
Because of the modern world.

572
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:54,083
Don't forget they have a lot to cope with
these days: TV, internet, school.

573
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:58,458
In the holidays
the child's body will give up.

574
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,250
But all three overtired at the same time...
that's very strange.

575
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,000
Maybe there's something else?

576
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,291
For instance?

577
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:11,291
Tensions in the family?

578
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,666
There's nothing like that in our family.

579
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,958
Good thing, too.

580
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:35,333
You lie down, little girl.

581
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,291
On your tummy, please.

582
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:04,416
Come along, darling.

583
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:07,250
It's time for love. Time for consolation.

584
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:28,166
Have you gone crazy?!

585
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:30,125
Now what have I done?

586
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,541
Bastard.

587
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,708
That's enough.

588
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:45,333
You fucking bitch!

589
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,541
Wake up!
- You disgust me!

590
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,291
He's got to die, Camiel.

591
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,916
Richard must die.

592
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,708
Please.

593
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:33,750
If that's what you want.

594
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,500
I want it.

595
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,416
As soon as possible.

596
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,916
Can we get UP?

597
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,791
Are you better now?
- Yes.

598
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,333
Yes.

599
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,083
Yes.

600
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:10,958
Just for an hour, and then back to bed.

601
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,958
No, don't.

602
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,750
I've had it removed.

603
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,000
The tattoo?
- Yes.

604
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,291
I feel a lot better.

605
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,916
Richard...

606
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:08,791
Camiel.
- You're just in time.

607
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:32,041
I AM - WE ARE

608
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:05,125
Come along, kids.

609
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:12,291
Would you two like a drink?

610
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:15,833
A glass of wine. Same for you?

611
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:31,416
Can I go and wash my hands?
- Go ahead.

612
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,625
Can we have an ice lolly?

613
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,833
Of course.

614
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:01,500
Here, you give this to Dad.

615
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:03,791
I'll bring the ice lollies.

616
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,625
Isolde...

617
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,208
Give Daddy a little kiss.

618
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,500
Daddy...

619
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,791
Is that for me?

620
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,000
Thank you, darling.

621
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:27,000
Shall I give you a kiss?

622
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:29,333
Oh, yes please!

623
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,041
Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, darling.

624
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:08,666
Here's to the garden.

625
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:17,541
Where are the others?
Don't they want a drink?

626
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,958
I could call them, but they're very tired.

627
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,833
I'll leave you two alone then.

628
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:32,375
Sleep well.

629
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:40,916
Stine...

630
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:55,166
And?
- Nothing yet.

631
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:23,916
It's started.

632
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:48,541
Let me have a look.

633
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:51,625
Marina...

634
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,625
This is Brenda.

635
01:38:57,625 --> 01:38:58,916
Brenda.

636
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:02,250
And this is Ilonka.
- Everything will be all right, madam.

637
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:13,625
Sit down, please.

638
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:15,666
Marina?

639
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,833
A drink?

640
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,166
Pascal knows where it is.

641
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:47,833
Richard is still there.

642
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:51,666
Under the piano.
- So I noticed.

643
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:54,875
Shouldn't he be removed?

644
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,083
Why?

645
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,375
Why all these people?

646
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:04,083
I want to be with you.
- You are with me, aren't you?

647
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,750
Haven't you got something for me?

648
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,875
I feel so screwed up.

649
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:21,375
