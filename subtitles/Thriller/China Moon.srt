She was in Miami,

816
01:07:52,671 --> 01:07:53,905
at the Registry Hotel.

817
01:07:55,674 --> 01:07:58,343
Checked in Thursday last,
checked out Monday morning.

818
01:07:58,376 --> 01:08:02,013
Now, Saturday night at 9:37,
she called her husband here.

819
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:05,717
Got him just
before he went out.

820
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:08,586
At 11:41 p.m.,
she called him again
at the Brayton Country Club.

821
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:11,890
She said she didn't
make any calls
from the hotel.

822
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:13,024
Yeah, that's what she said.

823
01:08:14,325 --> 01:08:15,193
Sunday,

824
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:19,230
at 10 a.m.,
she had brunch, poolside.

825
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,600
Stayed there all day.
They got her signature
and everything.

826
01:08:23,702 --> 01:08:25,303
What do you think?

827
01:08:25,336 --> 01:08:27,038
I don't know.

828
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:29,040
She was in Miami.

829
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,208
Maybe she got one
of her lover-boys

830
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:32,143
to come over here
and kill him.

831
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:33,679
Maybe.
Maybe you're guessing.

832
01:08:35,914 --> 01:08:36,748
No, I'm not.

833
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:39,985
Hell, everybody knows her.

834
01:08:40,018 --> 01:08:41,019
She's gonna get
a load of dough.

835
01:08:42,353 --> 01:08:44,022
Don't it bother you
how come she's so nervous?

836
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,257
You think she's nervous?

837
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:51,663
What do you think she is?

838
01:08:51,697 --> 01:08:54,165
She's got a reputation
all over town for
having her way with men.

839
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:55,266
Is that so?

840
01:08:56,234 --> 01:08:57,335
I've heard stories, yeah.

841
01:08:58,203 --> 01:08:59,237
What kind of stories?

842
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:02,708
She used to entertain men
when her husband was away.

843
01:09:04,943 --> 01:09:06,177
Who told you that?

844
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:07,846
Oh, come on, Kyle.

845
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:09,380
What do you think
is goin' on here?

846
01:09:09,414 --> 01:09:11,182
There was nothing
in the car,

847
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:13,218
not a fingerprint.

848
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:14,886
Rupert Munro
was a big guy.

849
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,222
So wherever he went,
somebody carried him.

850
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:18,857
You know she got
one of her lover-boys

851
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:19,891
to come over here
and kill him.

852
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:22,093
Where would
they put the body?

853
01:09:22,894 --> 01:09:23,729
You tell me.

854
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:27,298
LAMAR: It was raining
so hard that night,

855
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:30,368
no one's gonna dig a hole
in the mud in rain.

856
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:32,904
(DOOR OPENING)

857
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:36,975
Hello, sugar.
Hi.

858
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:39,911
Thanks a lot.
How's it going inside?

859
01:09:39,945 --> 01:09:41,379
Ah, we haven't found
anything yet.
All right.

860
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:47,819
Here she comes.

861
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:53,391
I brought you
some lemonade.

862
01:09:53,424 --> 01:09:55,193
It's fresh.
I made it this morning.
Thank you.

863
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:57,095
Thank you.

864
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,332
KYLE: Who was in your
hotel room in Miami?

865
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:02,600
RACHEL: What?

866
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,770
Who called Munro
from your room?

867
01:10:07,405 --> 01:10:08,005
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

868
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:10,007
You know.

869
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,842
You put someone in there
and you came up here
to kill him.

870
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:13,711
I didn't.

871
01:10:13,744 --> 01:10:14,879
Tell me the truth,
God damn it!
Oh, please. I am.

872
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:19,650
Nobody was there.

873
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:22,887
Somebody's lyin'.

874
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:25,656
This doesn't make any sense.

875
01:10:31,496 --> 01:10:32,763
Kyle.
Mmm.

876
01:10:32,797 --> 01:10:34,932
Just got a call.

877
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:37,435
Someone saw a car last week
parked up by Camelia lake
at night.

878
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,271
A shiny black car.

879
01:10:40,305 --> 01:10:41,439
Who made the call?
Anonymous.

880
01:10:57,688 --> 01:10:58,456
MAN: Find anything?

881
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:00,525
DIVER: Can't see anything.

882
01:11:01,826 --> 01:11:02,760
WOMAN: We got nothing.
We're coming in.

883
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:04,729
Maybe we'll have
to come back.

884
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:06,764
You think it's here?

885
01:11:07,432 --> 01:11:08,265
I don't know.

886
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,801
I need a hand.

887
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:14,739
So that's it.

888
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:16,907
WOMAN:
Wait. Wait. Uh, I think
we got somethin'.

889
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:19,810
Oh, Jesus.
I think we got him.

890
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:57,314
Think it's him.

891
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,818
Got yourself
a big ol' murder, Kyle.

892
01:12:10,895 --> 01:12:13,130
From the patent
decomposition of the body

893
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,933
and water temperature
of 72 degrees,

894
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:17,902
it is estimated the deceased

895
01:12:17,935 --> 01:12:20,671
has been in the water
for a period of seven days.

896
01:12:20,705 --> 01:12:21,906
Last Saturday.

897
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:24,642
DR. OCAMPO:
The body evidence says
two gunshot wounds,

898
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:27,878
medial thoracic perforating
the lower third
of the sternum.

899
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:30,815
Evidence of slight
powder flecking.

900
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:32,917
No evidence of exit wound.

901
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:36,086
Uh, second wound is
above the right eye.

902
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,122
Patent evidence of powder
and gas scorching.

903
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:42,126
Exit wound, uh,
lateral to second vertebra.

904
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:48,499
You're gonna get a bullet.

905
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:53,504
Bit smashed up,
but a bullet.

906
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:56,974
May I?

907
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:06,984
Let me see.

908
01:13:13,023 --> 01:13:14,892
Looks like a .38.

909
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:17,127
Yeah. Maybe a 9-millimeter.
Practically the same.

910
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:17,995
Let's measure it.

911
01:13:19,697 --> 01:13:20,731
Lee, can I have
the caliper?

912
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:24,569
Thanks.

913
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:36,413
LAMAR: A .38.

914
01:13:39,884 --> 01:13:40,985
Something wrong?

915
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:45,756
LAMAR: What's wrong?

916
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:51,996
(KYLE GRUNTS)

917
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:53,063
No, that's a .38.

918
01:13:57,902 --> 01:13:59,837
Here's a surprise for you.

919
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,839
What?

920
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:03,007
DR. OCAMPO:
There's water in the lungs.

921
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,975
So?

922
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:08,979
Two gunshot wounds in him,
and he was alive
at the bottom of the lake.

923
01:14:09,013 --> 01:14:10,848
Cause of death,
asphyxiation by drowning.

924
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:23,628
Kyle.

925
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:30,234
Look what's stuck
in the heel of his shoe.

926
01:14:30,267 --> 01:14:31,736
What is it?
Glass.

927
01:14:40,745 --> 01:14:42,212
I can't be sure yet,
but this looks like

928
01:14:42,246 --> 01:14:44,749
the original
Victorian glass.

929
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:47,918
I think it's the same kind
you found on Munro's shoe.

930
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:49,854
This is where it happened.
KYLE: Maybe.

931
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:52,923
Her lover-boy or someone
came in.

932
01:14:54,024 --> 01:14:55,893
There was a struggle.

933
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:59,163
The victim was hit
in the head and shot twice.

934
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:02,099
Thinking he killed him,
he took him to the lake
and dropped the car.

935
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:06,537
We have no fingerprints
in the whole place.

936
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:08,072
He knew what
he was doin'.

937
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:09,740
He wiped
the place clean.

938
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,177
I think he ran
the damn humidifier

939
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,945
to melt down
the prints.

940
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:17,715
We'll find a print somewhere.

941
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:18,883
We should.

942
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,885
We know he was here.

943
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:00,124
Kyle, we found something.

944
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,931
My, my.
Look what we got here.

945
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:14,071
Dig it out.

946
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:22,246
Well, Kyle,

947
01:16:23,147 --> 01:16:25,115
you were right.

948
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:26,951
Sooner or later,
they all fuck up.

949
01:16:27,952 --> 01:16:29,086
(HAMMERING)

950
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,275
Look at that.

951
01:16:52,276 --> 01:16:52,777
A perfect .38.

952
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,112
Look at them riflings.

953
01:16:57,147 --> 01:16:58,949
Gonna be easy
to match this to a gun.

954
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,186
All we need now
is the gun.

955
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:22,006
Who was with you in Miami?

956
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,042
I was alone.

957
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:29,279
You been sleeping with
anyone other than me?

958
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:30,848
No.

959
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:33,984
Uh, why are you
asking me this?

960
01:17:36,353 --> 01:17:37,988
I've been hearing things
about you.

961
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:41,191
Don't let them
do this, Kyle.

962
01:17:42,727 --> 01:17:43,961
You said they would try
to change your mind,

963
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:45,195
and now they're doing it.

964
01:17:48,132 --> 01:17:50,000
Where's the gun?
What gun?

965
01:17:50,034 --> 01:17:52,002
The gun
you shot him with.

966
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:53,971
You threw it away
at the truck stop.

967
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:55,139
That was a 9-millimeter.

968
01:17:55,172 --> 01:17:55,973
I know.

969
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,442
(EXHALES)

970
01:17:58,475 --> 01:18:01,145
What are you saying?

971
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:04,148
The bullet they took out
of your husband's body
was shot from a .38.

972
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:07,451
The bullet they took out
of the wall today was a .38.

973
01:18:07,484 --> 01:18:09,319
But I shot him
with a 9-millimeter.
You saw it.

974
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:17,094
BALLISTICIAN:
This is the bullet that was

taken out of the wall
at Munro's house.

976
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:21,732
This is the bullet that was
taken out of Munro's body.

977
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,169
The riflings match perfectly.

978
01:18:25,202 --> 01:18:27,304
They were both fired
from the same gun.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

980
01:18:29,173 --> 01:18:32,076
What are the pits
on the bullet that
came out of Munro?

981
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:33,177
I don't know.

982
01:18:34,144 --> 01:18:37,147
Sand will pit a bullet
like that, won't it?

Something about
the Munro case.

995
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,551
Kyle, now were
you seein' her?

996
01:19:48,552 --> 01:19:50,354
No.

997
01:19:50,387 --> 01:19:52,522
You never went to
see her alone
in her house?

No, sir.

Y'all were called out
there, weren't you?

Yes, sir.

Yeah. A couple times.

Her husband filed
a complaint with us.

LAMAR: He didn't
say nothing, Captain.

1007

1008

LAMAR: Yes, sir.

01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:26,056
Well, you took
a special interest
in this one, didn't you?

No, not really.

I was at home.

1016

Munro was shot
with a .38, wasn't he?

01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:46,543
KYLE: According to
the autopsy report, yeah.

1018

You carry a .38 special,
don't you, Kyle?

You know I do.

1021
01:21:06,396 --> 01:21:07,965
You fired this recently?

1022

Yes, I have.

We recovered a bullet
from that bedroom wall.

The rifling marks
are clean.

Won't be too hard to tell
if it came from your gun.

You're the one who
gave him the wrong gun.

What are you
talkin' about?

1035

Wrong serial number.
You didn't give him
your gun.

see you again.

Got to tell you, Kyle,

1039

you got a lot
of people upset

who can't believe you've
done somethin' like this.

1041
01:23:04,048 --> 01:23:06,316
Did you see her socially
at any time?

1042
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,184
No.

1043
01:23:09,219 --> 01:23:12,356
The night you met her,
the bartender showed you
a credit card receipt

1044

with her name on it.
Mmm-hmm.

No.

here at the office?

No.

Who was?

01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,704
I don't know what calls
you're talkin' about.

1051

her for, Kyle?

to her house to see her?

she had in mind all along,
don't you think?

Rupert was going to
leave me with nothing.

1082
01:26:38,995 --> 01:26:40,430
Lamar told me
how to do it all.

1083

How to do what?

1084

It changed after I met you.

1092

I came back from Miami
to be with you.

1093

You didn't even
check out of the hotel.
You came back to kill him.

from your room?

somebody in there.

from your room?

I don't know.
I just wanna
know the truth.

like that, Kyle, please.

Stop it!

why didn't you tell me?

I went to school
on you, Kyle.

1134
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,679
You sure did.

1135
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:44,548
I listened to
everything you told me.

1136
01:29:45,549 --> 01:29:46,750
I knew you did it.

1137
01:29:57,193 --> 01:29:58,862
You made too many
mistakes, Lamar.

1138
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,532
What are you
talking about?

1139
01:30:05,034 --> 01:30:06,436
You took this,
didn't you?

1140
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:09,573
I don't see
my name on it.

1141
01:30:09,606 --> 01:30:11,174
You see the compass
on your dash?

1142
01:30:18,782 --> 01:30:21,217
How did you know about
the $12 million trust?

1143
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,220
She tell you?
Why would she do that?

1144
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,456
Maybe you were
gonna help her
kill her husband.

1145
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,724
I didn't. You did.

1146
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,229
Yeah. But you're going to
jail with me anyway
because of this.

1147
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:34,197
You see?

1148
01:30:35,599 --> 01:30:37,567
It's all pitted from sand,

1149
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,439
just like the bullet
they took out of Munro.

1150
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:46,776
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1151
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:49,546
You switched my gun,
didn't you? My .38.

1152
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:51,080
You shot it into sand

1153
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:52,882
and then you got the bullet.

1154
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:54,618
In the autopsy room
when nobody was lookin',

1155
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:56,586
you switched it with
a 9-millimeter slug

1156
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,622
that they pulled
out of Munro's chest.

1157
01:31:01,257 --> 01:31:03,560
No one's gonna believe that.

1158
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:05,929
Then you fired
my .38 into the wall
at Munro's house.

1159
01:31:05,962 --> 01:31:07,564
So the slug from the wall

1160
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:09,232
and the slug
from the body match.

1161
01:31:09,265 --> 01:31:10,800
And they're both
from my gun.

1162
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,104
You got a desperate
imagination, my man.

1163

(SIGHING)

1164
01:31:18,742 --> 01:31:20,977
How did you know
where the body was?

1165
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:23,747
Did she tell you?

1166
01:31:26,116 --> 01:31:27,384
What do you think?

1167
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:28,585
I don't know.

1168
01:31:31,255 --> 01:31:33,490
All you got to do
is to get the mileage
from the car.

1169
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,127
And you know how far away
the lake is.

1170

Get up,
you son of a bitch.
Ah.

upwards, Kyle.

Let's go.

1173
01:32:02,286 --> 01:32:02,919
Sit down.

1174
01:32:04,788 --> 01:32:05,822
I told him everything, Lamar.

1175
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:10,627
Where's my gun?

1176
01:32:13,297 --> 01:32:15,132
I don't have it, Kyle.

It's in my car.

01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:38,455
If you've cooked up
something, Lamar,

1181
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:39,789
I'll blow your
fucking head off.

1182
01:32:42,526 --> 01:32:44,094
Let's go outside.

Are you gonna shoot me, Kyle?
If I have to.

01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,176
Well, you won't have to.

1189

How much were you in for?
A lot.

The lady was desperate.

1191
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:06,116
Then she wanted
to call it off,

1192
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:07,184
but the money smelled
too good.

1193
01:33:07,217 --> 01:33:09,153
Why me?

1194
01:33:09,186 --> 01:33:11,321
Why not some fucking bozo
off the street?

1195

Why did you have to go
set up your own partner?
It had to be you, Kyle.

Anybody else, you would
have cracked the case
