1
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,585
Bless me father for I have sinned 
in thought, word and deed.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,380
Would you like to tell me your sins?

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,991
Last night, I killed a man.

4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,814
I killed many men.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
It's who I am, it's what I do.

6
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,707
In fact, I'm supposed to kill
someone tonight.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,399
Tell me, why must this person die.

8
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:23,495
Because, he deserves to die.

9
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:25,534
You don't want me to try to
stop you, tonight.

10
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,515
I can't stop you,

11
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:30,294
won't stop you.

12
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,041
You're not the only one who 
has sinned, Father.

13
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,832
What's your darkest sin?

14
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,629
I was married once.

15
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:37,492
I did horrible things to
my wife and child.

16
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:39,594
What kind of things?!

17
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,085
I burned him. 

18
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:42,737
Scarred him.

19
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:44,438
He was hiding out.

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,349
Yes, I know ...

21
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:47,976
father. 

22
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:51,663

24
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:02,973
My God, I'm so sorry,

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm so sorry.

26
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,401
You're sorry!

27
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:08,919
I know, there are no words 
that I can say.

28
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,173
You're right.
There is nothing you can say.

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
I was a different man then.

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,874
You were supposed to love us,

31
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,612
protect us.

32
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:20,102
Now, you have after all this time,
no excuse.

33
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:22,724
I have made ...

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,710
terrible mistakes.

35
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,207
Mistakes!

36
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:28,872
You tortured me.

37
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,047
You killed my mother.

38
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:33,149
No, that's not true.

39
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,167
She commited suicide.

40
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:36,875
You really believe that?

41
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,268
Your mother was an ill women.

42
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:40,714
Made so because of your abuse!

43
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,069
No, she jumped.

44
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,495
She jumped from the balcony.

45
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,772
Have you told yourself your version
of the story so many times

46
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:47,928
that you actually believe it?

47
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,016
I know what happened.

48
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,754
I was there when she did it.

49
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,731
So was I.

50
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,979
It's because you're lazy

51
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,588
and you don't care anymore.

52
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,065
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me.

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
Don't hurt me.

54
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:25,374
Don't hurt me.

55
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:33,374
Come here.

56
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:34,873
Stay away from me, please.

57
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,166
Come here.

58
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,127
Stay away from me!

59
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:41,363
Get back in the fucking house!

60
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:42,576
Leave me alone!

61
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,527
You don't tell me what to do.

62
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,741
What are you gonna do?

63
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,937
Are you gonna jump?

64
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:53,924
Help me.

65
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:56,084
Well, go on, do it.

66
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,555
Do us all a favor, jump, 
jump, jump!   

67
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:00,925
Jump!  Do it! 

68
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,776
And, maybe, for once in your
miserable life,

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,419
you'll actually follow through
with something

70
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:07,813
and do it right.

71
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:14,843
Please. 

72
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,238
I can't take any more.

73
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,991
(mockingly)  Oh, ...

74
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,104
I can't take anymore.

75
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,688
(chuckles) I'm telling you, 
you better do this,

76
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:35,282
because if I get my hands on you,
you'll wish you had.

77
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,288
I'm so sorry.

78
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,568
You're pathetic.

79
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:52,036
I knew you'd never have the 
nerve to do ...

80
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:07,787
She jumped.

81
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:09,923
She jumped. 

82
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,195
I didn't kill her.

83
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:13,675
Of course you did!

84
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:15,947
You might not have pushed her, 
but you might as well have.

85
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:18,862
What choice did you leave her?

86
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,337
Endless beatings from you. 

87
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,249
Or, death.

88
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,754
That was my first lesson on how
cheaply we value life.

89
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,124
And, after you abandoned me,

90
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,670
I spent three days in that apartment 

91
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,775
until the building manager
found me.

92
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,690
I spent the next ten years, 
in and out of foster homes.

93
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,179
I didn't think anything could
be worse than you.

94
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:45,829
I was wrong.

95
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,764
Shall I tell you about the abuses?

96
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,787
How many old men laid their
hands on me 

97
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,350
and shared me with 
their friends?

98
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:55,432
Please, ... don't.

99
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,665
I've hated you for a lifetime.

100
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,769
Imagine my surprise when you
passed by me on the street.

101
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,976
At first thought, 
I wasn't sure it was you.

102
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,491
I think it was the collar 
that threw me.

103
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,176
So, I came back ...

104
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:14,957
and I waited,

105
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,332
and I waited,

106
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:18,915
and I waited.

107
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,505
Then, finally, you came out.

108
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:25,062
You walked right by me.

109
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:30,434
The second I looked into
your eyes, ... 

110
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,129
I knew it was you.

111
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,781
This person ... 

112
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,944
that you're going
to kill tonight, ...

113
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,686
is me, ... isn't it? 

114
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,779
