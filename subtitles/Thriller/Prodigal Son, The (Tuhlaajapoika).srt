00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,292
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,876
When are you going to stop treating me like this?

3
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:27,577
I don't know what you're talking about.

4
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,846
When are you going to stop being mad at me?

5
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,282
Listen carefully. I'm not going to say this again.

6
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:36,286
You and I broke up two years ago.

7
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,088
Especially when I struggled the most.

8
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:39,122
Look at you.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,858
You're the one who wanted to break up.

10
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,427
Yes, that's true.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,196
But I didn't expect you to turn your back on me so coldly.

12
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:48,331
If you really loved me,

13
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,034
you would've done your best to help me when I was in debt.

14
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:54,237
Hey. I was also struggling in the army.

15
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:57,307
Besides, you never helped me...

16
00:00:57,374 --> 00:01:00,610
like other girls who help their boyfriends in the army.

17
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,813
What? Have you already forgotten...

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,049
that I joined the army girlfriend contest for you?

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,585
Oh, that one.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,857
The one where you were supposed to send me a knitted scarf,

21
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:15,692
but you only sent a photo of it?

22
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,829
I'm sure...

23
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,364
Corporal Kim's girlfriend won the first place...

24
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,133
who wrote him a letter every day.

25
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,801
Wasn't it?

26
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,504
Oh, it was Private Lee's girlfriend...

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,905
who made lunch for everyone in the camp.

28
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,173
Oh, no, no. She wasn't the winner.

29
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,211
It was Sergeant Choi's girlfriend who always visited him...

30
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,613
even though it took her five hours both ways.

31
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,850
- Are you done? - My seniors...

32
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,284
punished me for over a year...

33
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,387
because you lied to the whole camp.

34
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:48,158
Is that so? I'm so sorry.

35
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,327
I won't ever date you again,

36
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,062
so you wouldn't suffer because of your liar girlfriend.

37
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,264
But why are you talking so much?

38
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:57,167
You even have a new girlfriend who carries a fake brand purse.

39
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,804
You look so desperate.

40
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,506
What did you say?

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,774
Desperate?

42
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:07,144
Oh, gosh. I was talking to myself. Did you hear it?

43
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,748
Look at you.

44
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,353
Right. Young Ha.

45
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:19,489
That's the person you are, but I've forgotten.

46
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,193
I can't stand how pathetic I am...

47
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:27,297
for going through all that to find you.

48
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,166
Anyway, it's enough.

49
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,068
Like I said before, I'm not someone who looks back.

50
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,637
I don't play push and pull either.

51
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,106
So stop lingering,

52
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,341
and be loyal to your new girlfriend.

53
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:46,049
Seriously!

54
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,086
He's beyond reason.

55
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,323
He's seriously beyond reason!

56
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,435
Kyung Ha?

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,371
Kyung Ha.

58
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,710
Hey, Seo Hee.

59
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:16,379
What was that? Did I catch you trying to ignore me?

60
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,048
I didn't know it was you.

61
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,182
Here.

62
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,917
Not at this hour.

63
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,020
You're always worried about getting fat, but you bought so much.

64
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:27,591
I bought everything he had, so he could go home.

65
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:30,160
You and Yong are so nosy.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,563
You're always on diet, but you bought a cake too.

67
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:34,764
Oh, this?

68
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,433
Someone gave it to me.

69
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,535
Who? Is today a special day?

70
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,771
Is it someone's birthday? No. An anniversary?

71
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:44,174
Stop guessing wrong.

72
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,343
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

73
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,545
You must be hitting it off well with the guy you met last time.

74
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,113
Believe whatever you want.

75
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,015
I'm going home. I'm tired.

76
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,184
Don't be so cheap.

77
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,787
Take this.

78
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:00,890
It's an expensive cake from a really famous place in Cheongdam-dong.

79
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:02,492
Bye.

80
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,928
Why would you give it to me if it's so expensive?

81
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,143
(Plumbing, Water leakage detection)

82
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:26,716
Yong.

83
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,786
I don't expect you to be from a conglomerate family,

84
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:34,224
but I wish you were born in a wealthy family.

85
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,899
(Director Nam Tae Il)

86
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,347
I'm back.

87
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,149
Let's get some tea after I'm done.

88
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,985
(Kim Young Ha)

89
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,726
Are you back, Mr. Nam?

90
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,528
Sure. I'd love to.

91
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,220
You're back, Director Nam.

92
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:38,488
What's he doing?

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,458
I don't know either.

94
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,727
He's here to work as a part-timer.

95
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,296
Could you please tell him to stop and just leave?

96
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,966
- Where's Mr. Lee? - He's in the kitchen.

97
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,104
Let me do it, Gwang Jae.

98
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,839
Go and clean the bathroom.

99
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:00,643
You think I'm gambling?

100
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,979
It's not true.

101
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,280
If that were true,

102
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,517
I'd put my head in a bowl full of water and...

103
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,653
Then where do you go every night? How dare you?

104
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,022
After Tae Il went on a business trip,

105
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,724
you never stay at home.

106
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,092
Am I wrong?

107
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,895
Please be quiet. I know that.

108
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,030
Hey, Mr. Nam.

109
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,399
You must be tired.

110
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,767
Nothing much happened here.

111
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,335
- Yes. Have you been well? - We have.

112
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,970
I'm back, Mr. Lee.

113
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,838
- Take a look at this. - Okay. Good work.

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,476
You should have gone straight home to take a rest.

115
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,279
You're so hardworking. Here.

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,215
You should take a look at it thoroughly.

117
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,918
I know you've taken a good look at it.

118
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,887
Well done, well done.

119
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:49,392
Gami would be nothing without you, Mr. Nam.

120
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,727
Don't you agree?

121
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,396
He's the best.

122
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,272
I'll go outside and clean the car.

123
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,140
Good luck, Mr. Nam.

124
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:09,979
Sir.

125
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:13,783
I saw Gwang Jae working as a waiter.

126
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,654
I don't know why,

127
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,856
but he suddenly wanted to work here.

128
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,291
So I told him to.

129
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,828
Why did he suddenly do that?

130
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,529
Why else?

131
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:29,165
He must have been sorry...

132
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,534
for hurting me so much by saying...

133
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,903
that he wanted to become a travel writer.

134
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,972
He's just like me.

135
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,208
He has weak spots.

136
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,480
Take good care of him, Tae Il.

137
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,648
I don't know how long it will last,

138
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,417
but still. Okay?

139
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,419
All right.

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,270
Gosh, why does he pee for so long when I'm cleaning?

141
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:09,973
Seriously.

142
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,912
Why is this so dirty?

143
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:18,915
It's filthy.

144
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,888
Come on!

145
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,524
Why am I going through so much trouble?

146
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:30,660
You got me.

147
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,665
Where is he?

148
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,702
I don't know.

149
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,738
Why aren't you in bed?

150
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:44,474
Why did you come here?

151
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,976
- Seo Hee called me here. - What?

152
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:52,615
- Gosh. - Congratulations

153
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,752
Congratulations

154
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,421
Congratulations to my dear family

155
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,123
Congratulations

156
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,091
Clap. Clap. I can't clap.

157
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,994
- Clap for me. - Gosh, turn on the lights.

158
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:06,429
I will if you blow this candle.

159
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,463
All right.

160
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:12,969
What day is it?

161
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,305
It's not.

162
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,474
She's just overdoing things.

163
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,011
We can't get in mood for anything.

164
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,680
Here, have some cake.

165
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,984
Where did you get the money to buy it?

166
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,552
It's not even your payday.

167
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,988
Can't you just eat it without asking me anything?

168
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,423
Try them.

169
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,091
It's from a really famous place.

170
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,260
How much did it cost...

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,196
to buy this?

172
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:43,499
It must be really expensive as it's from a famous place.

173
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,301
- Gosh. - Gosh, it hurts.

174
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,236
How much did it cost?

175
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,305
I don't know. I didn't buy it.

176
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,475
I don't know where good cake shops are at in Cheongdam-dong.

177
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,447
Then where did you get it?

178
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,419
Did your boss give it to you?

179
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,459
- It's delicious. - You only say it's delicious...

180
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,061
after knowing that I'm not the one who bought it.

181
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,230
Is it really from your boss?

182
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,733
- No, from his daughter. - What?

183
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,570
Maybe it's from the man Kyung Ha went on a blind date with.

184
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,308
- Did she go on a blind date again? - Yes.

185
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:29,112
Why did she give it to you?

186
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,313
I don't know.

187
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,081
Maybe it's because she didn't like him.

188
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,084
Or maybe it was because she did like him. It's either of the two.

189
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,686
Why would she give it to you...

190
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,187
if she liked him?

191
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,189
No one likes a fat woman.

192
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,592
She wants me to eat this and get fat instead.

193
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:45,561
Anyway, it's delicious.

194
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,563
What's wrong?

195
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:49,966
I need to get something.

196
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,504
Gosh.

197
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:05,842
What are you looking at?

198
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,512
They even imported the cups here.

199
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:10,713
They're from England.

200
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,716
These details must be important if you want to own a coffee shop.

201
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,956
Your head seems to be full of business ideas.

202
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,359
It's mostly filled with them.

203
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,764
How was your business trip?

204
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,200
I heard there are a few restaurants in Shanghai that won Michelin stars.

205
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,102
- Have you been to any? - No.

206
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,304
I haven't been to any.

207
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,440
That's a pity.

208
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,842
You must have worked all day there.

209
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,844
That's how it is.

210
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,216
But...

211
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,187
- I did get you a present. - Really?

212
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:52,889
Give it to me.

213
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:08,704
What's wrong?

214
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,608
I think...

215
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,744
the present is a little too much.

216
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,849
This looks like a proposal.

217
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,617
It's a bit too much.

218
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,356
Is it?

219
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,558
Of course.

220
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,962
When I get presents from my friends who went on a trip,

221
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:37,066
I usually get bottle openers, key rings, or magnets.

222
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,734
Those are the common ones.

223
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,239
Some even bring me salt in a bottle.

224
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Salt?

225
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,446
It's not important.

226
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:56,219
Anyway, I've never received a gift in a case like this.

227
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,223
It's not like there's a ring in there, right?

228
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,192
Well...

229
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,761
Is it a ring?

230
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:09,098
I...

231
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,111
Gosh. What's this?

232
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,581
- It can't be like this. - What?

233
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:29,218
- What do you mean? - I was going to open it,

234
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:32,121
and then give it back to you...

235
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,723
saying it looks too expensive,

236
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,325
but it's too pretty.

237
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,866
- Do you like it? - Yes.

238
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,469
That's a relief.

239
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,107
I didn't have time, so I asked our employee there to buy it for me.

240
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,610
I was worried it'd be too much because it's a ring,

241
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,079
but I had no time for anything else.

242
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,883
So I hope you don't think it's too much.

243
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,220
Is it really okay for me to have it?

244
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,221
Of course.

245
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:09,225
But you can't look for its prices on the internet.

246
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,060
It's cheaper than you think.

247
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,829
I feel much better now.

248
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,831
Thank you, Mr. Nam.

249
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,850
Where is it? Is it here?

250
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,319
Gosh.

251
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,488
Gosh, it's fine.

252
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,992
Stay still. I'll spray it for you.

253
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:46,529
Gosh, it's fine. Just leave me alone.

254
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,333
Why do your legs hurt?

255
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,936
Is it because you've been riding motorcycles instead of cars?

256
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,205
Your dad bought you a car.

257
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,506
Why don't you drive it?

258
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:59,175
It's not about that.

259
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,679
Gwang Jae. Get up.

260
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,315
Seriously. Mom. I'm going to sleep.

261
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,484
Leave me alone. I'm going to sleep.

262
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:15,591
Gosh.

263
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,832
I'm home.

264
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,202
He's been saying his legs ache for a few days now,

265
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,737
but he won't say why.

266
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,209
Gwang Jae. Put on the patches before you sleep.

267
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,846
Do you want me to massage you with hot water?

268
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,214
It actually works really well.

269
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,587
If they still ache tomorrow, let's go to the hospital together, okay?

270
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:47,857
It's upsetting.

271
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:54,563
By the way, did you just arrive from China?

272
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,832
Yes.

273
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,200
Did you have dinner?

274
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,503
I work in the restaurant, Aunt Soo Hee.

275
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:03,472
Get some rest.

276
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,250
Here?

277
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,185
More to the left. Yes.

278
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:18,020
Is it because you waited tables?

279
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,289
What do you mean?

280
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,161
You know I have so much work to do in the hall.

281
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:27,863
Why are you playing a waiter all of a sudden?

282
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:29,498
I'm not playing anything.

283
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,803
Undercover boss. Don't you know?

284
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,704
Undercover boss?

285
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,510
Are you really interested in restaurant business now?

286
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,712
That would never happen.

287
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,615
I was just bored. That's all.

288
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,119
Gosh.

289
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:54,890
Slide down a bit. I'll massage you.

290
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,692
- Slide down. - No, thanks.

291
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,060
You must be tired too. It's fine.

292
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,162
- Come here. - Hey.

293
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,934
Your father's still not home...

294
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,735
even though his only son is back.

295
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,171
Isn't it a busy season for Dad?

296
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,207
He's not idling.

297
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,242
He's working hard to feed his family.

298
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,377
I forgot you were here.

299
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,215
By the way, Myung Ha.

300
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:23,018
You didn't bring any of your stuff. Did you send them separately?

301
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,222
Actually, my bags didn't arrive in the airport when I landed.

302
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:29,425
They made a mistake, and my bags are in Nepal now.

303
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,459
My goodness.

304
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,861
- Nepal? - Nepal?

305
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,963
Your bags are traveling abroad alone?

306
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:37,666
Is that why you wore such ugly pants home?

307
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,135
Don't get me started.

308
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,636
I'm glad I was returning from China.

309
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,238
What if I was returning from Europe?

310
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:45,407
I almost jumped out of the plane because of her.

311
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,942
- Oh, gosh. - My goodness.

312
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,679
If someone so naive like Myung Ha can't handle,

313
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,215
she must've been a troublesome woman.

314
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,517
That's what I mean, Mother.

315
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,520
Do you have to return those pants?

316
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,054
I don't even know her number.

317
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,790
I didn't charge her for laundry. We're even.

318
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,759
You should've lied that they were expensive...

319
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,461
and charged her a lot.

320
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:08,764
What? You're talking like a swindler.

321
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,467
No, Grandma. I'm joking.

322
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,569
Goodness. Come on.

323
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:18,974
Anyway, I'm glad...

324
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:22,945
my adorable Myung Ha is back.

325
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,714
- Me too. Welcome back. - Yes.

326
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:28,217
- Welcome back. - Welcome back, my son.

327
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,499
Don't drink too much.

328
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,901
You'll have a headache again and suffer.

329
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,470
Mind your own business.

330
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,207
Is your dad leaving soon?

331
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,310
You should leave with him.

332
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:56,979
I should leave too?

333
00:19:57,246 --> 00:20:00,983
Yes. You can't live selling pork backbone stew forever.

334
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,819
You should go back to where you grew up.

335
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:08,257
Do you find me uncomfortable?

336
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,461
You worry about me too much.

337
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,129
I'm getting sick of it.

338
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,519
You must be tired from the business trip. Why are you still up?

339
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,558
You got a new car. Why aren't you driving it?

340
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:48,998
The new car only shines when you have someone to ride with.

341
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,202
Don't girls have to line up to sit in the passenger seat?

342
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:59,375
You know you seem to treat me like a womanizer.

343
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,210
You remind me of someone.

344
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,413
I don't know who that someone is,

345
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,483
but she surely knows what she's dealing with just like me.

346
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,820
I'm not in the mood for a joke.

347
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:14,823
What's wrong?

348
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,626
- What is it? - Gosh.

349
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,695
Nothing.

350
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,799
There's just this girl...

351
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,068
who doesn't get me at all.

352
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:27,970
Who is she?

353
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,074
I think we're really over. There's nothing to talk about.

354
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,410
But you want to work as a part-timer?

355
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,779
What's the reason?

356
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,950
That's over now. It wasn't that fun.

357
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,520
I knew it.

358
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:54,263
Your mom told me to go back to the US.

359
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:58,167
So?

360
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,169
Are you going to?

361
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,038
I'm thinking.

362
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,414
I...

363
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,384
always had a question.

364
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:19,722
Was it...

365
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,394
easy for you to call Aunt Soo Hee as mom?

366
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,232
It was awkward at first.

367
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,068
But...

368
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:35,704
I started to like her more as time passed by.

369
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:42,010
The fact that I have someone to call as mom.

370
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,480
I just liked that fact.

371
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:47,549
Mom.

372
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,519
It feels nice and cozy just by saying it.

373
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,489
I just liked it so much.

374
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:59,962
I didn't know what mom is until I became a teenager.

375
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,264
Then one day, all of a sudden,

376
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,200
I got a new wonderful stepmother.

377
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:07,569
It was nice.

378
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:11,907
The title of mom...

379
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,078
was like a genie out of the bottle.

380
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,983
Even when I ran out of toilet paper in the restroom, I'd call for her.

381
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,219
When I got in trouble at school, I'd call for her.

382
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,921
Every time I called her,

383
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,523
she showed up and took care of everything for me.

384
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,703
Tae Il.

385
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:43,872
Do you...

386
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,209
happen to know anything about my mom's past?

387
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,479
How would I know?

388
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,215
Have you heard anything from the adults?

389
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,118
No.

390
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,423
How can you know nothing about your own aunt?

391
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:06,228
I only met her a few times until I turned 20.

392
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:12,201
I'm going back inside. I'm tired.

393
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:16,171
What? Are you leaving again in the middle of conversation?

394
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,239
Tae Il.

395
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:20,976
Tae Il. You really need to work on your cold personality.

396
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,278
Girls these days hate it.

397
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,248
A cold city guy? That's so over now.

398
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:29,818
Sweet guys, cozy guys are in trend now.

399
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,387
Come on.

400
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,726
Seriously.

401
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,763
Kim Young Ha is stupid to reject a sweet guy like me.

402
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:55,143
No way.

403
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,781
Cleaning became my habit because of her.

404
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,206
Does Mr. Nam...

405
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,808
It can't be.

406
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,977
The employee was being too much.

407
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:36,718
What?

408
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,289
I threw this out. What's it doing here?

409
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,194
- Mom. - Yes?

410
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:47,796
Did you put this back in my room?

411
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,599
Yes. Why did you throw this out? It's in good shape.

412
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,201
Why did you put it back in my room when I threw it out?

413
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:54,770
Give it to me then. I'll use it.

414
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,972
- It looks like salt. - Never mind.

415
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:00,976
I thought it's something important because there's a paper inside.

416
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,811
- A paper? - Yes.

417
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,141
He left me.

418
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,210
What does he want now?

419
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,921
Your return to school is registered well, so don't worry.

420
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:47,389
Thank you.

421
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,757
- I'm leaving now. - Bye.

422
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,560
Myung Ha. I have a favor to ask.

423
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,763
It's not my favor,

424
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,165
but it's actually the dean's favor.

425
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,467
Tell me.

426
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,968
We're having a transfer student.

427
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:03,038
He wants to you help him until he adjusts to school.

428
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,741
I'm barely returning to school.

429
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:07,142
He's actually from China.

430
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,212
Please help us out. It could help you learn Chinese.

431
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,216
He's from a wealthy Chinese family.

432
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,752
It's probably worth knowing him.

433
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,287
Sure. Okay.

434
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,789
(Student Hall)

435
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,941
Goodness.

436
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,248
Goodness.

437
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,383
Goodness.

438
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,792
Whose shoes are these?

439
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,949
Gosh, that old lady.

440
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:24,119
What on earth is the passcode?

441
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,441
- Thief! - What?

442
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,110
I'm not a thief. Where are you going?

443
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,179
Help me!

444
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,949
Be quiet!

445
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:56,551
Hey.

446
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,257
What's all this noise?

447
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,061
- Grandma. - Goodness.

448
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:08,930
- Wait. - Mom.

449
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,799
What's going on?

450
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,635
What were you two doing?

451
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,669
Mom?

452
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,973
Young Ha's youngest uncle?

453
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:20,308
Hold on.

454
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,944
Did you just hit him with this?

455
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,313
Actually...

456
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:29,117
She tripped me and hit me so much, Mom.

457
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,486
Why did you do that?

458
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,389
Some black guy...

459
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,124
was trying to open the safe.

460
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:39,361
- I thought he was a thief. - Why would I open my mom's safe?

461
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,263
She's killing me twice.

462
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:45,033
- You were trying to open the safe. - No, I wasn't.

463
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,469
You're mistaken.

464
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,538
Wasn't beating me enough?

465
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,473
I saw it with my own eyes.

466
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,709
Young Ha's uncle tried to open the safe.

467
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:59,481
No, Mom. Oh, gosh.

468
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,537
(The Rich Son)

469
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,207
He swore at me and my boss.

470
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,608
I'll kill you, jerk!

471
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,143
If my oldest son finds out,

472
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,212
the whole family will go crazy like the last time.

473
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,713
Don't make me a bad guy anymore.

474
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:34,282
I beg you, Kyung Ha. Please!

475
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,718
You took the store deposit and ran away to Seoul alone.

476
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,220
You said you were going to make a theater company.

477
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,155
Hi. I'm Wang Mo Mong.

478
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,457
You get to live a luxurious life thanks to your husband.

479
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,159
What are you doing? This happens every time.

480
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,260
You don't know anything about me.

481
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,462
You can't even imagine my pain!
