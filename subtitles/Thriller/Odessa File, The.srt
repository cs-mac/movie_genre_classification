00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:29,022
3 hours ago

2
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,730
One warm doner for 2 o'clock.

3
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,379
Room 607, The Westin Grand

4
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:12,334
What do you have to say about
the missile test results?

5
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,706
Korean NIS Surveillance vehicle

6
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:18,734
The estimates you gave us were
off by over two kilometers.

7
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,211
Yuri, Russian arms broker

8
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,949
Our technicians were not
present for the test.

9
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,811
Smaller arms and the older
missiles are not a problem.

10
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,520
We worry about the new missiles.

11
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,295
Hey, what just happened?

12
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,923
We lost audio.

13
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:41,989
Do something.

14
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,901
Korean National intelligence Agency Berlin
Office The Russian's opening his laptop.

15
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,893
- Fix the damn audio.
- Hang on a second.

16
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:48,604
- Are you getting audio?
- They're not closing the deal yet.

17
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,005
Who's that pretty boy?

18
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,978
I'm not getting anything.

19
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,779
Nothing on CIA, MI6
or Mossad database.

20
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,915
What the..?

21
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:03,051
A ghost?

22
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,680
I haven't seen one
of those in a while.

23
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:09,160
If you don't purchase
the new missiles,

24
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,686
we will not provide the
additional weapons.

25
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,265
Assim, Anti-imperialist
Arab League

26
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:14,999
And then

27
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,902
we run another test with
North Korean technicians.

28
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:18,927
What do you say?

29
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,974
Somebody fix the goddamn audio.

30
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,308
Let me call you back.

31
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,846
Surveillance department North
Korean embassy, Berlin

32
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,919
I don't make the decisions.
I only follow orders.

33
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:44,996
You have the new
young leader now.

34
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:47,158
You must be more
flexible comrade.

35
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,194
Flexible?

36
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:54,138
You claim to oppose imperialism, but you
negotiate with this imperialistic logic?

37
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:56,303
Our terms are non-negotiable.

38
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,900
Lee Hak-su, North Korea's
ambassador to Germany

39
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,640
Excuse me.

40
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:13,758
What's the problem between you?

41
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,455
You came to sign the
contract, not negotiate.

42
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:25,502
This is the most reasonable
deal I've seen in years.

43
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:28,172
You're both being stubborn.
You're slaves to your pride.

44
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,199
We cannot match his
price in dollars.

45
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:32,643
And what about Euros?

46
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:34,942
I can speak to him
about that, at least.

47
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:38,877
Get the helpers ready.

48
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,528
First, you sign the papers,
then you bet the money.

49
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,019
The transfer first.

50
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,000
Action.

51
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,004
Action!

52
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:08,443
Okay.

53
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,418
Abort! Abort!

54
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,832
The deal is off. Get
the hell out of there!

55
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,382
This is the Mossad!

56
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:21,752
Our cleanup squad's
here in ten minutes.

57
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,181
Dagan, Mossad (Israeli
secret service)

58
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,324
Don't make this any worse
than it already is.

59
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,883
We can end this here.

60
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,459
We've got no interest
in your weapons deal.

61
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:35,866
We're only here for the
Russian broker and the Arab.

62
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:40,566
You've got plenty of other
clients to do business with.

63
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,743
Target on rooftop.

64
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,080
Proceed to service corridor
on the opposite side.

65
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:30,255
Distance to target 150 meters.

66
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,617
Come quietly.

67
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,018
They train you to put
the gun on the temple?

68
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:13,794
I just need to know the terms
and confirm the goods.

69
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,924
I turn my head and the
bullet misses me.

70
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,563
Alright, let's go.

71
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:37,046
Your spectacular screw-up

72
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,382
could reverberate all the way
to the Presidential House.

73
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:45,587
This is an absolute
diplomatic nightmare.

74
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:49,263
And for what gain?

75
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,469
We got the deal on tape.

76
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,937
Did you get the conversation?

77
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:55,764
Or the actual goods on tape?

78
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,133
You've got nothing to
confirm the deal terms.

79
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,374
No recording of
the conversation.

80
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,440
Exactly what do you have?

81
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:08,344
He put a gun to my face.
What proof do we need?

82
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,422
And because of that commie,

83
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,624
one of our men sustained a
severe injury to the spine.

84
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,360
We still can't escape blame
under international law.

85
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:19,897
You opened fire based
on speculation,

86
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:23,664
- at a person whose identity..
- Don't dump your crap on us!

87
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,902
For fuck's sake.

88
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:34,106
You've got no information on this
supposed North Korean agent.

89
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,481
Are we even sure we're
dealing with North Koreans?

90
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,983
Who's going to clean
up this mess?

91
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,448
Who?

92
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,855
Fuck..

93
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,290
Berlin unit under Chief Kang.

94
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,126
Prepare to be disbanded.

95
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,930
Mr. Inspector,

96
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:57,225
disbanding the team isn't
going to solve the problem.

97
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:00,930
A third country party
intervened at the scene.

98
00:12:01,073 --> 00:12:02,335
A third party?

99
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:03,897
Give me that.

100
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:07,745
It's not the weapons
trade we're after.

101
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:12,479
We're tracking down Kim Jong-il's
secret account worth 4 billion dollars

102
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,881
believed to have been moved from
Macau to Europe before his death.

103
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,289
If we find that account,

104
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,056
we get the upper hand in issues
regarding aid to North Korea.

105
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,063
It's unlike you to
make such mistake.

106
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:33,637
Yuri is an arms broker
wanted by the US government.

107
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,672
That explains how the South
Koreans knew about the deal.

108
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:38,976
But Assim is an
anti-American activist.

109
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:41,946
Why did Israelis show
up, not the Americans?

110
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,014
The leak must have come
from one of three parties.

111
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,812
Either the Russians sold the
information to the Israelis

112
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:50,015
or the Arab was a double agent
working for the Mossad..

113
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,583
Or it came from us.

114
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,792
Pyo Jong-seong.

115
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,898
Watch your mouth!

116
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:06,730
Jong-seong, listen
to me carefully.

117
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:11,007
Do you know who's on his
way from Pyongyang?

118
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,174
Dong Myung-su.

119
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:23,011
Why would they dispatch an
agent when you're out here?

120
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,755
They don't trust us.

121
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:32,258
Foreign offices are put under
scrutiny under the new leadership.

122
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:39,568
Even you, the Republic's
hero, need to be watched.

123
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,338
Take care where you tread..

124
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,704
Comrade Ambassador,

125
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,500
have you forgotten
what my job is?

126
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:47,878
I'm only saying..

127
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:52,076
I will not make an official
record of your statement.

128
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,118
Is that all I am to you?
An object of surveillance?

129
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,986
You're losing your focus.

130
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:29,379
These are all
speculations at best.

131
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,973
Where is intelligence?

132
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:33,948
Intelligence.

133
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:38,211
You gotta do better than this
to transfer to US office.

134
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:40,691
The agent in charge,
Jung Jin-su,

135
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,785
I heard he stirred up
trouble in Libya, too.

136
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:48,326
These old-timers hung up on
anti-communistic ideas are just burdens.

137
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:52,694
I prefer not to see his name on
your next report, understood?

138
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:56,371
I trust you'll take care of it.
Bring me results.

139
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:08,410
Man, I told you to stay clear
of Korean restaurants.

140
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:13,814
Are you pissed off at me
for not covering your ass?

141
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,257
It's my birthday today.

142
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:20,531
I felt like a bowl
of seaweed soup.

143
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:24,798
So, I came to this restaurant
where no Koreans come.

144
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:27,599
For a bowl of home-made soup.

145
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,570
I meant to give you a
heads-up about the account.

146
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,240
But I missed the timing.

147
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,948
That's your excuse? Timing?

148
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,711
Cut me some slack, man.

149
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:48,153
This is not some sloppy industrial
espionage job we're dealing with.

150
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,489
I have a political
position to consider.

151
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,792
Screw you.

152
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,232
What political
position with commies?

153
00:16:56,568 --> 00:17:00,368
I don't even make left
turns at intersections.

154
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:11,340
Anyone in my position
in any organization,

155
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,542
prefers to work with someone
that listens to you.

156
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,654
Do you know what
your problem is?

157
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,286
You make people uncomfortable.

158
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:36,173
Why are you sitting with
someone so uncomfortable?

159
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,271
Fine, I'll get off your face.

160
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:42,975
What do you want from me?

161
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,813
You can get rid of me.

162
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,291
You can transfer
to the US office.

163
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:59,119
But our man who got busted
by the commie today,

164
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:02,228
he'll be confined to a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

165
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,098
Just do your job.

166
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:11,234
I'll do mine.

167
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:50,338
We have a reservation under
the name, Ryun Jung-hee.

168
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:52,272
Upstairs, please.

169
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:53,942
He's already here.

170
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:59,814
He proposed this meeting.
So, he'll pick up the bill?

171
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,653
Didn't I tell you to take
off your wedding band?

172
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,398
It takes more than translation
skills to be a good interpreter.

173
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:21,307
There was a discussion at the bundestag
regarding North Korean diplomats

174
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:25,082
who got caught
smuggling cigarettes.

175
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,517
Caught smuggling cigarettes.

176
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,918
Why is German parliament concerned
with what happened in Austria?

177
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:34,923
Didn't we explain that it was
a simple misunderstanding?

178
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,294
If this becomes a pattern,

179
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,695
it's hard for them to help with
our medical supply issues.

180
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:43,567
They need to set a clear
position on the matter..

181
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:46,332
We payed him up out
of empty pockets.

182
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,869
And that's all he has to say?

183
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:57,639
22:00, Hackescher
Market tram stop

184
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:03,218
All I need is the grounds
to convince the parliament.

185
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:06,289
You know how things work.

186
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:11,961
Everything needs to be
recorded in Germany.

187
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:15,599
He is so shamelessly blatant
that it makes me blush.

188
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,733
Sick bastard.

189
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:24,071
Take a good care of him.

190
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:29,246
He wants a more
personal gesture.

191
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:58,842
They need to set a clear
position on the matter.

192
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:01,641
We payed him up out
of empty pockets.

193
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,178
And that's all he has to say?

194
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:07,149
All I need is something to..

195
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:34,509
Hey!

196
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,773
What brings you here?

197
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,281
Without calling me.

198
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,564
It's late.

199
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:00,198
Wash up and go to bed.

200
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:13,477
Take a good care of him.

201
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,297
Let me look at your wound.

202
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:28,697
It's not necessary.

203
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,371
Any news from Pyongyang?

204
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,604
What news?

205
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,113
We're way past due to return.

206
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:49,410
We don't make decisions.
We follow orders.

207
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,922
We can at least apply
for relocation.

208
00:22:57,595 --> 00:23:00,462
When did the comrades at the embassy
last had their self-criticism?

209
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,301
Can't you just ask me
why I want to go back?

210
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:13,433
I guess I thought wrong.

211
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:19,206
I forgot that you're Republic's
hero before you're my husband.

212
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:56,887
Oh my God.

213
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:59,146
Help! Somebody!

214
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:02,424
There is a dead woman here!

215
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:05,592
Waitress commits
suicide by overdosing

216
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,329
Let's find a new way to meet up.

217
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,932
Kids these days

218
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,336
they try these fancy
new techniques

219
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,304
always end up gettin' their
asses handed to them.

220
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:22,208
And these guys like you and me,

221
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:26,872
two old dogs, with old tricks,

222
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:30,818
- but we're still kicking.
- Enough with the old dogs.

223
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,113
You really makes us sound old.

224
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:36,591
I hate yo break it to the
pal, but we are old.

225
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:40,993
So, what can uncle Marty
do for his favorite ally?

226
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:47,236
I need to know if that
guy's in your database.

227
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,338
A North Korean?

228
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,041
White or Black Ops?

229
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:54,775
A ghost.

230
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,415
You heard about the Westin
Hotel kidnapping two days ago,

231
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:01,610
didn't you?

232
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:03,920
He was there.

233
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,183
And You were there too?

234
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,450
Ah, fuck..

235
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:10,126
You knew my team was tracking
Asim and his network!

236
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:11,962
Way to bend me over
the barrel, pal!

237
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:13,794
I had no time.

238
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:16,466
If I got that fucking commie

239
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,835
I was gonna hand over the
others as my Present.

240
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:20,270
What the hell with your present.

241
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:24,264
You told me you'd leak any intel you
had about the North's weapons deals!

242
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,610
And now, you tell me
the shit hit the fan.

243
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:27,942
Hey! Shut up. Please.

244
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:32,516
I got you a very
special present.

245
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,508
I got you a very
special present..?

246
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,010
Look.

247
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:41,057
A guy named Sigmund,

248
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,060
who is the German
ODA vice-minister

249
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:48,361
had a meeting with the
North Korean ambassador.

250
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:56,072
At the end, the ambassador
told his female translator

251
00:25:56,674 --> 00:26:00,303
to take good care of Sigmund.

252
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:06,449
I'm going home at the end
of the month, alright?

253
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,184
The only thing I want
on my plate right now,

254
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,786
- is my wife's home cooking.
- Hey. Hey, old dog!

255
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:10,776
Sorry.

256
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:15,354
Your Foreign Affairs
would love it.

257
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,695
What got you delayed?

258
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:30,106
I had to take care of
something upon my arrival.

259
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,302
I wasn't informed of your delay.

260
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,608
Watch this and
you'll understand.

261
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:40,148
Back then, orders never
contradicted each other.

262
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:42,919
They all had the same voice.

263
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,722
That's not how things work now.

264
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:51,227
The new Comrade Commander
doesn't like the old ways.

265
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,293
You recognize that woman?

266
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:00,233
Yes, it's my
favorite restaurant.

267
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:02,897
Germans like it, too.

268
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,304
So do the South Koreans.

269
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:19,246
They suspect you have a
leak in Berlin office.

270
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:21,658
It's not possible.

271
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:26,226
The most trustworthy is the one
to be watched most closely.

272
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,591
Comrade Stalin said that.

273
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,096
Did you inform the
Party about this?

274
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,965
I made a record of it.

275
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:39,705
Wouldn't it be better coming
from you than from me?

276
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:44,810
What if there is no evidence?

277
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:50,611
The Party says there is a
leak and you disagree?

278
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,118
That means the Party is wrong.

279
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:57,984
It makes the Party incompetent.

280
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,566
Say that again.

281
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:08,000
Who sold the information?

282
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,437
The woman..

283
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:15,505
The interpreter for the embassy

284
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:22,418
who made a reservation
under the name,

285
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,878
Ryun Jung-hee.

286
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,185
The waitress was an informant
for the South Koreans.

287
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,689
You know the
accusation is false.

288
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:36,426
Are you suggesting that Dong
fabricated the confession?

289
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,299
Whether it was fabricated
or not isn't important.

290
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:45,969
Your wife's name came
up in an inquiry

291
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:48,875
conducted by the
Security Department.

292
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,580
A name that Pyongyang
wanted to hear.

293
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:57,412
If you try to defend her when
the Party says she's guilty.

294
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:02,788
That makes you guilty, too.

295
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:07,826
There is no solid evidence
other than this confession.

296
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:13,793
Even you said that the leak
about the weapons deal

297
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,469
could have come from us.

298
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,041
For someone in my position, you
always have to have an answer

299
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:21,577
if not an alternative.

300
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,980
How much time do we have?

301
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,547
48 hours.

302
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:44,024
There's storm coming,
but no place to hide.

303
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:58,346
Are you sure it was this woman?

304
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,009
Yes.

305
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,113
How's work these days?

306
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:08,007
Same as always.

307
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,588
What you said the other
day about Pyongyang..

308
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:18,622
Do you want to go home?

309
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,663
Let's not talk about that.

310
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,874
I believe we can live
with our heads held high

311
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,970
even if we are poor.

312
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:52,248
Our facial recognition analysis found
three men showing over 85% match.

313
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:54,651
These two have plenty sources
for lD verification.

314
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,527
Bring up the travel agent.

315
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,462
But there is hardly any record
nor pictures of this man.

316
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,896
I only found one taken at a
culture promotion event.

317
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,227
Gotcha.

318
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:12,708
Ouch! Damn it.

319
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,678
Hey! Interested
in something hot?

320
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:19,679
What?

321
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:23,082
A North Korean official stationed
in Berlin just filed for defection.

322
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:24,287
To America?

323
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:27,655
No, he's asking for political asylum
through the UN to some third country.

324
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:30,186
When's next contact?

325
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:07,792
What brings you to
call me at this hour?

326
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,889
I have to drop by the embassy.

327
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:12,627
Did you have lunch?

328
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:14,761
I'm on my way to the
Parliament library.

329
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,171
I can't have lunch with you.

330
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:19,739
I'll see you at home, then.

331
00:34:22,046 --> 00:34:23,446
Moran Peak 4639

332
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,938
requesting Comrade Ryun's
signing out record.

333
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:39,695
The next station is
Brandenburger Tor.

334
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,395
Negative.

335
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,801
Is the Parliament library
close to Brandenburger Tor?

336
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:47,896
It's at the Bundestag station.
Next to the Parliament building.

337
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,799
What's in Brandenburger
Tor area?

338
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,908
Embassies.

339
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,774
US and British embassies
are in the area.

340
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,512
This is a confidential
communication.

341
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:57,980
I'll report it myself.

342
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:11,352
Are you going out? You
didn't say anything to me.

343
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,117
US embassy

344
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,501
When is the next..

345
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:20,049
When is the next contact?

346
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:25,412
When is the next..

347
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:28,514
When is the next contact?

348
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,550
Long time, Comrade.

349
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:58,614
Still have two more days.

350
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:03,220
Did you put a tail on her?

351
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:09,197
I'm not here about your wife.

352
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,697
How can a perfectionist
like you.

353
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,502
Let this happen under your nose?

354
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,837
Something doesn't add up.

355
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:30,644
Is that an official statement?

356
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:37,126
We'll know soon enough.

357
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,722
I'm not accusing
you of anything.

358
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:43,257
The guilty will stand
for their crime.

359
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,902
Why are you really here?

360
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:59,315
It's a sticky situation.

361
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:05,121
And it's a matter
outside my authority.

362
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:12,152
One happy family.

363
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:21,704
There is a reactionary
seeking political asylum.

364
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:29,036
Someone from the embassy.

365
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:39,555
It's Comrade Ambassador.

366
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:47,256
Comrade Lee emptied out
the embassy's strong box.

367
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,025
This device will self
destruct after checking

368
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,297
Your password will be verbally
confirmed upon point of contact.

369
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:00,006
The agent key-phrase is,

370
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:02,541
It looks like it's
going to rain.

371
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:05,540
Your answer, verbatim, is,

372
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:07,980
But I've lost my
folding umbrella.

373
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:28,971
Your password will be verbally
confirmed upon point of contact.

374
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:32,408
The agent key-phrase is, it
looks like it's going to rain.

375
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,806
Your answer, verbatim,
is, But I've lost..

376
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:37,806
This is the time and
venue of rendezvous.

377
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:57,931
What's taking you so long?

378
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:00,469
What? What's taking so long?

379
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,064
You're the one that wanted some
private time with the guy.

380
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:05,370
We're gonna head to the U.S.
Embassy,

381
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:07,242
And enter the safe-house.

382
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:10,112
- You mean the laundromat?
- Excuse me. Do you speak English?

383
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:10,807
No.

384
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:18,745
We've got about the three hours
until the official time of contact,

385
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:23,218
so, factorin' in travel, I
can spare you about an hour.

386
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:28,864
We can say you work for the company
and that you're interrogating him.

387
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,824
That's as far as you
and I take this.

388
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:34,733
After that, it's every
old dog for himself.

389
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:37,773
And regardless of
what happens here,

390
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:42,108
the CIA has no affiliation
whatsoever with this operation.

391
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:45,640
There should be absolutely
no records, do you here me?

392
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:47,515
What's he offering you?

393
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:48,984
We're not sure yet,

394
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,185
But he mentioned a file,

395
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:52,488
some kind of shady account
they've been managing.

396
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,623
The Kim Jong-il account?
From Macau?

397
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,489
Oh sweet Jesus.

398
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:59,218
I wouldn't that make
everyone's fuckin' day?

399
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:02,329
You owe me pal big time.

400
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,595
3737 G406.

401
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,338
11 o'clock Target's
location confirmed.

402
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,001
Don't stand out
Blend in, idiots!

403
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:24,720
Did you tap my phone?

404
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:28,555
You're out of your mind to
interfere with CIA business.

405
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:31,224
How is North Korean
ambassador a CIA business?

406
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:32,556
It's ours.

407
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:35,591
Stand back if anything happens.

408
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,333
I'll take over.

409
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,460
Hey!

410
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:39,568
Hey!

411
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:40,866
You, son of a..!

412
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,662
Target is getting away He's
heading to the subway.

413
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:45,900
Team A follow the subject.
Team B go across.

414
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:47,201
We gotta snatch the bastard
before anybody else.

415
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:43,189
Jong-seong.

416
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:46,026
Think about what you're doing.

417
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:47,760
We'll talk later.

418
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:51,791
Freeze!

419
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:53,959
Put the gun down.

420
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:55,636
This is our turf.

421
00:45:55,872 --> 00:45:57,203
You don't want any
more trouble..

422
00:46:54,998 --> 00:46:56,625
Motherfucker!

423
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:00,901
Take it easy, man.

424
00:47:05,074 --> 00:47:07,269
Listen to me carefully now.

425
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:10,707
Go back to the headquarter.

426
00:47:12,115 --> 00:47:14,550
Find everything you can on
the CIA agents out here.

427
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,247
- But it's CIA..
- Shut the hell up.

428
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:20,355
Another word from your mouth

429
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:25,157
and I'll chew your brain out.

430
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:02,588
Hi, Daddy. I love you.

431
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,433
Good bye.

432
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,526
No.

433
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,904
Come on, Cindy.

434
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:33,896
You knew my team was tracking
Asim and his network!

435
00:48:33,897 --> 00:48:36,024
Way to bend me over
the barrel, pal!

436
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:41,732
Send me the address
of the travel agency.

437
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,039
Why did you do it?

438
00:48:47,277 --> 00:48:51,714
I want you to think hard
why Dong Myung-su is here

439
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,349
why your wife is
being suspected.

440
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:58,654
You were planning to abandon your
family and defect to the West.

441
00:48:58,655 --> 00:48:59,988
This is all part of a scheme

442
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,516
set by Dong Myung-su.. No,
his father Dong Jung-ho

443
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:05,226
to take over the Berlin office.

444
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:10,492
Dong's father wasn't an
ally with the new leader

445
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,068
and yet, he survived. How?

446
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,630
When Kim Jong-un's men pocketed
profit from illegal weapons trade.

447
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:21,200
The deal was handled
by Dong Jung-ho.

448
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:26,144
When the Americans tracked
down the Macau account.

449
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:30,183
Dongs had to clean up the mess
in order to stay in the game.

450
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:35,548
What did you get her to do?

451
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:39,995
But you don't believe
anything I say.

452
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:42,658
Questioning is in progress.
You can go in.

453
00:49:42,765 --> 00:49:44,198
Jong-seong,

454
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:48,264
when you're blocked by the sea,
sing 'Arirang' a semitone down

455
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:50,931
and 'whistle' the chorus.

456
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,582
The Party wants to see
and hear for themselves.

457
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:22,902
Tell me what you want to hear.

458
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:24,967
I'll give an answer you want

459
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:30,802
in return for a quick death.

460
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:35,912
Your family is never your
concern even to the end.

461
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:40,352
There is nothing I
can do about them.

462
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:50,689
He talks as if
he's being framed.

463
00:51:40,983 --> 00:51:42,780
Your name and position.

464
00:51:45,154 --> 00:51:46,951
Lee Hak-su.

465
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:52,087
I'm an ambassador of Democratic
People's Republic of Korea

466
00:51:54,764 --> 00:51:57,665
to Germany.

467
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:01,392
Why did you betray your country?

468
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:08,076
I just sent you the address
of the travel agency.

469
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:12,277
Frequent address changes
suggest it's a front company.

470
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:16,018
Shouldn't we notify Chief Kang?

471
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,815
I'll take care of it.

472
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:24,483
Hello.

473
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:28,592
There is a break-in
in my building.

474
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:33,268
The address is Einstenufer 9D.

475
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:35,328
It's the travel agency building.

476
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:13,303
What happened here?

477
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:14,906
Why did you lie to me

478
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:19,804
about where you were
going this afternoon?

479
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:21,446
Do you have anything
to say to me?

480
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:23,484
You knew about it all?

481
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:29,351
You weren't going to say
anything if I didn't?

482
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:31,823
I don't know where to begin.

483
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:34,454
I suppose I missed
the right time.

484
00:53:34,697 --> 00:53:36,392
Tell me how it started.

485
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:39,032
It was an order from
Comrade Ambassador.

486
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:41,402
Not out of my will.

487
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:43,638
You're not giving me an answer.

488
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:46,041
Perhaps I don't
know what you want.

489
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,306
What have you been up to?

490
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:50,569
What am I supposed to do?

491
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:53,138
Entertaining guest was an order.

492
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:01,079
But I assure you.

493
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:08,995
This baby is ours.

494
00:54:13,936 --> 00:54:18,930
This man was asking me about
an event at the square.

495
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:22,708
And this is where
my obstetrician is.

496
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:28,811
Why didn't you tell me?

497
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:34,346
I thought you wouldn't
believe it's ours.

498
00:54:35,224 --> 00:54:36,953
What I think is not important.

499
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:38,253
Tell me the truth.

500
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,430
This is the truth.

501
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:09,986
Why didn't you say
anything earlier?

502
00:55:11,427 --> 00:55:13,827
Did you ever listen?

503
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:23,263
Do you know what it's like to
endure this kind of filth?

504
00:55:28,244 --> 00:55:29,541
Our first child

505
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:36,312
It's been two years
since we lost her

506
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:41,989
How much the little thing
must have suffered..

507
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:48,588
Have you ever
thought about that?

508
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:53,134
So what?

509
00:55:53,636 --> 00:55:55,536
Were you going to
have an abortion?

510
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,567
How can you say such a thing?

511
00:56:01,877 --> 00:56:04,679
We'll go to the hospital tomorrow.
If it turns out to be false..

512
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,843
You'll report me as a spy?

513
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:12,449
That will give you
a peace of mind.

514
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,058
That's what the Party
wants to hear.

515
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:19,255
Today,

516
00:56:19,595 --> 00:56:22,393
Comrade Ambassador made an
attempt to defect to the West.

517
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:29,803
Write down all your whereabouts
in the last seven days.

518
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:39,042
Did you get her confession?

519
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:41,783
We still have time.

520
00:56:43,886 --> 00:56:46,684
I must have interrupted
at an inconvenient time.

521
00:56:48,257 --> 00:56:49,918
How did the interrogation go?

522
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:52,184
Successful, thanks to you.

523
00:56:53,796 --> 00:56:56,822
His body will be
repatriated to Pyongyang.

524
00:56:57,967 --> 00:56:59,594
Good work, Comrade.

525
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,631
I haven't found any evidence
tying Jung-hee to her charges.

526
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,499
Relax, man.

527
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:12,941
Congratulations.

528
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,014
You have passed
the loyalty test.

529
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:22,148
All this was necessary
because of Lee Hak-su.

530
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:25,484
After Comrade Chairman
Kim Jong-il passed away,

531
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:29,621
foreign funds coming into
Pyongyang dropped considerably.

532
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:35,701
While all focus was on ensuring
successful transition of power,

533
00:57:36,372 --> 00:57:38,573
there was a suspicion
that Lee Hak-su

534
00:57:38,574 --> 00:57:42,066
would smuggle his private
assets and defect.

535
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:47,310
And your name popped
up in the process.

536
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,151
A group of us including
myself insisted

537
00:57:50,152 --> 00:57:52,985
that you would never
betray the Republic.

538
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:56,924
The Party's position, of
course, is not the same.

539
00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:00,092
So, I suggested that
we test your loyalty.

540
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:07,735
How can we suspect the loyalty of a
man who will report his own wife

541
00:58:07,736 --> 00:58:09,897
if there are suspicious
circumstances?

542
00:58:11,373 --> 00:58:15,935
Agents from Security Department
will pay you a visit shortly.

543
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:19,944
You'll return to Pyongyang
and be promoted

544
00:58:20,449 --> 00:58:23,077
in recognition of your loyalty.

545
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:24,951
Congratulations, Comrade.

546
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:26,952
You have saved me also.

547
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:35,361
How much did you hear?

548
00:58:36,732 --> 00:58:38,825
You're a coward.

549
00:58:47,643 --> 00:58:49,201
What the hell are you doing?

550
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:52,146
Once they find out what
you're doing to me,

551
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:53,876
you're a fucking dead man.

552
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:57,247
What do you think
will happen to you?

553
00:58:57,987 --> 00:58:59,045
Today

554
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:03,784
a North Korean fucking commie blew
a hole through my friend's head.

555
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,693
At Brandenburg Gate?

556
00:59:05,928 --> 00:59:09,420
My friend was CIA
tracking Asim's group.

557
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:14,068
If I report your lD

558
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:17,368
and tell them that
Israel is working with

559
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:20,605
the North Koreans who took Asim,

560
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:29,880
your fucking face will be on every CIA
watch-list in the world within 48 hours.

561
00:59:32,054 --> 00:59:33,316
What now?

562
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:37,414
Do you want a cool diplomatic
dispute with America over this?

563
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:53,265
About a month ago,

564
00:59:53,876 --> 00:59:56,902
Pyongyang contacted
Mossad Collections.

565
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,510
I'm not here about your wife

566
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:10,592
How can a perfectionist like you
let this happen under your nose?

567
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:13,619
The guilty will stand
for their crime.

568
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:19,224
They told us that if we
gave them the opportunity

569
01:00:19,568 --> 01:00:22,503
to replace a few of their
people in Berlin..

570
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:26,768
Then they'd hand over the man
they do business with. Asim.

571
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:30,036
The weapons deal had to fail.

572
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:34,244
It was the opportunity
they needed.

573
01:00:37,419 --> 01:00:40,121
Did someone on the
inside betray the North?

574
01:00:40,122 --> 01:00:42,181
I only know what I need to know,

575
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,292
but.. I think

576
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:48,024
the North Korean agent at the
scene was double-crossed.

577
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:55,836
There is a sudden noise in the house.
Be careful.

578
01:01:15,491 --> 01:01:18,983
Wiretapping

579
01:01:19,128 --> 01:01:22,154
You have the phone
records from that time?

580
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:24,264
You want those?

581
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,461
I never mentioned
about reporting you

582
01:01:29,772 --> 01:01:33,868
I have recorded everything
you've said here.

583
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:37,040
The word came out of your mouth

584
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:41,576
How can I have passed the test?

585
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:45,151
It's a trap We must run

586
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:48,251
Do you want it deleted?

587
01:01:48,557 --> 01:01:52,926
Then you're gonna give me your
conversation with the fucking commie.

588
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:04,468
Did you finish packing?

589
01:02:14,717 --> 01:02:16,708
We'll make some record
for reporting purposes.

590
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:25,517
Looking for this?

591
01:02:33,602 --> 01:02:38,471
Idiots.. I warned
you to be careful.

592
01:02:39,274 --> 01:02:40,901
Didn't I?

593
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,373
Allo..

594
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:48,281
Abdul!

595
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:57,415
Allo.

596
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,525
Sorry I'm late.

597
01:02:59,661 --> 01:03:02,596
So.. what happened
to your brother?

598
01:03:02,965 --> 01:03:05,832
The Mossad executed
him without trial.

599
01:03:07,703 --> 01:03:11,833
I found the rat who gave your
brother Asim over to the Israelis..

600
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,875
If you get on it now, you
can still catch him.

601
01:03:15,911 --> 01:03:17,310
Who is it?

602
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:19,343
It's someone we both know.

603
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:23,550
Pyo Jong-seong.

604
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:44,565
Take this.

605
01:08:23,118 --> 01:08:25,453
A shooting incident was just
reported to the police.

606
01:08:25,454 --> 01:08:28,855
A North Korean interpreter
lives at the address.

607
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:30,550
Hey.

608
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:35,029
Can you tap CIA satellite
communication network?

609
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,799
Put a surveillance on all
channels within 20km radius.

610
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,165
Are you out of your mind?

611
01:08:40,368 --> 01:08:43,531
Just do as I say for once.

612
01:08:43,672 --> 01:08:45,435
Tapping is your
expertise, isn't it?

613
01:08:51,313 --> 01:08:52,439
See you again.

614
01:08:52,547 --> 01:08:53,741
Watch your back.

615
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:58,052
You're going to run into
the Mossad again one day,

616
01:08:58,053 --> 01:08:59,281
and it won't be pretty.

617
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:02,049
Man, you talk too much.

618
01:09:11,032 --> 01:09:12,329
Do you have a room?

619
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:26,046
I prefer not to fill
out the register.

620
01:09:40,996 --> 01:09:42,156
Are you alright?

621
01:09:47,502 --> 01:09:49,129
We should treat
your wounds first.

622
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:00,808
Hey, policeman.

623
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:02,242
I'm from the consulate.

624
01:11:03,278 --> 01:11:05,439
Here to lD the victim. OK?

625
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:07,448
Can you speak English?

626
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:08,582
- Nein.
- No?

627
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,651
We got a call from
a Korean student..

628
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:13,314
No problem. Just a moment.

629
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,194
An Asian from the
consulate is here.

630
01:11:20,562 --> 01:11:24,865
A single precision shot
each to the head and chest.

631
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:26,663
These bastards are
not circumcised

632
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:29,292
and their dental work suggests
they're North Koreans.

633
01:11:29,904 --> 01:11:32,304
I gotta get moving.

634
01:11:34,442 --> 01:11:36,808
- Hey! Halt?
- Hi. I'll be right back.

635
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:42,539
Idiots.

636
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,580
Alright.

637
01:11:53,061 --> 01:11:56,292
He killed all of our
comrades and escaped.

638
01:11:56,798 --> 01:11:57,965
He's good, huh?

639
01:11:57,966 --> 01:11:59,024
We'll get him.

640
01:11:59,134 --> 01:12:01,602
Okay. First,

641
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:05,235
have your men search every
hotel within ten kilometers.

642
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,341
Their names will
not be on record.

643
01:12:07,342 --> 01:12:12,006
So look for a couple who paid in cash
and checked-in in the last 10 minutes.

644
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,107
How certain are you of this?

645
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:16,046
It's what he taught me.

646
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:21,150
If you're being hunted, hide
right under the hound's nose.

647
01:12:32,901 --> 01:12:33,890
Allo.

648
01:12:38,073 --> 01:12:39,473
Hey. Allo.

649
01:12:39,474 --> 01:12:42,204
This is a direct
order from the boss.

650
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,807
Search every hotel
within 10Km radius.

651
01:12:46,581 --> 01:12:48,048
Look for a man and a woman

652
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:53,018
who paid cash and didn't
fill out the register.

653
01:12:53,421 --> 01:12:56,618
I'm sending you their picture.

654
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,416
Sir, the keywords 'North
Korea, ' 'Abdul, '

655
01:13:00,429 --> 01:13:01,695
and 'Assim' emerged on
CIA satellite network.

656
01:13:01,696 --> 01:13:03,530
- Language used is Arabic.
- Arabic? What's the location?

657
01:13:03,531 --> 01:13:06,056
It's concentrated in the 10Km
radius of the shooting scene.

658
01:13:09,404 --> 01:13:10,894
Give us the traitor.

659
01:13:11,339 --> 01:13:12,704
I'd like to,

660
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:17,010
but I need to get
them back as a set.

661
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,478
Hey, listen man.

662
01:13:20,448 --> 01:13:23,042
If I become the
director of Berlin.

663
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:24,618
Then we can cut out the broker.

664
01:13:24,619 --> 01:13:26,849
Everything will be
cheaper and faster.

665
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:30,081
We can pack up some super-notes
for you if you want.

666
01:13:30,225 --> 01:13:33,217
Because no one better
dollars than we do.

667
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:38,259
But that's only after you drag out
this bastard's corpse, isn't' it?

668
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,992
Trust me.

669
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:44,729
Where are you?

670
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,307
It's a couple?

671
01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:05,322
Jong-seong,

672
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,862
when you're blocked by the sea,
sing Arirang a semitone down

673
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:11,755
and whistle the chorus.

674
01:14:12,834 --> 01:14:14,701
There was a suspicion
that Lee Hak-su

675
01:14:14,702 --> 01:14:18,035
Arirang would smuggle his
private assets and defect.

676
01:14:18,339 --> 01:14:22,242
When Kim Jong-un's men pocketed
profit from illegal weapons trade.

677
01:14:22,243 --> 01:14:24,108
The deal was handled
by Dong Jung-ho.

678
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:29,016
And your name popped
up in the process.

679
01:14:29,284 --> 01:14:33,414
The Whistle When the Americans
tracked down the Macau account.

680
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:37,148
Dongs had to clean up the mess
in order to stay in the game.

681
01:14:37,325 --> 01:14:41,028
How can we suspect the loyalty of a
man who will report his own wife

682
01:14:41,029 --> 01:14:43,190
if there are suspicious
circumstances?

683
01:14:44,766 --> 01:14:46,393
I want you to think hard

684
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:48,735
why Dong Myung-su came here

685
01:14:48,937 --> 01:14:51,064
and why your wife is
suspected of spying.

686
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:54,641
Listen to me carefully.

687
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,241
Dong Myung-su

688
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,644
is setting me up to make it appear
that I sold classified information.

689
01:15:04,018 --> 01:15:06,714
He is trying to turn me and
Lee Hak-su into traitors

690
01:15:06,888 --> 01:15:11,450
and take over the Berlin office.

691
01:15:22,403 --> 01:15:25,065
If that's true, what
are we doing here?

692
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:28,175
Can we ever go
back to Pyongyang?

693
01:15:29,844 --> 01:15:31,368
We'll go separate
ways from here.

694
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,271
Where will you go?

695
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,813
I can prove our innocence to the Party.
You must trust me.

696
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:41,118
The Party, the people, even the
fatherland can all suspect me.

697
01:15:42,023 --> 01:15:43,650
But you..

698
01:15:45,827 --> 01:15:47,818
you should have believed in me.

699
01:15:48,796 --> 01:15:50,320
Will you defect or something?

700
01:16:00,141 --> 01:16:02,974
How can you be so cruel?

701
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:14,819
Kill me whenever you want.

702
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:16,487
But now is not the time.

703
01:16:57,899 --> 01:16:59,799
We're not here to kill you.

704
01:17:00,835 --> 01:17:03,633
But if you continue to
resist, we have no choice.

705
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:06,600
You have ten seconds to decide.

706
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:08,499
One.

707
01:17:08,876 --> 01:17:10,002
Two.

708
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:10,936
Three.

709
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,005
We're getting out
alive, all three of us.

710
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,510
Seven.

711
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:17,985
Eight.

712
01:17:17,986 --> 01:17:19,385
That's all you
gotta think about.

713
01:17:20,188 --> 01:17:21,177
Ten!

714
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:14,669
Hey!

715
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:48,478
You only got the woman?

716
01:21:53,427 --> 01:21:56,596
You said there would be only two!
You gave us incorrect information!

717
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:58,292
There was another man there.

718
01:21:58,432 --> 01:22:01,401
What? Another guy? A Yankee?

719
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:03,332
They said he looked like you.

720
01:22:06,774 --> 01:22:08,639
It's a South Korean.

721
01:22:11,145 --> 01:22:13,739
Welcome South Korean guy.

722
01:22:13,881 --> 01:22:17,681
You've really gone too far.
This is getting interesting.

723
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:41,274
Let me get this straight.
My team breaks up

724
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:43,877
the arms deal Yuri set for Asim

725
01:22:43,878 --> 01:22:46,745
and you'll hand both
of them over to us?

726
01:22:46,847 --> 01:22:48,439
I don't believe you.

727
01:22:53,187 --> 01:22:56,679
Take the wheel, if you
want to hear the rest.

728
01:23:18,713 --> 01:23:20,476
It's been so long.

729
01:23:28,856 --> 01:23:31,450
This is why I like you so much.

730
01:23:40,101 --> 01:23:43,502
Why do you think the Mossad
let you go at the hotel?

731
01:23:46,073 --> 01:23:47,700
From Macau to Berlin,

732
01:23:47,808 --> 01:23:51,335
arms dealing, diplomatic office,
spying, assassination and defection.

733
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,910
How do they all link up?

734
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,686
The account that Lee Hak-su
held as a hidden card,

735
01:23:59,787 --> 01:24:03,553
the 4 billion dollar fund that Kim
Jong-il left behind is the key.

736
01:24:04,091 --> 01:24:05,718
After his death,

737
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,894
they had to transfer the
funds to the new leader

738
01:24:07,895 --> 01:24:09,726
and change the people
that manage the account.

739
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:12,560
Neither Pyongyang nor Lee
Hak-su could trust each other.

740
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,233
As far as Pyongyang
is concerned,

741
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:18,338
the diplomatic offices' loyalty to
the new leader is questionable.

742
01:24:18,339 --> 01:24:21,808
So, they decided to change
everyone with those they trust.

743
01:24:21,809 --> 01:24:25,643
You've been discarded
in the process.

744
01:24:27,214 --> 01:24:28,943
You're totally fucked.

745
01:24:30,484 --> 01:24:31,917
You're wrong.

746
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,218
It's not the Republic
that betrayed me.

747
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:40,017
Do we use different Korean in
North and South these days?

748
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:42,795
You need to get the
facts straight.

749
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:44,859
This is all Dong Jung-ho's act.

750
01:24:46,967 --> 01:24:48,161
Who?

751
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:51,695
The father of the assassin
that killed your CIA friend.

752
01:24:53,007 --> 01:24:55,275
The secret account belongs to
Dong Jung-ho and his allies,

753
01:24:55,276 --> 01:24:57,210
not to Comrade
Chairman Kim Jong-il.

754
01:24:57,945 --> 01:25:01,210
Lee Hak-su was part of that
circle and got betrayed.

755
01:25:04,819 --> 01:25:06,787
Where the hell is that bastard?

756
01:25:07,088 --> 01:25:10,023
Think about who you
saw at the hotel.

757
01:25:11,325 --> 01:25:13,953
Your husband has
crossed over to South.

758
01:25:14,228 --> 01:25:15,661
It's over.

759
01:25:16,263 --> 01:25:20,666
You can't be waiting for the scumbag who
abandoned his wife to save himself?

760
01:25:23,571 --> 01:25:24,936
Think about it.

761
01:25:27,174 --> 01:25:30,166
Testify on your husband's
double-crossing charges.

762
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:32,602
I'll take care of the rest.

763
01:25:32,746 --> 01:25:36,773
Do you expect to live after
what you have done to us?

764
01:25:38,886 --> 01:25:40,615
Who would know about it?

765
01:25:46,961 --> 01:25:48,519
Who knows about this place?

766
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:50,392
The person who used to use it.

767
01:25:50,998 --> 01:25:52,056
It's me.

768
01:25:52,266 --> 01:25:55,861
All the sausages you ate
must have slowed you down.

769
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,301
What took you so long?

770
01:25:57,538 --> 01:26:00,837
How are the South
Koreans treating you?

771
01:26:01,075 --> 01:26:02,440
Let my wife go.

772
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:05,843
Wouldn't I need a witness
for a testimony?

773
01:26:06,313 --> 01:26:10,079
After all, isn't it true that you're
collaborating with the South Koreans?

774
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,151
Put her on the phone.

775
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:37,967
Are you safe?

776
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:43,116
I'm fine.

777
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:47,280
Be strong and hang in there.

778
01:26:48,122 --> 01:26:51,523
For now, do as
Myung-su tells you.

779
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:55,822
I'll come and get you soon.

780
01:27:17,785 --> 01:27:20,379
What use is giving
her a false hope?

781
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:23,453
Watch it if you
want a clean death.

782
01:27:25,826 --> 01:27:28,628
I'll die when I feel like it.

783
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:31,826
So, cut the crap and get
your ass over here now.

784
01:27:41,976 --> 01:27:44,206
If you let me go, I'll
get you the account.

785
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:50,378
Pyo Jong-seong, do you
take me for a fool?

786
01:27:54,688 --> 01:27:56,315
If I don't go,

787
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,453
you'll never find that account.

788
01:27:58,993 --> 01:28:01,461
Nor can you find your wife.

789
01:28:06,567 --> 01:28:08,899
An innocent woman will die.

790
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:12,005
Everyone dies.

791
01:28:12,006 --> 01:28:13,564
She's carrying a baby.

792
01:28:14,475 --> 01:28:16,238
It's not mine.

793
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,512
I'll convert.

794
01:28:55,649 --> 01:28:59,710
Request for backup denied The
company denies all involvement

795
01:29:05,759 --> 01:29:07,920
The backup's going
to be a little late.

796
01:29:09,963 --> 01:29:13,694
Too many people can put the
safety of the hostage at risk.

797
01:29:14,468 --> 01:29:18,165
I can do this alone
if you have my back.

798
01:29:19,373 --> 01:29:21,000
If we get her out,

799
01:29:21,842 --> 01:29:24,310
will she cross over with you?

800
01:29:28,115 --> 01:29:31,141
She may refuse.

801
01:29:31,885 --> 01:29:35,116
Let's just be honest
while we're at it.

802
01:29:35,622 --> 01:29:40,753
You're willing to risk your life
for your wife who may not convert?

803
01:29:40,894 --> 01:29:44,489
How am I supposed
to understand that?

804
01:29:46,734 --> 01:29:51,296
It's harder for me to understand why
you're risking your life for this.

805
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,532
It's my job.

806
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:57,969
There is no reason for doing your job.
You just do it.

807
01:30:02,683 --> 01:30:04,048
It's my wife.

808
01:30:04,852 --> 01:30:07,878
There is no reason
for saving my wife.

809
01:30:57,337 --> 01:30:58,895
Is he really coming?

810
01:31:00,007 --> 01:31:01,907
It's going to be a while.

811
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,943
He won't be here till after 4AM.

812
01:31:06,246 --> 01:31:08,373
Standard KGB attack time.

813
01:31:08,515 --> 01:31:10,415
When humans are weakest.

814
01:31:13,086 --> 01:31:14,280
Like that.

815
01:31:20,961 --> 01:31:23,429
The sun will come up soon.

816
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,852
Have you had a sniper training?

817
01:31:55,562 --> 01:31:59,589
I used to get reward vacations
for outstanding shooting skills.

818
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:40,038
Secure position.

819
01:32:40,474 --> 01:32:41,566
Be careful.

820
01:32:54,187 --> 01:32:55,415
On the perimeter,

821
01:32:55,656 --> 01:32:57,089
two North Koreans and two Arabs.

822
01:32:57,391 --> 01:33:00,019
Two Arabs by the center table.

823
01:33:00,727 --> 01:33:03,629
One North Korean by the
window at 3 o'clock.

824
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:04,722
Hostage is..

825
01:33:06,133 --> 01:33:08,795
on far left corner
tied to a chair.

826
01:33:09,369 --> 01:33:11,337
She seems to be in..

827
01:33:13,173 --> 01:33:14,401
good condition.

828
01:33:33,393 --> 01:33:34,360
Hey!

829
01:33:34,461 --> 01:33:36,122
Shake your head if
you can hear me.

830
01:33:37,264 --> 01:33:38,561
Shake your head, damn it!

831
01:33:41,268 --> 01:33:42,496
Son of a bitch.

832
01:34:14,868 --> 01:34:16,995
You can't kill a man like that.

833
01:34:18,338 --> 01:34:22,240
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

834
01:34:40,227 --> 01:34:43,128
What happened to your
South Korean buddies?

835
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:47,595
I can't bring in retards
to catch an idiot.

836
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:55,374
Bring the hostage over
and check the perimeter.

837
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:09,520
She made a few attempts
to escape while waiting.

838
01:35:14,928 --> 01:35:18,091
Your family didn't
have to do this

839
01:35:18,198 --> 01:35:20,632
to take control of
the Berlin office.

840
01:35:22,936 --> 01:35:26,235
You can't have two
heads on one body.

841
01:35:26,907 --> 01:35:30,172
You can endure hunger, but
can't endure headache.

842
01:35:30,677 --> 01:35:33,202
Is that the kind
of trust you have

843
01:35:33,647 --> 01:35:35,740
between Comrade Commander
and your father?

844
01:35:38,118 --> 01:35:40,052
Comrade Commander
is a human, too.

845
01:35:40,353 --> 01:35:42,218
Men betray.

846
01:35:43,757 --> 01:35:46,658
I came here to be the
traitor you want.

847
01:35:49,763 --> 01:35:54,496
If you let us go, we'll live in
hiding for the rest of our lives.

848
01:35:56,903 --> 01:36:00,270
My confession to treason
is in that voice recorder.

849
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,975
The kind of things
you'll do to live.

850
01:36:05,846 --> 01:36:09,577
It's an honor to hear the
confession of the Republic's hero.

851
01:36:11,718 --> 01:36:15,176
Comrade Pyo betraying
the Republic.

852
01:36:15,589 --> 01:36:17,557
This is so exciting.

853
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:19,083
Let's hear it, shall we?

854
01:36:19,259 --> 01:36:20,556
Before we do that,

855
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:23,819
Let me ask you one thing.

856
01:36:25,298 --> 01:36:28,290
Did you frame my
wife knowing that

857
01:36:29,002 --> 01:36:30,993
her obstetrician was
near the US embassy?

858
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:36,336
Obstetrician?

859
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:42,745
That's right! Your wife is pregnant.
It was a lucky swing.

860
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:46,283
You're the one that
built up the story.

861
01:36:47,087 --> 01:36:50,818
Isn't it your specialty?

862
01:36:51,491 --> 01:36:53,686
Making a criminal out
of the innocent.

863
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:07,807
I, Pyo Jong-seong, a warrior of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea

864
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:10,032
is having a
self-criticism session.

865
01:37:17,517 --> 01:37:20,486
The party wants to replace
the Berlin branch.

866
01:37:20,654 --> 01:37:22,281
But right now,

867
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:26,358
replacing the current
officials isn't justified.

868
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:27,883
Motherfucker!

869
01:37:36,303 --> 01:37:37,736
Play the rest.

870
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:44,176
If we ambush the deal
Yuri is onto with Asim

871
01:37:44,177 --> 01:37:49,171
then you will have the justified reason
to replace the current officials, right?

872
01:37:49,249 --> 01:37:54,414
Right. So finally you Israelis
will have Yuri and Asim,

873
01:37:54,821 --> 01:37:56,550
Like you've been wanting.

874
01:37:57,057 --> 01:37:58,718
We can hand them over.

875
01:38:04,097 --> 01:38:06,156
Explain yourself.

876
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:11,337
Didn't I always tell you?

877
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:15,736
You always get your temper
get the best of you.

878
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,474
You think you have it all?

879
01:38:22,415 --> 01:38:24,940
Look at what you got yourself
into playing a hero.

880
01:38:27,754 --> 01:38:29,949
I admit you were a good teacher.

881
01:43:09,402 --> 01:43:10,369
Are you alright?

882
01:44:09,495 --> 01:44:11,929
You must leave me if
you wish to live.

883
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:14,026
Don't be silly.

884
01:44:16,269 --> 01:44:17,998
I know how you feel.

885
01:44:19,339 --> 01:44:22,069
Then stick it out to the end.

886
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:05,600
Are you okay?

887
01:46:05,712 --> 01:46:08,180
It's okay. I'm on your side.

888
01:46:16,022 --> 01:46:19,958
Do you think you can move?

889
01:48:48,908 --> 01:48:50,000
Go on.

890
01:48:50,343 --> 01:48:51,901
Inject me.

891
01:48:56,115 --> 01:49:00,279
You know killing me won't
put an end to this.

892
01:49:03,556 --> 01:49:07,219
I'll put in a good word
for you to my father.

893
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,490
Let's just call it
a day here, eh?

894
01:49:14,433 --> 01:49:15,661
Men betray.

895
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:41,590
What's your hometown?

896
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:01,707
It's okay.

897
01:50:02,448 --> 01:50:03,437
Let's go.

898
01:50:05,718 --> 01:50:07,049
Come on, Jung-hee.

899
01:50:10,323 --> 01:50:14,555
We still have so
much to talk about.

900
01:50:16,896 --> 01:50:18,056
Let's go now.

901
01:50:20,766 --> 01:50:22,233
We can go anywhere we want.

902
01:50:24,537 --> 01:50:25,868
I'm sorry.

903
01:50:39,251 --> 01:50:40,513
Jung-hee,

904
01:50:41,187 --> 01:50:42,518
wake up.

905
01:50:43,022 --> 01:50:44,421
Please.

906
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:46,689
Jung-hee,

907
01:50:46,993 --> 01:50:48,290
come on.

908
01:50:52,798 --> 01:50:55,426
Come with me.

909
01:53:24,617 --> 01:53:26,117
Where are we at
with the procedure?

910
01:53:26,118 --> 01:53:26,785
Application for Defection

911
01:53:26,786 --> 01:53:28,651
Application for Defection
At the last stage.

912
01:53:28,988 --> 01:53:31,422
He could convert to
our side if he wishes

913
01:53:32,191 --> 01:53:34,284
or choose a third
country through the UN.

914
01:53:35,127 --> 01:53:36,560
Good work, everyone.

915
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:39,495
Let's wrap up this
investigation here.

916
01:53:39,832 --> 01:53:42,198
All documents regarding the
account or Pyo Jong-seong

917
01:53:42,301 --> 01:53:45,103
must be destroyed living
only the minimum record

918
01:53:45,104 --> 01:53:46,435
to be classified
as class 1 secret.

919
01:53:46,505 --> 01:53:50,236
There are still a few
remaining procedures.

920
01:53:50,342 --> 01:53:53,878
The President has announced

921
01:53:53,879 --> 01:53:57,042
a new gas pipe project
during his visit to Russia.

922
01:53:57,383 --> 01:53:59,248
We concluded our
negotiations with Pyongyang.

923
01:53:59,919 --> 01:54:01,574
Their last condition was
for us to hand over

924
01:54:01,587 --> 01:54:03,252
the account and Pyo
Jong-seong to them.

925
01:54:03,856 --> 01:54:05,657
Will he be purged

926
01:54:05,658 --> 01:54:08,092
along with Dong Jung-ho?

927
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:14,096
Why would Dong be purged?

928
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,293
He is the one that
set up this deal.

929
01:54:18,571 --> 01:54:22,268
You know those types
don't go down easily.

930
01:55:04,383 --> 01:55:05,441
Get off.

931
01:55:07,353 --> 01:55:09,287
Get out of the car,
you goddamn commie!

932
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:28,206
I can't watch a commie like you

933
01:55:28,607 --> 01:55:30,802
Live a trouble-free life.

934
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:40,177
Go.

935
01:55:41,787 --> 01:55:43,584
You failed to protect your wife

936
01:55:43,822 --> 01:55:46,290
and the baby that
she was carrying.

937
01:55:46,659 --> 01:55:48,226
You even betrayed a man

938
01:55:48,227 --> 01:55:50,218
who risked his life to help you.

939
01:55:50,663 --> 01:55:52,530
You betrayed your country

940
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:54,226
and the people.

941
01:55:54,533 --> 01:55:56,125
That's who you are.

942
01:55:56,268 --> 01:55:58,259
Live in hiding all your life

943
01:55:58,570 --> 01:56:00,872
Looking over your shoulder.

944
01:56:00,873 --> 01:56:03,137
Live like that. Like a dirt.

945
01:56:03,575 --> 01:56:06,203
Don't even think about letting
your heart out to anyone.

946
01:56:06,312 --> 01:56:08,678
Don't think about revenge.

947
01:56:09,014 --> 01:56:12,211
Just lay low breathing shallow.

948
01:56:14,153 --> 01:56:15,882
Like the most common people.

949
01:56:37,042 --> 01:56:39,704
It's me. How have you been?

950
01:56:39,878 --> 01:56:43,314
Did you hope to live after
what you did to my son?

951
01:56:44,383 --> 01:56:46,647
You're not going anywhere.

952
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:49,685
It's not just us
who's after you.

953
01:56:49,788 --> 01:56:51,688
You don't have to find
me I'll come find you.

954
01:56:52,391 --> 01:56:53,756
Make it fast.

955
01:56:54,093 --> 01:56:57,756
I'll make you pant like a
dog begging me to kill you.

956
01:57:22,054 --> 01:57:23,715
Vladivostok, one way.

957
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:31,000
