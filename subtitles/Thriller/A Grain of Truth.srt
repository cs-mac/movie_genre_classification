www.titlovi.com

2
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,824
Are you asleep?

3
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,952
Has Grzegorz been told?

4
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:12,989
I thought perhaps you would...

5
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,556
I'm really sorry, Basia.

6
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,748
Excuse me, but she's my friend.

7
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,388
She was your friend.

8
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:41,071
- Where are the forensic guys?
- Wojtus will be here any moment.

9
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:43,069
Operational officer?

10
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,873
I know it's foggy and dark
and you can't see a thing.

11
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,917
But all your old pals in these houses...
and your buddies in those ones...

12
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,829
have to be questioned by noon.

13
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,277
Excuse me, but are you
conducting this case now?

14
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,393
Yeah.

15
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,116
And might I ask why?

16
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:08,157
Because it doesn't involve the theft
of a cell phone at a junior school?

17
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,789
I'm going straight to Misia.

18
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,958
Is somebody coming from C.I.D.?
Do they star work at ten?

19
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:18,234
I'm right here, son.

20
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:30,437
Teodor Szacki.

21
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,669
Wilczur, Leon.

22
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,389
Have you ever lived
outside Warsaw before?

23
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,834
Not until now.

24
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,036
So you know fuck all about life.

25
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,589
But it's not a sin.
I'll help you.

26
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,190
All you have to do is carry
out the instructions

27
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,271
of the prosecutor
in charge of the case.

28
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:57,235
I'd like to know who butchered
that clown Budnik's wife.

29
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,550
Instinct tells me
you're going to find out.

30
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,878
But you're not from here.
They'll all talk to you,

31
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,758
but they won't tell you anything.

32
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,430
Sometimes you'll be trying to figure
out who's really with whom and why.

33
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,757
That's when I'll help you.

34
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,155
You could have lost your fingers.

35
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:30,837
You could have contaminated the murder
weapon with your blood, you cretin.

36
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,917
How do you know it's the murder weapon?

37
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm conjecturing.

38
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:41,436
As we've found a woman with her throat
slashed under one bush, and this...

39
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,559
razor-machete under another,

40
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:46,760
there might be a connection,
don't you think?

41
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,798
Please try one.

42
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,835
I put a really thin layer of
plum jam under the meringue.

43
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,317
I still have some left from the fall.

44
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:59,961
All right, Basia,
tell us what this is about.

45
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:04,034
I'd like to understand why.

46
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:08,200
I've been conducting my own inquiries for
seven years at our prosecution service,

47
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,518
and now I'm being
taken off Ela's murder.

48
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:14,037
I'd like to know why
Mr Szacki is going to run it,

49
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:17,479
who doesn't know the town
and its special features.

50
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,795
And I'd like to say that

51
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:24,278
I was sorry to find out
about it this way.

52
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,121
You might at least
have warned me, Misia.

53
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:30,201
I know, Basia, I'm sorry.

54
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:33,316
Normally a case like this one
would have been for you.

55
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,322
But this isn't a normal situation.

56
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,795
Ela was a close friend of yours,

57
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,920
and you were connected
with Grzegorz too.

58
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,317
The defense could use that against us.

59
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:46,323
Besides, emotions aren't much
help in a homicide investigation.

60
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:48,916
Fuck all you know about my emotions.

61
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:50,964
It's blissful ignorance.

62
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,115
You can snipe
at each other later, my dears.

63
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,804
Now I'm going to explain
your professional position.

64
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:56,556
I hope...

65
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:00,195
Prosecutor Szacki will run the inquiry.

66
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:04,597
Because I want to avoid a situation where the
victim, the suspects and the investigator

67
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:08,798
are a crowd of old friends who only the
other day were chatting over the barbecue.

68
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,925
But as Mr Szacki is new here,

69
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,836
you're going to give him
advice about everything

70
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:17,878
to do with the town
and its residents.

71
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,156
Welcome to all you aficionados
of cold steel,

72
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,994
fans of slashing, devotees of slicing,
stab wound enthusiasts...

73
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:28,714
<i>In this edition of Thrust! video-magazine</i>

74
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,041
I've got a really sharp rarity for you:

75
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:35,240
we're gonna meet a writer who
hand-crafts his own Samurai swords!

76
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,444
There's also no lack of curios,
like this whip, which might seem exotic,

77
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:41,361
but these have been braided
in Poland since ancient times.

78
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,961
And the moving story of
the Kriegsmarine dagger

79
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,204
that saved the honor of one
Mazurian peasant girl.

80
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,482
As I always say,

81
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:52,203
show me your knife,
and I'll tell you who you are!

82
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,036
You've caused enough trouble already.
Please leave!

83
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,199
Do you think I want to be here?

84
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:29,081
The prosecutor told me to come.

85
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,001
The body wasn't on our grounds.

86
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:33,080
I don't want any fuss here.

87
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:35,519
So do you want the archive
surrounded by police tape,

88
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,748
a search warrant
and twelve forensic expers

89
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,928
who'll spend a week looking for
trace evidence?

90
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:45,920
So if I've got it right,

91
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,279
people hire you to travel
round the boondocks

92
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,524
looking for documents about
their ancestors, is that so?

93
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:51,639
Yes.

94
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,279
And they pay for that?

95
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,560
As long as the ancestors
are the right ones.

96
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,247
- The right ones?
- Meaning, no illiterate peasants,

97
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,683
not to mention Jews.

98
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,801
They want aristocrats-some of them
will be happy with decent bourgeoisie,

99
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,801
but that's rare.
There has to be a coat of arms.

100
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,603
- And do you always find one?
- Yes.

101
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,799
But round here they're all
descended from peasants, surely.

102
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,761
Give me a name
and the records will turn up.

103
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,844
Once you star digging around in history,
you can soon find just about anything in there.

104
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,320
Sometimes it's the truth.
Sometimes it's the shocking truth.

105
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,801
And sometimes it's the slightly
stretched truth. Look, it's here.

106
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,320
Did anything happen before
you saw the corpse?

107
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:25,445
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

108
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,366
And I have no idea
who could have done it.

109
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,569
I'd say nobody from round here,

110
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,565
if not for the fact that it must
have been someone from round here.

111
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:42,730
I don't believe in the idea of a wandering
stranger putting himself to so much trouble.

112
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,369
There's one thing you have to understand...

113
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,765
Nobody here likes Budnik.

114
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:53,572
You know the
loud-mouthed do-gooder type

115
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:56,412
who's always in the middle
of some great crusade?

116
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,043
He's that type.

117
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:02,805
Never mind if he's right or not,
he's always bloody infuriating.

118
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,848
What about her?

119
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,086
Mother Elzbieta of the Angels,

120
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:10,934
that's what they called her.

121
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,414
A madwoman?

122
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:14,605
The total opposite.

123
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,454
Goodness personified.

124
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:19,089
This is Poland-she must have
been hated for something.

125
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:20,528
No, she wasn't.

126
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:24,767
Have you questioned him?

127
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:28,451
I asked him a few technical questions,
but I'm leaving the rest to you.

128
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,175
Where was he yesterday?

129
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:31,804
At home.

130
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:34,455
- What about her?
- She was at home too.

131
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,044
- I'm sorry?
- So he says.

132
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,047
They watched T,

133
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,809
snuggled up

134
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,694
and went to sleep.

135
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:47,731
When he got up in the morning
she wasn't there.

136
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,092
That's crap!

137
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,571
The dumbest lies I've ever
heard in my entire career.

138
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:56,766
Yeah...

139
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:05,608
"OPEN"

140
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,257
Was there any gas?

141
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:40,616
<i>- Hi, it's me.
- Hi, I can see that.</i>

142
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:41,727
<i>What do you want?</i>

143
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,336
I'm just calling.

144
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:46,093
How are you doing?
How's Helka?

145
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,690
<i>She's fine, I'm hassling her to do her
homework, she's got a test tomorrow.</i>

146
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:52,338
<i>- What's the test?
- Nature.</i>

147
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,928
<i>Teo, is there something in
paricular you want? I'm quite busy.</i>

148
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:56,968
In paricular?

149
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,928
In paricular I want to know
when my daughter's coming here.

150
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,334
I get the impression you're
making it hard for her to see me.

151
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,212
<i>Don't be paranoid.
You know she doesn't like going there.</i>

152
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:07,374
Why is that?

153
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,213
Because as soon as she does, her
step-father will have some competition,

154
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,979
and your shiny new relationship
won't be quite so shiny?

155
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,899
<i>Teo...?</i>

156
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,933
Well, all right, but she's got to
understand that I live here now.

157
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,138
<i>You explain it to her.</i>

158
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,413
Maybe I'll come see you.

159
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,974
<i>Maybe.</i>

160
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,210
<i>As you wish.</i>

161
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,171
<i>Teo... please,
if there's nothing in paricular...</i>

162
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,018
No, thanks,

163
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,133
give her a kiss for me.

164
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,491
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

165
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:22,417
- I asked about one single knife.
- I know, I know all that.

166
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,256
But it's just that I've spent years trying
to get them to put me on the list of experts

167
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,254
- in cold steel...
- Cut to the chase!

168
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,296
Your "razor-machete"

169
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,463
is a chalef,

170
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:58,133
a knife used for the ritual slaughter
of animals, as used by a shochet

171
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,141
a Jewish butcher.

172
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:03,062
This is a small one, for poultry.

173
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,295
Yours, the XXL version, is for cattle.

174
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:09,183
There's also a medium-sized one,
for lambs.

175
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:12,575
- Are you cerain?
- One hundred percent.

176
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:18,133
- It's my passion... And as an expert...
- Please.

177
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,544
Only one tool has this paricular shape.

178
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,256
You ought to know

179
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:36,098
that only a perectly sharp knife

180
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:40,304
can sever the esophagus, the larynx
and the arery at a single stroke,

181
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:43,422
and those are the conditions
for kosher ritual slaughter.

182
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,696
Because?

183
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,975
Maybe the point is that
the animal shouldn't suffer?

184
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,823
I fell head-over-heels in love,
without a hope

185
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:58,655
- a provincial civil serant and a
big-city girl who'd been to stage school.

186
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,897
But two years later

187
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:06,141
we got married in Sandomierz
cathedral on Divine Mercy Sunday.

188
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,139
Unforunately

189
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,941
we never had any kids,
though we very much wanted to.

190
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:17,180
When it turned out we'd have to go
through all those medical procedures,

191
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:20,295
we considered adoption,
but finally we realized

192
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:22,895
we'd still be looking afer
children in our social work.

193
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:31,097
We spent most of the
last few days together.

194
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,418
We worked very hard in the winter,

195
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,858
so we decided to spend
Easter on our own.

196
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,542
On Sunday we slept in too late
for the Resurrection Mass,

197
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,427
had a modest but festive breakfast,

198
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:47,381
did some reading, talked a bit
and watched T.

199
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,499
That evening we went for a walk,

200
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:53,259
after that we looked in at the cathedral,
but not for mass,

201
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:56,738
just to pray for a while by the Tomb.

202
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:02,586
We actually spent all of Monday in bed,
Ela had a sore throat...

203
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,463
...it was real cold over Easter.

204
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:16,098
On Tuesday she was still feeling sick,

205
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,826
we had no obligations,
so we stayed home.

206
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:24,466
That evening we watched a Rober Redford
movie on channel one, about a jail,

207
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,143
I don't remember the title.
And we went to bed.

208
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:29,460
Early.
I had a headache.

209
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,388
When I woke up, Ela wasn't there.

210
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,264
Before I'd had time to get worried,
Basia Sobieraj called.

211
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:45,183
I'm glad you're questioning me.

212
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:48,787
It could be hard for Basia.

213
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,105
I'm questioning you
because I'm in charge of the inquiry.

214
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:54,069
Emotional considerations
have nothing to do with it.

215
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,182
What happened to your forehead?

216
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,903
I tripped and hit it on a cooking pan.

217
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,985
- We'll have to do a forensic examination.
- It's just a scratch.

218
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,261
Not because we're worried about you.

219
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,140
We have to check it isn't
the result of a fight or a wounding.

220
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,862
Don't you believe me?

221
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,420
You know of course that you can
refuse to make a statement

222
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:25,383
or to answer specific questions?

223
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,060
- Yes.
- But you prefer to tell lies.

224
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:31,145
Why is that?

225
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:40,547
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

226
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:43,271
- I've said...
- I know what you said.

227
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:47,751
Now please tell me when was the
last time you really saw your wife.

228
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,389
If you don't,
I'll detain you for 48 hours,

229
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,629
charge you with murder
and apply for an arrest warrant.

230
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,504
You've got thiry seconds...

231
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,585
Twenty...

232
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,667
- Ten...
- But I've said...

233
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:12,305
This is Szacki, please...

234
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,227
On Monday.

235
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:24,831
- Why did you lie?
- We'd had a row,

236
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,385
we'd shouted
and hurt each other's feelings...

237
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,993
O God, when I think that the last
words I ever said to her were

238
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:36,504
that she should take her
sorry ass back to Krakow...

239
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:41,192
I didn't run afer her,
I didn't go looking for her, I was furious.

240
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:44,870
I didn't want to apologize, I didn't
want to say sorry, I wanted to be alone.

241
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:50,189
On Tuesday evening
I started to miss her,

242
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,586
but my pride wouldn't
let me call her.

243
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,508
Didn't it occur to you that these facts
might be important to the investigation?

244
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,027
Doesn't finding her
killer matter to you?

245
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,314
No.

246
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,675
Nothing matters to me now.

247
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:28,874
Have you ever seen this tool before?

248
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,590
- Is that...?
- Please answer the question.

249
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:57,989
Mister Prosecutor...

250
00:24:58,037 --> 00:25:00,836
Please stop bugging me-it's the court
that draws up the list of experts.

251
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:04,037
But that's not what I've come about.
As I've explained, it's my passion, you see.

252
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:07,197
I've got the best collection in Poland.
And I just wanted to ask, no obligation...

253
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,233
- No.
- But why...

254
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:09,950
No. Goodbye.

255
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,797
You'll be sorry...

256
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,630
- The guy's obsessed!
- What's up?

257
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:19,910
Nothing, just a screwball trying to get the
murder weapon off me for his collection.

258
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:25,672
Why couldn't the Budniks have children?

259
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:29,510
He couldn't, right?

260
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:33,357
Right.

261
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:36,031
Why do you ask?

262
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,314
The way Budnik mentioned it,
as if just in passing.

263
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:44,798
That's how men talk when they've so
ofen been told it doesn't matter

264
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,518
that they almost believe it.

265
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,671
My husband can't have children either.

266
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,036
I tell him it doesn't matter too,
and that other things count.

267
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,871
And do they?

268
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,673
Less.

269
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,518
I've got a 10-year-old daughter.
She lives in Warsaw.

270
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,156
I feel as if from day to day

271
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,156
she's becoming more and more of
a stranger to me, fading out.

272
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,312
Even so I envy you.

273
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,956
This is a disabled parking place.

274
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,715
Hear.

275
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,999
I probably couldn't have
given birh anyway.

276
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,317
You're going to have to
trust somebody eventually.

277
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,832
Teodor.

278
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:06,596
Baska.

279
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:14,034
Tell me you're joking.

280
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,034
You have no idea what that means, do you?

281
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:25,038
It means that whoever dropped that knife was
hoping the fact would leak out to the media

282
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:28,194
and stir up some Polish-Jewish hysteria,
making things harder for us.

283
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:30,275
It's not going to be ordinary hysteria.

284
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:33,521
If anyone, God forbid, mentions
ritual murder, that'll be the end.

285
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:37,001
Ritual murder is a fairy tale that was
told to children to make them behave,

286
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:39,354
otherwise the big bad Jew would
come and gobble them up.

287
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,672
Wake up, Teodor.

288
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:44,558
Sandomierz is a place where accusations
of kidnapping children and pogroms

289
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,720
were once as regular as the seasons.

290
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:49,159
Where the Church endorsed that
sort of bestial attitude.

291
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:51,879
Where to this day there's a
painting hanging in the cathedral

292
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,835
showing Jews murdering
Catholic children.

293
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,996
Covered up, of course.

294
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:03,596
I've never seen anything like it before.

295
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,996
Take a look.

296
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:10,798
The body's dry, there's almost no blood.

297
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,353
How is that possible?

298
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,522
The perect slaughter,
like at an abattoir.

299
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:20,244
Somebody must have stunned her, hung her
upside down, slashed her throat and

300
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,084
let out the blood.

301
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,681
We must look for the blood.

302
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:28,880
You should find out what this is.

303
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,805
She had it in her clenched fist.

304
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:39,005
On Sunday they definitely
did go for a walk.

305
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:42,602
Before six the camera on
Mariacka Street caught them.

306
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:53,398
Everything looks OK, doesn't it?

307
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,886
On Monday,

308
00:28:57,006 --> 00:29:01,046
when in theory Mrs Budnik
had lef her husband...

309
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,278
she's not on any of the cameras.
Nor is he. On Tuesday it's the same.

310
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:07,240
But on Wednesday her corpse
is on the other side of town.

311
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:13,847
Where is that?

312
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,527
Zydowska Street.

313
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,599
The camera's on the wall
of the synagogue.

314
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,878
Right by the spot where
Mrs Budnik was found.

315
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:24,726
The recording is from Wednesday morning,
a few minutes before we got the report.

316
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:41,198
You know what used to be in the
spot where Mrs Budnik was found?

317
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:42,961
The old city walls?

318
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:45,006
The Jewish cemetery.

319
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:49,482
Her corpse was lying right
in the middle of it.

320
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,681
Don't you like having your photo taken?

321
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,484
The bathroom mirror is
distressing enough.

322
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:27,809
Which way exactly did your wife go out?

323
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,563
Sorry?

324
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,569
She didn't go down the street
- she's not on the video sureillance.

325
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,968
She can't have jumped over
the 10-foot cathedral wall.

326
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,364
Or out of the window, because there
are bars. Hence my curiosity.

327
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,562
Now that you say it,

328
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,761
I do in fact remember something.
Which way she went out on Monday.

329
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,723
Through the door.

330
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,480
You should probably take a close
look at it from the other side.

331
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:59,049
- Do you suspect me of something?
- Of murdering your wife.

332
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,602
- Why don't you arrest me?
- Are you going to confess?

333
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:05,723
- I'm innocent.
- Pity.

334
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,965
Do you recognize this symbol?

335
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:15,931
- It's a "Rodlo". Didn't you go to school?
- Have you got a badge like this?

336
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:29,126
Not a drop.

337
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:32,967
Nobody's so much as scratched themselves
in that house for the past six months.

338
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,084
Why don't we lock him up?

339
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:42,084
- It's him.
- I know.

340
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:43,851
But it's too little.

341
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:49,209
I have to know why, and I have to know how.
He won't tell us that in the can.

342
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,165
Keep an eye on him.

343
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:54,923
Mister Inspector...

344
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,849
Give me a break, Gasiorowski.
How many times is it now?

345
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:01,692
- And it always ends the same way, right?
- Well, yes, but...

346
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:05,130
- But what?
- But it's a week now since Tolo's been gone.

347
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:08,047
Gasiorowski, for pity's sake.

348
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:10,443
The police chase bums away,
they don't go looking for them.

349
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,172
And cerainly not bums
from another county.

350
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:16,726
- Yes, I know, but...
- There's nothing more to say, goodbye.

351
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:22,890
We've got to find out where the
blood from the cadaver has gone.

352
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,446
Into the matzos.

353
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,089
My husband explained it to me.

354
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:37,208
Look, it symbolizes the shape of the
River Vistula on the map of Poland.

355
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:41,491
It turns right, then runs a long way
upward at an angle, then right again.

356
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:43,049
The little tassel

357
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:46,289
is where the Vistula
flows through Krakow.

358
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:52,648
The Union of Poles in Germany
designed it as their emblem in 1933.

359
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,848
They persuaded the Nazis that it was
their version of the swastika.

360
00:32:56,095 --> 00:33:00,214
- And? Does this union still exist?
- Yes, it's quite an active society.

361
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,927
Apart from that, the "Rodlo"
is also a symbol of being Polish

362
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:08,655
- several scout packs use it,
and a couple of nationalist organizations.

363
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:11,371
Nationalist meaning anti-gay?

364
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,451
No, more like the
reasonable nationalists,

365
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:17,774
- the patriotic types.
- Reasonable nationalists?

366
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:20,614
Are we playing at oxymorons?

367
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:27,047
It may be unfashionable in Warsaw,

368
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:32,893
but in the provinces some people like to
feel proud of the fact that they're Polish.

369
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,448
Jerzy Szyller is an honorary member
of the Union of Poles in Germany.

370
00:33:41,537 --> 00:33:43,893
And who exactly is Jerzy Szyller?

371
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:47,617
You're joking, surely?

372
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:49,776
Szyller.

373
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:54,012
Not a week goes by without someone
coming to complain about him.

374
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:58,096
Last time it was that his dog had crapped
at the foot of the statue of John Paul Il,

375
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:02,771
offending the religious feelings of
the Catholic citizens of Sandomierz,

376
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:06,534
and breaking aricle
196 of the Penal Code.

377
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,008
- Is that a joke?
- No.

378
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,050
Nor is it an exception.

379
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:13,970
I wish I had a zloty a month

380
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,217
from every citizen of Sandomierz
who hates him like poison.

381
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:19,210
Do they hate him for
any specific reason?

382
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:20,852
He's rich,

383
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:24,171
good-looking, he's got a big house
and a flashy car.

384
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,419
Round here that can only mean one thing:

385
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,417
that he's a crook

386
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:33,095
who oppresses the poor and made his
money at the expense of others.

387
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,251
And what's the truth?

388
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:37,933
Be my guest...

389
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:41,377
The truth is that
Jerzy Szyller is a businessman

390
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,411
who's clever with real estate.

391
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:45,015
He's clean.

392
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,331
What was his relationship
with the Budniks?

393
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,260
The guy's a patriot, a philanthropist,

394
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,378
he financed her shows for children.

395
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,858
Szyller...

396
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,612
A Jew?

397
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,620
If you believe the informers,
yes, 100 percent.

398
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,776
Also a pederast, who practices bestiality
and worships Satan.

399
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,293
Not on the wet...

400
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,457
I found my birthday.

401
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,589
That's not a birthday.

402
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:47,378
That's a prediction of how
you'll meet your end.

403
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:02,417
Are you a patriot?

404
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:07,262
Of course.
Aren't you?

405
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:11,056
Do you like the patriotic
paintings in the cathedral?

406
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:13,975
I'm not sure if this is
relevant to our conversation...

407
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:19,545
but I think the greatest and most harmful
idiocy in the history of Poland

408
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,299
is the identification of patriotism
with that pedophile sect.

409
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:27,897
Patriotism without the Virgin Mary?
You're inventing a new quality.

410
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,736
It only takes a bit of common sense

411
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:34,058
to see that the Church is
behind all our worst disasters.

412
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:37,424
That bloodthirsty myth about being
the bulwark of Christianity,

413
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:42,502
all that pornographic lust for martyrdom,
the idleness, envy, and sexual neuroses.

414
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,944
Polish law is drawn up
according to the dictates

415
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,898
of that onanistic mafia
in black skirs.

416
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,261
I am a patriot,

417
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:53,339
but please don't insult
me by suspecting me

418
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,379
of placing one particular
superstition above others,

419
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:56,622
and calling it patriotism.

420
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,946
Are you familiar with this symbol?

421
00:38:04,427 --> 00:38:07,067
It's a "Rodlo"
- for us it's really a sacred sign.

422
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:09,872
Do your Union members often
wear something like this?

423
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:12,945
Only those who are actively involved.
You won't buy that off a Turk.

424
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:16,578
- You have one, naturally?
- Naturally.

425
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,585
May I see it?

426
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:33,582
That's odd...

427
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:38,103
- But you can't find it.
- No, I can't.

428
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,068
We removed it from the victim's hand.

429
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:42,859
- Elzbieta's hand.
- The victim, Elzbieta.

430
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:48,425
Where were you on Monday and Tuesday?

431
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,098
At home.

432
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:53,908
Did anyone visit you?

433
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,941
Friends, acquaintances?

434
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:59,021
Do you often have visitors,
on the whole?

435
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:03,384
I'm not particularly sociable.

436
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:07,701
And this place is special to me,
a sor of refuge.

437
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,183
I like being here on my own.

438
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,026
May I see the picture that used
to stand on the mantelpiece?

439
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,345
I'm sorry?

440
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,825
I'd like to see the picture that
was standing on the mantelpiece.

441
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,669
- There wasn't any...
- Are you going to show it to me or not?

442
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,470
A woman who's been brutally murdered
had a badge in her clenched fist

443
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,462
that you can't find.

444
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,028
And you can't explain what
might have happened to it.

445
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,587
Nor can you prove where you were
when the murder was committed.

446
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,589
And yet you're telling me lies.

447
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:39,146
I find that very surprising.

448
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,431
You're easily surprised, Prosecutor.

449
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,941
Does such a childish trait come
in useful in your profession?

450
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:54,503
I should lock you up
and then wonder what next.

451
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:57,504
What's stopping you?

452
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:03,469
I can't see a reason why you
would have killed your lover.

453
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:05,944
Especially in that way.

454
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,747
- Stop playing the fool.
- The picture.

455
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,911
You don't understand a thing.

456
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:16,582
This is a small town.

457
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:18,944
They're always going to say

458
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:22,306
- she was a whore, a loose woman.
- The picture. Right now.

459
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:26,788
Was the victim planning
to leave her husband?

460
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:30,385
Did you discuss it?

461
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,512
It can't have been pleasant for you.

462
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:36,113
Knowing that she got into
bed with him every night,

463
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,265
gave him a goodnight kiss

464
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:41,502
and did what married couples usually do.

465
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,666
- On Monday I was expecting her.
- Sorry?

466
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:53,148
On Easter Monday she was going
to come to me for good.

467
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,946
On Tuesday we were going to
leave and never come back.

468
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:01,547
Does that mean she was going to
tell her husband about you?

469
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:07,467
I don't know.

470
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:13,429
Mr Budnik, open up, it's the police!

471
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:17,834
Mr Budnik!

472
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:13,486
I've studied in Warsaw,
I've studied in Göttingen,

473
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:16,993
I've done a lot of travelling,
I've lived in three capital cities.

474
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:20,241
I won't hide the fact that
I've had a lot of men too.

475
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:24,473
Every single one of
them was a great guy.

476
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:27,762
Even if we came to the conclusion
that we weren't necessarily suited,

477
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:29,714
they were still great.

478
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:34,597
You're the first real dick
to have stood in my way.

479
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:40,282
A civil serant who's twenty years older
than you, who's been through the mill.

480
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,555
What could you hope to build with me?

481
00:44:43,923 --> 00:44:46,597
Nothing anymore.
But I wanted to.

482
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:51,035
I was feeling keener by the day
to give you more.

483
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:55,794
But you saw me as a
provincial cocksucker.

484
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,077
There's no need to be crude.

485
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:01,443
You're the one that's crude, Teo.

486
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:05,798
In every thought about me you're

487
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:11,757
a crude, vulgar, boorish mysoginist
and common sexist.

488
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,637
A sad little pen-pusher too.

489
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:22,078
Turn around.

490
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:40,245
Stop it...

491
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:50,595
Janek...

492
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,965
Szacki, Szacki...

493
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,923
Mister Prosecutor,

494
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:55,175
Mister Prosecutor,
a word of comment please?

495
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,970
There'll be a press conference tomorrow,
we'll tell you the whole story.

496
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:58,815
Is it a serial killer?

497
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,130
Tomorrow. Today I'd have nothing but hearsay
for you, tomorrow we'll have information.

498
00:48:02,165 --> 00:48:03,405
- Hearsay will do.
- No it won't.

499
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,841
The man wanted for the previous
murder has been killed.

500
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,928
Does that mean the investigation
is at a standstill?

501
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,530
Not in the least.

502
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:15,728
- You should close the schools.
- Why close the schools?

503
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:22,044
To protect the children.

504
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:24,607
- I'm sorry, from what?
- From the blood ritual.

505
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,846
Have you gone crazy?

506
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,930
I don't understand why we haven't
got the courage to wonder out loud

507
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:32,561
if afer all these years ritual
murder hasn't returned to Poland?

508
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,085
You're out of your mind.

509
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:38,966
I'm not asserting it, I'm just asking.

510
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:41,163
Ritual murder is an anti-Semitic
legend, not a reality.

511
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,643
In every legend there's
a grain of truth.

512
00:48:44,452 --> 00:48:47,763
In legal history a lot of people
were legitimately convicted

513
00:48:47,812 --> 00:48:50,008
for kidnapping and killing
children in a similar way.

514
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,964
And so were lots of witches.

515
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:55,085
Do you think witches have come back
to the Most Serene Commonwealth too?

516
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:58,165
Are they screwing with the devil and
plotting to dethrone Christ the King?

517
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:01,329
That's just political correctness,
it won't change the facts.

518
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:05,811
And the facts are two bodies, murdered
according to the old Jewish blood ritual,

519
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:09,330
practiced for centuries
all over the world.

520
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:13,169
A rabbi's son from Rome wrote that
it really happens, there's proof,

521
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:16,132
statements by witnesses,
it's not a medieval legend...

522
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:18,642
Please listen to me,
because I'm only going to say it once.

523
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:21,013
The one and only thing
that interests me is this:

524
00:49:21,048 --> 00:49:23,293
finding the culprit
and bringing him to trial.

525
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:26,486
I couldn't care less if it's Karol
Wojtyla come back from the dead,

526
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:29,652
Ahmed from the kebab stall,
or some bloodthirsty Jew,

527
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,009
baking matzos in a cellar.

528
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:35,134
Whoever it may or may not be, he'll be
dragged out of hiding by the side-locks,

529
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:37,570
braids or whatever,

530
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:39,566
and made to answer for what he's done.

531
00:49:40,094 --> 00:49:41,653
You have my guarantee.

532
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:45,486
OK, once again.

533
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:50,604
Not old phone numbers.

534
00:49:50,975 --> 00:49:52,887
Not police ID numbers.

535
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:56,289
Not passport or ID card numbers
from the KWP series.

536
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:58,327
Nothing like that.
Not social security numbers.

537
00:49:59,095 --> 00:50:01,690
No database known to our bureaucracy
is bringing up any results

538
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,448
that might make sense.

539
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,175
Dates?

540
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:09,005
No, unless it's a sort of
prediction about the 23rd century.

541
00:50:12,895 --> 00:50:15,330
Geographical coordinates?

542
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,808
Libya.

543
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,136
The killer cerainly doesn't
want us to catch him,

544
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:59,010
so if he's not totally round the twist,

545
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,727
he's not going to leave a riddle we only
have to solve in order to find him.

546
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:05,209
Unless he is round the twist.

547
00:51:06,737 --> 00:51:08,650
What about the underground passage?

548
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,735
The fire fighters failed to dig through
to anywhere. They gave up. Too risky.

549
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:14,810
The miners can start on Tuesday.

550
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:18,011
So what now?

551
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:19,374
Let's go to bed.

552
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:23,332
I haven't brought my lacy underwear,

553
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:26,418
so if you'd be willing to
postpone until another day...

554
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:29,258
You guys sure are horny
out in the provinces.

555
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:35,017
Long winters, long nights,
no cinema, boring stuff on TV.

556
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,495
What can you do?

557
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,092
Sleep.

558
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,172
This is Szacki.

559
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,531
I've got a client who wants you to do
some digging around in the archives.

560
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,936
At this time of day?
Who's that?

561
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,575
CINEMAK
www. CINEMAK.PRV.PL

562
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:31,615
KWP? Konspiracyjne Wojsko Polskie.
(Polish Underground Army)

563
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:39,060
Good day, Mister Prosecutor.

564
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:47,538
Congratulations! These days it takes a lot of
courage to say these things straight out.

565
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:50,695
- Don't forget, we're all behind you.
- Who?

566
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:53,741
We ordinary, real Poles.

567
00:52:54,102 --> 00:52:55,536
Good luck!

568
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:22,540
"I'll drag him out of hiding by
the side-locks! Guaranteed!"

569
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:30,418
...hundreds of miles of corridors, underground
chambers, storerooms and cellars.

570
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:33,063
An eerie labyrinth dug out
over the centuries...

571
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,534
which nobody has ever fully
explored to this day.

572
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:41,056
They stretch far beyond Sandomierz
and go down many levels.

573
00:53:41,423 --> 00:53:44,815
According to legend,
Halina Krepianka went mad with grief,

574
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:48,773
because she had lost everyone she
loved and everyone who loved her...

575
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:54,057
...Just a moment...

576
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:07,054
- I want to talk to you.
- But I don't want to talk to you.

577
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:08,535
Please.

578
00:54:11,145 --> 00:54:13,057
I'm the one to say please.

579
00:54:13,985 --> 00:54:16,864
Please don't try proving to me
that as well as being a shit,

580
00:54:16,945 --> 00:54:20,416
you can also be a pathetic limp dick.

581
00:54:27,745 --> 00:54:30,738
In that case I'm going back to work.

582
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:35,503
Please Miss, the boys heard howling.

583
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:44,380
Just imagine, lately I took part in a
contest for the most Polish word of all.

584
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,544
Do you know what I suggested?

585
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:51,219
The word zolc, meaning "bile".

586
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:53,056
For two reasons.

587
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:57,504
Firstly, it consists of nothing but
accented letters that only exist in Polish.

588
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:02,027
Secondly, it symbolizes
the true nature of our society.

589
00:55:02,987 --> 00:55:08,985
Embitterment, frustration,
lack of fulfilment, constant dissatisfaction.

590
00:55:10,467 --> 00:55:13,824
- Why have I brought this up?
- We're all wondering about that.

591
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:18,623
Because apar from the crime of passion,
there's also the crime of bile.

592
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:21,986
Passion is a sudden outburst
of emotion, isn't it?

593
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:23,980
Bile is something else.

594
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:27,744
Bile accumulates slowly,
in tiny droplets.

595
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:30,060
Eventually there's nothing else
inside of us.

596
00:55:30,508 --> 00:55:34,058
We'd do anything not to feel any more
of this bitterness, this humiliation.

597
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:37,948
And I think that's what
we're dealing with here.

598
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,385
So we're getting down to facts.

599
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:43,427
Absolutely, surely you didn't think I'd
screw the entire day away like this?

600
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:45,102
Well...

601
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:48,627
If not for the undoubted fact

602
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,985
that the culprit is one
and the same person,

603
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:54,665
I'd suggest that in the case of the second
murder we're dealing with a copycat.

604
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:57,663
- There are too many differences here.
- Such as?

605
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:59,941
Both victims bled to death.

606
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,663
Apparently a similarity.
But let's look at the details.

607
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,384
The male victim has precisely
severed femoral areries.

608
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,782
An elegant solution,

609
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,509
the blood flows rapidly,
down the legs, and that's it.

610
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,144
Whereas the female victim

611
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:17,188
has her throat slit so that
it looks like a gill,

612
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:19,785
which means lots of frenzied slashes.

613
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,303
He wanted to punish,
humiliate, and disfigure her.

614
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:29,661
So the first crime was one "of bile", in
theory it should have closed the matter.

615
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:33,546
Once the murder's committed, the bile
flows out with the victim's blood,

616
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:39,184
then comes peace,
followed by guilt, pangs of conscience.

617
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,342
So why did he kill again?

618
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,863
For now we don't know,

619
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:49,464
but I advise accepting that the key
to the riddle is the first murder.

620
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:52,463
Is he going to attack again?

621
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:55,466
He doesn't fit the profile
of a serial killer.

622
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,747
It looks more like
the fulfillment of a plan,

623
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,301
naturally vengeance is the
motive that suggests itself.

624
00:57:00,471 --> 00:57:02,144
What is there to imply that?

625
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:04,986
The inscription left
at the scene of the crime.

626
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:08,823
If the matter were closed, he wouldn't
feel like playing little games.

627
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,506
So it's a little game?

628
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:12,948
Or a way of communicating
what the revenge is about.

629
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:15,831
Often for those seeking
revenge, death is not enough.

630
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,832
Infamy is imporant too,

631
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:20,950
the world has to know what the
victims were punished for.

632
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:26,267
Supposing there is still someone
on his list, who might it be?

633
00:57:26,472 --> 00:57:31,103
Someone from his family,
or maybe a long-standing friend...

634
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,507
Yes?

635
00:57:46,073 --> 00:57:47,348
You won't believe it.

636
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:55,831
We can't blame ourselves.

637
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,069
We didn't have enough to lock him up.

638
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:02,711
And house arrest, even so,
it was a couresy on his par.

639
00:58:03,154 --> 00:58:05,066
No signs of a struggle.

640
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,108
Either he walked out,
or he was carried out.

641
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:11,754
Issue an arrest warrant?

642
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:15,350
No, we've had enough humiliation
for one case.

643
00:58:18,554 --> 00:58:21,194
I don't want to find in a shor
while that our new chief suspect

644
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:23,146
is hanging on a hook somewhere.

645
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:29,675
Inform the media that we're
looking for an important witness,

646
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,235
and we'll stick to that version.

647
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,794
Don't move.

648
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:53,633
Screwed-up joker.

649
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,068
What's the origin of matzos?

650
00:58:57,356 --> 00:58:59,268
When they fled from Egypt,

651
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:03,027
they hadn't time to wait
for the dough to rise

652
00:59:03,196 --> 00:59:05,153
they had to bake something
to eat quickly,

653
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:06,870
and the result was matzos.

654
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:11,068
Do you think this is a serial killer?

655
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:13,588
That he won't stop?

656
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:18,076
That he's going to go on kidnapping,
murdering and blood-letting?

657
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:21,508
- Pick all this up.
- Where are you going?

658
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:23,469
To the church.

659
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:28,352
Not on the wet.

660
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:30,875
Hey!

661
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,035
That's not allowed!

662
00:59:56,758 --> 00:59:59,068
Every inch has to be
photographed and examined,

663
00:59:59,118 --> 01:00:01,792
even if you guys star
fainting with exhaustion.

664
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:06,556
- It must be some sort of code.
- I even know which-it's an alphabet.

665
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,517
Do you know Hebrew, Father?

666
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:11,870
<i>The first and third words are ein,</i>

667
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:16,152
<i>the middle one is tehet or tahat.</i>

668
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,238
Unforunately I don't know
what they mean.

669
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:23,353
<i>Ein could be one, like in German,</i>

670
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,159
but then it would be Yiddish,
not Hebrew.

671
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:30,798
Yes, we had Bible studies with
elements of Hebrew at the seminary.

672
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,798
But I wasn't always listening,

673
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,670
it was the first class of the day,
we were tired afer the pogroms...

674
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,795
Teo...

675
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:12,361
"This is my commandment, that you love
one another as I have loved you. "

676
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:20,713
I need a copy of the Bible.
On the double!

677
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:27,757
Which books of the Bible star
with the letter K in Polish?

678
01:01:27,962 --> 01:01:31,273
<i>Kaplanska [Leviticus], Krolewskie [Kings],
Kroniki [Chronicles]</i>

679
01:01:31,322 --> 01:01:32,487
<i>and Koheleta [Ecclesiastes].</i>

680
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,401
<i>In the New Testament we have the two
letters to the Koryntiany [Corinthians]</i>

681
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,807
<i>and one to the Kolosany [Colossans].</i>

682
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:39,482
- Which of those books is part of the Torah?
- Leviticus.

683
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:44,519
- Chapter 24, verses 19 to 21.
- Oh, of course...

684
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:50,877
"If a man causes disfigurement
to his neighbor,

685
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,394
as he has done,
so shall it be done to him

686
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:58,996
- fracture for fracture,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth;

687
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:03,033
whoever kills a man
shall be put to death. "

688
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:09,239
<i>W must be for Wyjscia[Exodus],
chapter 21, verses 22 to 25.</i>

689
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:16,602
"If men fight, and hur
a woman with child,

690
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:18,640
so that she gives birh prematurely,

691
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,319
he shall pay as the judge determines.

692
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:24,477
But if any harm follows,

693
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:30,516
then you shall give life for life,
eye for eye... "

694
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:34,804
<i>And a book starting with P,
it's Prawo, right?</i>

695
01:02:35,404 --> 01:02:37,964
<i>Poworzonego Prawa [Deuteronomy].</i>

696
01:02:39,764 --> 01:02:42,836
Chapter 19, verses 16 to 21.

697
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:53,922
"If a false witness testifies
against any man of wrongdoing,

698
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:58,045
then you shall do to him as he thought
to have done to his brother:,

699
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:00,756
so you shall put away
the evil from among you.

700
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:04,276
And those who remain
shall hear and fear,

701
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:06,357
and not again commit such evil:

702
01:03:07,525 --> 01:03:09,437
life shall be for life,

703
01:03:09,765 --> 01:03:11,120
eye for eye. "

704
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:15,562
It seems the meaning of the
message has been explained.

705
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,680
An eye for an eye...

706
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,878
You were right.
It's all there in the past.

707
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:26,605
I need names.

708
01:03:26,646 --> 01:03:28,286
I still have to go to two
more archives tomorrow.

709
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,686
Today.

710
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:33,158
You've had practise
at sitting up all night.

711
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:36,441
If they give you any
trouble, call this number.

712
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:38,246
We must hurry.

713
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:40,360
The deputy minister.
He's been warned.

714
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:44,596
Killing, the death
of a pregnant woman, perjury.

715
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:45,564
Look for those.

716
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:02,406
JEWISH CEMETERY,
HALL OF MEMORY IN LUBLIN

717
01:04:28,128 --> 01:04:30,405
Good evening,
I'm looking for Rabbi Zygmunt.

718
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,807
I've come to see your father.

719
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,401
A Pole with a sense of humor,
that's great.

720
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,404
Glass of wine?

721
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,885
Coffee.

722
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,410
I don't like talking about the Shoah.

723
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:21,048
I don't like the fact that every
conversation between Catholic Poles and Jews

724
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,730
goes back to...

725
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:23,887
that.

726
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:26,003
As if there hadn't been 700 years

727
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,562
of shared history before that,
and everything after it.

728
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:32,206
Just dead bodies and nothing else.

729
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,083
Imagine

730
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:48,004
coming home,

731
01:05:48,092 --> 01:05:52,689
and finding a man living in your house who
blackmailed Jews hiding during the war,

732
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:55,292
who caused your entire family
to die in a camp.

733
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:58,963
Your wife and children.

734
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:02,004
Could you restrain yourself?

735
01:06:04,052 --> 01:06:05,964
Forgive him?

736
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:09,052
Love him as yourself?

737
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:17,285
Do you have a family?

738
01:06:19,933 --> 01:06:21,526
Yes.

739
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:24,244
I did have.
Until recently.

740
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:29,287
Then you can imagine those
emotions better than I can.

741
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:33,613
For me it's abstract,
academic consideration.

742
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:39,933
Matzos...

743
01:06:40,214 --> 01:06:42,649
With chocolate, delicious.

744
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,493
Want some?

745
01:07:01,734 --> 01:07:05,126
Do the initials KWP
mean anything to you?

746
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:09,126
<i>Komenda Wojewodzka Policji
[District Polish HQ]?</i>

747
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:18,410
<i>What about Konspiracyjne Wojsko Polskie
[Polish Underground Army]?</i>

748
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,609
The anti-communist partisans.

749
01:07:23,215 --> 01:07:25,684
Flawless heroes for some,

750
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:28,695
troublemakers for others,

751
01:07:29,136 --> 01:07:33,653
for yet others Jew-baiters
who organized pogroms.

752
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,456
Were there incidents of that kind?

753
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:40,051
They were generally right-wing units.

754
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:43,049
That sor of pre-war, nationalist right

755
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:45,891
was shot through with anti-Semitism.

756
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,294
But

757
01:07:50,296 --> 01:07:52,208
the "cursed soldiers"

758
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:55,609
also fought against functionaries
of the state apparatus.

759
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:58,367
Jews were killed in the fighting,

760
01:07:58,697 --> 01:08:01,531
because there were lots of them
in the secret police.

761
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:05,329
Of course you know
why I'm asking all these questions?

762
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,568
Because you're wondering
if it might be the work

763
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:11,008
of a Jew, obsessed with
the desire for revenge.

764
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:14,171
And you want to know if it's possible.

765
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:19,970
If we were talking about someone normal,
I'd say no,

766
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:24,134
but anyone who has two people's
blood on his hands is a madman.

767
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:27,372
And with madmen anything's possible.

768
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:33,490
- There's another thing too...
- Yes?

769
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:35,810
All this...

770
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:39,410
Sandomierz, the painting, the quotes,

771
01:08:39,538 --> 01:08:42,576
the knife for shechita,
the corpse in a barrel...

772
01:08:44,378 --> 01:08:47,929
You can't acquire all that
knowledge in a weekend.

773
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:52,339
In theory you'd have to be a Jew.

774
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:54,451
Why in theory?

775
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:01,371
Because in practise someone's
putting a lot of effor

776
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:04,891
into fooling the prosecutor.

777
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:08,610
That's my impression.

778
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:13,453
<i>That's het,</i>

779
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,377
the eighth letter
of the Hebrew alphabet.

780
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,859
It's the mirror image
of a correctly written letter.

781
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,776
No Jew would write it that way,
not even a mad one.

782
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,451
Just as even if you were very drunk

783
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,460
you wouldn't write a B with
the loops to the lef.

784
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,496
See?

785
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:44,894
I think someone's just cunning,

786
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:47,581
trying to resurrect enough demons

787
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:49,773
to be able to hide among them.

788
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:54,660
The question, my dear Prosecutor,

789
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:58,054
is whether in the crowd of phantoms

790
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:02,381
you'll be able to make out
the face of the killer.

791
01:12:58,948 --> 01:13:00,428
I need your help.

792
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:05,949
Even if this is just a bad dream,
I'm telling you for once and for all...

793
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:09,420
Even if it's a dream it's not one in which
I'm interested in your emotional state.

794
01:13:09,509 --> 01:13:11,865
I need your help as a prosecutor.

795
01:13:12,269 --> 01:13:15,546
- Just tell me it's...
- Exactly. A matter of life and death.

796
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:31,461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

797
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:39,982
This place was built as the junior clerical
seminary, it's called Nazareth House.

798
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,944
During the war the Gestapo was in here,
afer the war the secret police,

799
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,863
and now it's a hostel
for clerical students.

800
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,504
Why are we going in here?

801
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,108
Because if the prosecutor is right,

802
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:54,703
this holy building contains
the gates of hell.

803
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:04,711
Listen, just here, behind this wall
is the tourist route.

804
01:15:04,753 --> 01:15:07,632
So if the prosecutor is right

805
01:15:08,033 --> 01:15:10,832
and the kids really did hear noises...

806
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:26,186
we should be hearing them even louder.

807
01:15:40,315 --> 01:15:43,467
- Can you tell where that is?
- The echo is misleading,

808
01:15:43,715 --> 01:15:46,628
but I'd say to the west,
towards the synagogue.

809
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,790
- Where are we now?
- Here,

810
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:20,986
under the walls,
with the Old Town on our lef.

811
01:16:31,957 --> 01:16:33,869
- Let's keep going.
- Let's go back.

812
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:35,557
What are we looking for anyway?

813
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:37,430
Szyller.

814
01:16:37,517 --> 01:16:39,588
So far whenever someone has
disappeared in this case

815
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,549
he's been found later on
trussed like a piglet...

816
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:43,789
You mean like a lamb.

817
01:16:44,237 --> 01:16:46,069
<i>Pork's not treif.</i>

818
01:16:46,557 --> 01:16:47,673
Not kosher.

819
01:16:47,717 --> 01:16:50,322
At any rate we've got a chance of
finding someone sooner this time.

820
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:53,157
- How do you know there's a connection?
- Howling, barking, it all fits.

821
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,477
Are you crazy?
Where the hell does barking fit into this?

822
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:57,276
What's in that painting?

823
01:16:57,398 --> 01:16:59,833
Victims with their throats slit,
or rolled in a barrel of blood,

824
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:01,790
and remains being thrown to dogs.

825
01:17:04,118 --> 01:17:05,837
What haven't we seen yet?

826
01:17:06,518 --> 01:17:08,157
Oh God.

827
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:14,194
- Got a gun?
- Yes.

828
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,432
- Let's go back!
- No!

829
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,720
I have to see where they ran from.

830
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:10,677
But there's no more howling!

831
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:05,634
Quick, let's get him down!

832
01:19:15,483 --> 01:19:18,521
Szyller, who was it?

833
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:21,672
- Who was it?
- Teo...

834
01:19:53,724 --> 01:19:57,799
- No... no... no... no...
- Stop!

835
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,321
Faster, Teo, please!

836
01:20:21,245 --> 01:20:24,080
Rush to the surace, fast as
you can, call an ambulance.

837
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,484
Quickly!

838
01:20:49,087 --> 01:20:51,363
- I can't do it.
- Yes you can, just a bit more.

839
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:54,042
If I don't make it,
there's something you should know.

840
01:20:54,087 --> 01:20:57,080
Fuck it, man.
Let's just get out of here.

841
01:21:56,409 --> 01:22:00,369
<i>Excuse me, but why do I have to find
out you're in hospital from the TV?</i>

842
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:02,644
I'm fine.

843
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:05,523
<i>I'm not asking how you are,
because I don't give a shit.</i>

844
01:22:05,689 --> 01:22:08,210
<i>I'm asking why my daughter
is calling from school in hysterics,</i>

845
01:22:08,245 --> 01:22:10,008
<i>but I don't know what's happened.</i>

846
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,604
<i>Are you really all right?</i>

847
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,405
Just bruises.

848
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,201
Sorry, I was asleep. I had no idea
there was anything in the media.

849
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,360
<i>Well, now you know there is.</i>

850
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,720
<i>About you, about an underground
explosion, and some shooting.</i>

851
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:24,564
<i>Have you gone completely mad?
Have you forgotten you have a child?</i>

852
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:28,320
<i>All right, if you're having a mid-life crisis,
get yourself a fucking motorbike, man.</i>

853
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,724
<i>It's bad enough being a divorcee,
I don't want to be a widow too.</i>

854
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,650
<i>How does that sound?
As if I were 60.</i>

855
01:22:34,011 --> 01:22:36,890
I don't think you can be a widow
if you're divorced.

856
01:22:36,971 --> 01:22:41,807
<i>Don't you tell me who I can and can't be
- those dark days are over, luckily.</i>

857
01:22:42,211 --> 01:22:45,010
<i>- Wera...
- Let me know when you getout, OK?</i>

858
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:48,642
<i>That everything's all right. So I can
tell Helka. So she won't be worried.</i>

859
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:51,326
<i>- And look afer yourself.
- OK.</i>

860
01:23:13,532 --> 01:23:17,287
The old man's fine.
He'll outlive us all.

861
01:23:18,932 --> 01:23:20,161
They did some tests

862
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:23,171
and sent him home with orders to
have a large drink and sleep it off.

863
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,926
She's alive.

864
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:42,727
But if she'd reached the operating table a few
minutes later they'd never have saved her.

865
01:23:43,773 --> 01:23:46,333
They've put her in a drug-induced coma.

866
01:24:05,094 --> 01:24:09,566
We shouldn't have gone down there,
we should have sent the forensic expers.

867
01:24:09,654 --> 01:24:11,805
Teo, we're civil serants,

868
01:24:12,054 --> 01:24:13,966
not some sort of agents.

869
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:16,775
What kind of a sick action was that?

870
01:24:17,215 --> 01:24:19,127
We thought there was a
chance of saving Szyller.

871
01:24:19,175 --> 01:24:21,087
Yes, but we were wrong.

872
01:24:27,575 --> 01:24:28,645
I'm sorry.

873
01:24:31,895 --> 01:24:32,885
Really?

874
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:37,927
Easily said.

875
01:24:39,055 --> 01:24:40,648
I did as you said.

876
01:24:40,695 --> 01:24:45,248
I looked at all the serices and checked who
was first to issue the news from Sandomierz.

877
01:24:45,576 --> 01:24:47,488
One blogger was always first.

878
01:24:47,976 --> 01:24:49,888
The others picked it up afer him.

879
01:24:50,056 --> 01:24:52,332
First the websites,
then the TV, then everyone.

880
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:55,255
This is the first entry,
about the body below the synagogue.

881
01:24:55,736 --> 01:24:57,728
The very first entry on the blog.

882
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,486
This is the killer's blog.

883
01:25:00,216 --> 01:25:02,048
At that time not even
I knew about the incident

884
01:25:02,096 --> 01:25:03,530
I got the call just before five.

885
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,528
Or it's the blog of one
of the investigators.

886
01:25:05,936 --> 01:25:07,291
Or both.

887
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:26,450
<i>Sometimes you'll be trying to figure out
who's really with whom and why.</i>

888
01:25:26,617 --> 01:25:27,767
<i>That's when I'll help you.</i>

889
01:25:27,857 --> 01:25:30,975
<i>I've been running my own
inquiries for seven years,</i>

890
01:25:31,057 --> 01:25:32,970
<i>and now I'm being taken off
Ela's murder.</i>

891
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:34,930
<i>Nobody here likes Budnik.</i>

892
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:37,016
<i>You're going to have to
trust somebody eventually.</i>

893
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:40,017
<i>Her corpse was lying right in the middle
of the old Jewish cemetery.</i>

894
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:41,418
<i>There's something you should know...</i>

895
01:26:00,139 --> 01:26:01,732
I know who did it.

896
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:05,737
And I know why.

897
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,657
In spring 1946...

898
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:14,732
the country had been devastated
by the war, there was no food,

899
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:17,408
but there was the new
communist regime.

900
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:20,378
There was an empty space where the
Jewish district had once been,

901
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:24,299
and the best houses
had been occupied by Poles.

902
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,012
The real estate had all been claimed,

903
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,376
so had the possessions left
behind in safekeeping.

904
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,738
Every returning Jew
meant a pang of conscience...

905
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,100
Just before Easter, before Passover

906
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,531
a Jewish family arrived here.
They were strangers,

907
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,492
no one in Sandomierz
had seen them before.

908
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:45,095
He was a doctor, named Wajsbrot,

909
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,252
Chaim Wajsbrot.

910
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,731
The fact that they were strangers
helped them.

911
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,700
They weren't returning
to their old haunts,

912
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:55,496
no one had to look them in the eye
and explain away the new sideboard

913
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:59,091
- they were just victims of war,
and he could help out too.

914
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:03,937
Before the war the mansion on
Zamkowa Street belonged to Dr Weiss,

915
01:27:04,421 --> 01:27:06,106
a Jewish doctor who was
greatly respected.

916
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:09,612
And it was here by chance that
Wajsbrot and his family settled.

917
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:11,580
So why is it empty?

918
01:27:11,941 --> 01:27:13,741
Officially because of ownership issues,

919
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:16,735
unofficially the place is haunted.

920
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,497
- Haunted?
- By ghosts.

921
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:23,654
We're just coming to it.

922
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:28,615
As Wajsbrot cured one child
afer another of TB,

923
01:27:28,782 --> 01:27:30,580
the news quickly spread.

924
01:27:30,742 --> 01:27:34,577
According to rumor, he had penicillin.
From America.

925
01:27:34,902 --> 01:27:37,371
- Wajsbrot was approached by...
- Let me guess:

926
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:39,096
the "cursed soldiers"?

927
01:27:39,382 --> 01:27:41,135
Exactly.
The KWP.

928
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,340
They approached him,
demanding a contribution

929
01:27:43,463 --> 01:27:46,581
for their fight against
the Red invaders,

930
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:48,981
in the form of antibiotics.

931
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:51,415
Wajsbrot told them to get lost...

932
01:27:53,943 --> 01:27:57,903
Apparently they only managed to
save their doctor by a miracle.

933
01:27:58,503 --> 01:28:02,463
But the KWP major couldn't swallow
the insult of being refused by a Jew.

934
01:28:02,623 --> 01:28:04,182
So he came back and killed him?

935
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:07,656
He denounced him.
To the loathsome Reds.

936
01:28:08,104 --> 01:28:11,859
It didn't take much, he just had to
mention the American penicillin...

937
01:28:12,744 --> 01:28:14,258
Fall came,

938
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:17,383
Mrs Wajsbrot's delivery
date was approaching.

939
01:28:18,424 --> 01:28:22,976
Wajsbrot's wife was, as they say,
of a frail constitution.

940
01:28:23,584 --> 01:28:26,258
The doctor knew they wouldn't let him go,
but he begged them

941
01:28:26,424 --> 01:28:31,704
to let her come to the jail for a few days
so he could deliver the baby.

942
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:34,858
I read the transcripts,

943
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,465
they're shocking.

944
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:40,700
He spilled some made-up names

945
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:45,065
and promised to expose an international
band of imperialist contacts

946
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:48,303
if they'd only let him deliver the baby.

947
01:28:49,225 --> 01:28:50,864
But they didn't.

948
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:53,616
- And Mrs Wajsbrot died?
- Yes,

949
01:28:53,865 --> 01:28:55,458
though she needn't have.

950
01:28:56,225 --> 01:29:00,618
The neighbors fetched the best
midwife in the district...

951
01:29:01,506 --> 01:29:04,499
As bad luck would have it,
she'd come with her daughter.

952
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:26,101
Zoska!

953
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:31,137
Nooo! Don't leave me!

954
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:49,146
I've got a theory that

955
01:29:49,547 --> 01:29:51,983
evil is the result of gossip.

956
01:29:52,548 --> 01:29:55,188
If the little girl hadn't kept hearing

957
01:29:55,268 --> 01:29:58,944
about those barrels in which the Jews
murder children to make matzos...

958
01:30:00,588 --> 01:30:03,865
They say to this day
you can hear her screaming

959
01:30:04,788 --> 01:30:07,508
and the baby crying on Zamkowa Street.

960
01:30:24,429 --> 01:30:27,706
Wajsbrot hanged himself
next day in his cell.

961
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:30,223
Jerzy Szyller?

962
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:32,859
His father was the KWP major.

963
01:30:34,749 --> 01:30:36,183
Grzegorz Budnik?

964
01:30:36,429 --> 01:30:38,660
Son of the secret police chief.

965
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:41,989
And Mrs Budnik?

966
01:30:42,189 --> 01:30:44,102
Her mother was from Zawichost,

967
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:48,100
born in 1941.

968
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,424
So when the Wajsbrots died, she was six.

969
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:56,386
A little girl who could have
been extremely frightened

970
01:30:56,590 --> 01:31:00,470
when she saw a terrifing barrel
in a ruined Jewish house.

971
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:03,422
And the Wajsbrots' son?

972
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:10,390
You're wrong, Prosecutor.

973
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:23,190
You've got it very wrong.

974
01:31:27,071 --> 01:31:29,451
"Fathers shall not be put to
death for their sons' sins,

975
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:31,831
nor shall sons be put to death
for their fathers' sins.

976
01:31:31,991 --> 01:31:33,903
Each shall die for his own sin. "

977
01:31:34,352 --> 01:31:36,264
"For I, the Lord your God,

978
01:31:36,352 --> 01:31:39,663
am a jealous God, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the sons

979
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:42,227
to the third and fourh generations. "

980
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,985
The same book,

981
01:31:45,432 --> 01:31:47,822
but a few chapters earlier.

982
01:31:48,672 --> 01:31:52,348
But what matters is that you're wrong.

983
01:31:52,752 --> 01:31:54,664
We'll meet tomorrow at your interiew.

984
01:31:57,432 --> 01:31:59,344
What pointless vengeance...

985
01:32:01,513 --> 01:32:03,903
At least be sure to answer
for it all with style.

986
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,465
You don't like me,

987
01:32:08,513 --> 01:32:10,425
and I even know why.

988
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:13,232
Come on...

989
01:33:22,756 --> 01:33:23,826
Excuse me.

990
01:33:24,556 --> 01:33:25,387
Yes?

991
01:33:25,596 --> 01:33:29,749
- I'm looking for the girl who was in here.
- Are you a relative?

992
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:36,994
I'm the prosecutor.

993
01:33:37,596 --> 01:33:39,189
She passed away at daybreak.

994
01:33:42,996 --> 01:33:44,954
I'm sorry.

995
01:34:21,118 --> 01:34:23,838
Hello! Hello!

996
01:34:26,438 --> 01:34:28,589
- MrGasiorowski?
- Who's asking?

997
01:34:28,878 --> 01:34:32,508
The state prosecutor of the Polish Republic,
that's who the fuck's asking! Yes or no?

998
01:34:32,598 --> 01:34:33,827
Darek Gasiorowski.

999
01:34:33,878 --> 01:34:35,916
That pal of yours, the bum.
Was he found?

1000
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,190
- No.
- What's his name?

1001
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:41,709
- Tolo.
- Anatol?

1002
01:34:41,839 --> 01:34:43,398
- Yes.
- Then what?

1003
01:34:46,759 --> 01:34:48,193
Fijewski.

1004
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:50,356
- I can describe him, if you...
- No need.

1005
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:58,191
Passpors

1006
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,511
Good morning.
Ticket and ID card please.

1007
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,353
Thank you.

1008
01:35:29,761 --> 01:35:31,673
Mr Anatol!

1009
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:53,682
Do you know what real love is?

1010
01:35:57,362 --> 01:35:59,752
The kind that means
nothing else matters?

1011
01:36:00,322 --> 01:36:02,154
Not in the least bit?

1012
01:36:05,522 --> 01:36:09,198
Making you capable
of the greatest sacrifices...

1013
01:36:10,602 --> 01:36:12,514
and the greatest crimes?

1014
01:36:15,122 --> 01:36:17,034
Please stick to the facts.

1015
01:36:19,243 --> 01:36:22,122
- Ela and Szyller...
- Please use full names.

1016
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:26,041
My wife Elzbieta Budnik
and Jerzy Szyller... better?

1017
01:36:26,603 --> 01:36:30,358
I wanted to kill my wife
Elzbieta Budnik and Jerzy Szyller.

1018
01:36:30,603 --> 01:36:33,482
I really did.
It gave me pleasure.

1019
01:36:34,123 --> 01:36:38,402
Afer all those months imagining
what they were doing together.

1020
01:36:38,843 --> 01:36:42,314
Afer hearing all those
lies, all those stories

1021
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:45,955
about work meetings with actors.

1022
01:36:46,324 --> 01:36:51,115
You don't know what it's like,
how that hatred grows from day to day,

1023
01:36:51,324 --> 01:36:56,639
every minute, every second,
the whole time I knew

1024
01:36:58,444 --> 01:37:00,356
she wasn't really mine,

1025
01:37:01,284 --> 01:37:04,482
but when she finally told me to my face,

1026
01:37:05,564 --> 01:37:08,875
it was terrible.

1027
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:14,004
I decided that if I couldn't have her,

1028
01:37:15,445 --> 01:37:17,357
nobody was going to have her.

1029
01:37:20,205 --> 01:37:22,037
It won't work.

1030
01:37:23,965 --> 01:37:25,479
I don't understand.

1031
01:37:26,005 --> 01:37:27,485
It has already worked.

1032
01:37:27,565 --> 01:37:29,602
Playing at paragraph four won't work.

1033
01:37:31,765 --> 01:37:34,917
Killing that poor hobo,
making yourself look like him,

1034
01:37:35,205 --> 01:37:38,597
all those theatrical crimes
- that took weeks to prepare.

1035
01:37:39,686 --> 01:37:43,316
That kind of premeditation excludes extreme
agitation justified by the circumstances.

1036
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:45,477
You're wasting my time and this paper.

1037
01:37:52,246 --> 01:37:54,966
- Acting the madman won't work either.
- Why not?

1038
01:37:56,566 --> 01:37:58,956
Because you've put too much
effor into rational activities

1039
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:01,437
aimed at escaping
criminal responsibility.

1040
01:38:01,847 --> 01:38:04,407
You're not a bad player, are you?

1041
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:08,559
I knew killing them would be easy.

1042
01:38:09,727 --> 01:38:12,037
The problem was how to avoid jail.

1043
01:38:12,567 --> 01:38:17,358
Stirring up all that Jewish hysteria could
help, this is Sandomierz after all,

1044
01:38:18,127 --> 01:38:21,438
but I needed to be sure nobody
would be looking for me.

1045
01:38:21,767 --> 01:38:24,726
When it finally struck me that nobody
would be looking for a corpse,

1046
01:38:25,167 --> 01:38:28,240
the rest was just an exercise
in creative thinking.

1047
01:38:28,888 --> 01:38:31,119
I felt sorry for that hobo,

1048
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,606
I really did.

1049
01:38:33,968 --> 01:38:36,244
But I wanted the crime to be perfect.

1050
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:37,808
The ar of illusion.

1051
01:38:37,968 --> 01:38:41,325
You were looking at a marionette.
The barrel, the plaster on the forehead.

1052
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:45,158
So you didn't see the hands
and the strings moving the puppet.

1053
01:38:45,848 --> 01:38:50,206
The formal identification was done by
the one person who didn't know me well.

1054
01:38:50,328 --> 01:38:51,557
I said: full names.

1055
01:38:52,048 --> 01:38:58,000
Prosecutor Teodor Szacki!

1056
01:39:03,329 --> 01:39:05,605
Did you deliberately
incriminate Leon Wilczur?

1057
01:39:06,009 --> 01:39:08,365
That was your initiative too,
Prosecutor.

1058
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,920
Well, let's say I gave you a gentle
push in the right direction.

1059
01:39:12,209 --> 01:39:13,165
I knew who he was,

1060
01:39:13,569 --> 01:39:15,367
my father told me the
truth on his death bed.

1061
01:39:15,409 --> 01:39:20,007
All his life it bothered him that
he hadn't let Wajsbrot out of jail.

1062
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,685
He was afraid of a Jewish curse.

1063
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,728
And when I met Ela,

1064
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:30,208
he was sure it was Wajsbrot, demanding
justice from beyond the grave.

1065
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:32,602
Stupid superstitions?

1066
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,283
Why not admit it?

1067
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:41,163
I came very close
to committing the perect crime.

1068
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:44,202
You people always come very close.

1069
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:06,203
Will you be sad?

1070
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:09,886
I don't know,

1071
01:40:10,412 --> 01:40:12,643
- will you?
- What about you?

1072
01:40:16,652 --> 01:40:18,450
Maybe a little.
I don't know.

1073
01:40:23,452 --> 01:40:26,206
That case had already been closed.
How did it occur to you?

1074
01:40:26,492 --> 01:40:27,846
A grain of truth.

1075
01:40:28,452 --> 01:40:30,205
In every legend there's
a grain of truth?

1076
01:40:30,652 --> 01:40:31,927
There isn't really.

1077
01:40:33,332 --> 01:40:36,565
I realized that this case was just
like the legend of ritual murder

1078
01:40:36,773 --> 01:40:38,924
that everything about it was a lie.

1079
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:40,772
It's all so creepy,

1080
01:40:42,573 --> 01:40:46,362
that those people's fates should have
come together again. As if some dybbuk...

1081
01:40:48,733 --> 01:40:49,883
I don't believe in ghosts.

1082
01:40:54,773 --> 01:40:57,413
There's nothing about them
in the Penal Code.

1083
01:41:00,413 --> 01:41:04,414
