1
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,031
Hi Dad! You're finally home.
How was the hospital?

2
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:33,652
As usual, you know.

3
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,454
Let me rest five minutes,

4
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:41,805
then get your things
and come in the office.

5
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:17,350
No clearly, you haven't understood
the main point.

6
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,546
When one can't figure
the antiderivativa

7
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:21,818
of an integral function,

8
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,310
one uses the integration by parts.
Here, for example.

9
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:30,392
Now…

10
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:37,134
We don't know how to calculate
the antiderivative of xcos(x).

11
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,629
But since we know the product,

12
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,998
we can try the calculation
of the integration by parts.

13
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:50,122
Suppose that u'(x)=cosx and v(x)=x.
Then u(x)=sinx et v'(x)=1. Thus:

14
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:52,681
<i>"Idle Youth
By all things enslaved"</i>

15
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:55,827
<i>Through sensitivity
I've wasted my days.</i>

16
00:05:55,828 --> 00:06:01,483
<i>Let the moment come
When hearts love as one.</i>

17
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,721
<i>I told myself: Wait
And let no one see:</i>

18
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,550
<i>And without the promise
Of true ecstasy.</i>

19
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,497
<i>Let nothing delay
This hiding away.</i>

20
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,923
<i>I've been patient so long</i>

21
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,668
<i>I've forgotten even
The terror and suffering</i>

22
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,139
<i>Flown up to heaven,</i>

23
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,275
<i>A sick thirst again
Darkens my veins.</i>

24
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:23,394
<i>So the meadow Freed by neglect,</i>

25
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:25,340
<i>Flowered, overgrown</i>

26
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,526
<i>With weeds and incense,
To the buzzing nearby</i>

27
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,524
<i>Of a hundred foul flies.</i>

28
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:36,287
<i>Thousand widowhoods
Of a soul so poor</i>

29
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,222
<i>It bears only the image
Of our Lady before!</i>

30
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,011
<i>Does one then pray, Lucille?</i>

31
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,465
<i>To the Virgin today?</i>

32
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:46,560
<i>"Idle Youth
By all things enslaved…" Lucille!</i>

33
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,217
Lucille!

34
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,590
It is 8:05!

35
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,069
Excuse me, I didn't hear.
I was reading.

36
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:11,567
If you wish to read, do so in
the evening, after supper…

37
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:12,804
Yes father.

38
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:15,555
Next time you go without supper
if you insist on arriving late.

39
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:36,977
Such a storm this morning!

40
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,378
The weather is crazy.

41
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:43,894
When I was young it never
rained this time of year.

42
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:48,452
Human beings consume too much.
We're suffocating the planet.

43
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,147
Can they prove it
scientifically, dad?

44
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,068
Yes… naturally…

45
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,208
If you'ld like to learn more, I could get
you an advanced text on meteorology.

46
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,330
For your 18th birthday.

47
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,041
For my birthday?

48
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,285
That would be a good
practical present.

49
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,470
Yes, but…

50
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,590
Practical and educational.

51
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:12,732
A far cry from our
advertising TV culture.

52
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,034
What I'ld really like to do is…
to go to college…

53
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,175
that would be educational…
to study poetry.

54
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:21,991
Poetry?

55
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:25,553
Yeah… Oscar Wilde, Rimbaud,
Baudelaire... and literature too.

56
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,328
What good is studying
literature and poetry?

57
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,430
You can read yourself
and that's sufficient.

58
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,481
Oscar Wilde doesn't deserve
all the attention you give him.

59
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:40,846
The man was a pervert and it's just
as well that he was imprisoned.

60
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,318
And if you'd like
to write poetry

61
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,672
you can do it to your heart's
content right here at home.

62
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,984
But I'd learn more if
I went away to college.

63
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:54,448
Not really… One doesn't learn
as effectively in a group setting.

64
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,632
But since you really don't like
teaching me poetry…

65
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,035
You'd be better off
with the sciences.

66
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,402
You could help me here. Before you
wanted to be a doctor, like me.

67
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:06,876
I've changed my mind.

68
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:15,190
And that's just the problem.
You never stick with anything.

69
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,715
Remember what happened
when you were twelve?

70
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,835
You wanted to go away
to boarding school,

71
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,766
but you were back home
three months later.

72
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,891
You told me that you
couldn't make any friends

73
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:31,449
and that you cried yourself to sleep
each night. Isn't that right?

74
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,397
<i>When your mother was
sick those two long years…</i>

75
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,091
<i>What good is studying
literature and poetry?</i>

76
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,583
<i>… your father asked me …</i>

77
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,672
<i>You can read yourself
and that's sufficient.</i>

78
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:20,949
<i>To come and take care of you…</i>

79
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,939
<i>The man was a pervert and it's just
as well that he was imprisoned.</i>

80
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,398
<i>… but I couldn't come then.</i>

81
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,995
<i>Now, clearly, you haven't understood
the main point.</i>

82
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,344
<i>You'd be better off
with the sciences.</i>

83
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,874
<i>And if you wish to write poetry</i>

84
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,767
<i>you can do it to your heart's
content right here at home.</i>

85
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,662
<i>I hate you! Let me out!</i>

86
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,131
<i>Let me out!</i>

87
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,507
<i>You're all that he has.</i>

88
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,327
Thank you. Goodbye.

89
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,289
<i>I am Lucille's great aunt.</i>

90
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,911
<i>I'm so glad that you've come
to help with her care.</i>

91
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:36,991
<i>Joan Genova. Yes. I'm thankful for
the opportunity to be here.</i>

92
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>I hope it wasn't too hard
to get out here.</i>

93
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:44,937
<i>Oh no no. I managed to find a driver
who knew the way from the main station.</i>

94
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,477
So, you are from Italy?

95
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:50,752
Yes, from Calabria, the mountains.

96
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:54,251
When I was 15 my parents
sent me to my uncle's in Boston.

97
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:56,756
I imagine you must resemble
your mother?

98
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:58,225
Yes.

99
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,207
In our family too, the girls
all resemble their mother.

100
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,975
Let me show you to Arthur's.
I'm sorry, Doctor Baert's office.

101
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:09,244
Thank you.

102
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,567
Come in.

103
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:22,499
Please be seated, Miss Genova.

104
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,501
You are later than we expected you.

105
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,960
Yes, I'm so sorry.

106
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,539
I shall explain the situation.

107
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:36,835
One week ago my daughter
had an accident.

108
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:41,649
She suffered third degree
burns on her face

109
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,365
and tissue loss around
the left cheek and nose.

110
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:47,847
After first making an incision,

111
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:50,985
I treated the most serious wounds
with a series of allografts

112
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,438
through which I have avoided any serious
hydro-electrical complications.

113
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,604
She shows no respiratory
complications, but

114
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:05,875
you must nonetheless observe closely
to forestall any hypermetabolisation,

115
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:11,372
guard against infection, and help
her maintain nutritional levels.

116
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:16,279
I would like her watched
twenty-four hours day.

117
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,917
I shall remain with her as much
as is necessary.

118
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:26,588
In this house I do not wish to hear
any mention of the hospital.

119
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,679
Yes, of course.

120
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:36,275
I will show you to your room.

121
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,134
Those are Italian shoes, right?

122
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:41,980
Yes.

123
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,496
Very good.

"Pharmaceutical Formulary for
Surgeons and Nurses."

125
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:17,319
Lucille, your nurse has arrived.

126
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:18,864
Come in.

127
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,092
Good morning, Lucille.

128
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:31,313
She remains in a state of shock.

129
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,902
Mutism and paralysis
of the extremities.

130
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,578
Bandages, compresses, disinfection,
sodium chloride solution

131
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,838
cortisone, everything
you need is right here.

132
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,636
Very good.

133
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:49,572
You will give her six of these
and two capsules four times a day.

134
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,314
I must leave now.

135
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,697
I'll be back at 6:30 sharp if
I have no emergencies.

Lucille has not had any problems?

138
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:15,294
She refused to eat.

139
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:18,544
You may leave us now.

140
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:37,329
Lucille, my dear… you know
that today is your birthday…

141
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,076
I'll heal you quickly,

142
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:43,155
I promise you.

143
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:45,840
Just look at your present.

144
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:07,371
Your mother made me promise that I give
them to you on your 18th birthday.

145
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,342
I keep them for you… just for now…

146
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:16,097
Soon everything will be
just as it was.

147
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:18,491
I'm sure of it…

148
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:04,695
Is something hurting?

149
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,852
That itches… Is that it?

150
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:21,637
That doesn't itch anymore…

151
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:22,939
look at me…

152
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,433
Breath deeply now…

159
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,143
Masseter:

160
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:30,176
28. Got it?

161
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,486
You will apply this cream
twice a day.

162
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,846
It will regenerate the tissue
underneath the bandage.

163
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,549
Really now, be careful!

164
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:21,347
Always the same scarring.

165
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:24,052
Look at this.

166
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:29,063
These idiots. Incompetents!

167
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,317
Lucille will have no scars…
not like Anna.

168
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,919
It began with a tissue sample,
followed by an ablation.

169
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,368
They were never sure of
anything so they cut.

170
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,121
In the end, they gave her back
to me covered with scars

171
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:46,053
without ever having healed her.

172
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:48,667
My poor Arthur…

173
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:51,817
I should have kept her at home.

174
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:55,618
You would have taken
good care of her.

175
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,914
She has developed a strong fever.

176
00:32:56,385 --> 00:33:01,278
I'll be back. Above all, don't put this
one back in the cage with the others

177
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:12,056
Poor Lucille, I should make her
one of her favorite dinners.

178
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,802
Here, give her this injection.

179
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:06,510
Above all, keep an eye
on her breathing.

180
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:44,725
Grandma… are you sure this
is really what you want?

181
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,377
I can't possibly take it from you.

182
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:09,424
But she really wants you to have it.

183
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:45,741
Let me go!

184
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,376
A pervert…

185
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,888
imprisoned…

186
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,791
you can't make friends...

187
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,678
idiot…

188
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,336
it's fearful outside...

189
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:11,112
he's right… yes, you see…
I can't … nothing nothing nothing

190
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:16,759
I'd rather die…
I'm better off dead.

191
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:45,709
Here, take this book on
reconstructive plastic surgery.

192
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,342
It's incomplete, of course…

193
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:48,670
Thank you.

194
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:53,405
Like all the other books, they haven't
included my new research so

195
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,997
they're a bit outdated…

196
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:57,621
Yes… I'm sure.

197
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:03,249
I'm thinking that you must
be up to date… Lucille…

198
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,020
Yes …that is, how so?

199
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,089
Because of her attempted suicide.

200
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,100
You have too much imagination!

201
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:16,868
I know that it can't be easy for
a father to understand…

202
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:17,794
Foolishness!

203
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:18,968
But she's the one who told me…

204
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:19,917
Enough!

205
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:21,157
How can you be so…

206
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:25,176
That will do! I do not require a lecture
from you… Do I make myself clear?

207
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,362
Yes.

208
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,648
No…

209
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,959
No no no!

210
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:08,076
I have no more use for you!

211
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:14,237
You slow me down more
than you help me.

212
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:48,384
Here, take a sip.

213
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:51,069
Thank you.

214
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:00,613
Feel better?

215
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,868
It was one thing we didn't need…

216
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:10,357
Dear God, help us!

217
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:13,974
Above all, you have to take
care of yourself.

218
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,472
Your pulse is low.

219
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:29,251
If that continues you have to talk
to Lucille's father…

220
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:34,768
anyway, you can get him
to listen to you.

221
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:39,942
And I never saw it coming …
My God!

222
00:39:40,865 --> 00:39:43,760
You have to promise not to worry
yourself for Lucille.

223
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:47,008
What happened was in the
past. I'm here to help her now.

224
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:53,199
Yes, but poor Arthur…
You must not hold it against him.

225
00:39:53,777 --> 00:39:55,866
I never expected that reaction.

226
00:39:55,867 --> 00:40:01,694
He adores his daughter. He doesn't
want to see any harm come to her.

227
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:03,231
Yes, I never doubted that…

228
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,968
And Lucille is the same as him.

229
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:09,926
She can't forgive herself
for causing him pain.

230
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:22,088
Will you be OK?

231
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,717
Yes.

232
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,686
I'm going to go and comfort her.

233
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:52,639
No. This is my job; I'm the one
who should be doing it.

234
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,112
And besides that…
it's not good for you.

235
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,000
What is this ointment made from?

236
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:11,680
Growth proteins. Antihistamines as well.

237
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:13,683
It makes it easier for the graft to take

238
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,171
by accelerating the uniform
budding of the skin.

239
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,866
Come see! I'll explain it to you.

240
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,232
What you see here is much more than a

241
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:36,040
simple culture of keratinocytes
on a bed of fibroblasts.

242
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,404
You will find all the different
strata of the skin:

243
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,948
The epidermis here,

244
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,708
the basal layer of course,

245
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:48,205
collagen that attaches the epidermis
to the dermis, as you know,

246
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,226
melanocytes

247
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:53,898
and above all the different
proteins and cells.

248
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:57,983
Why not use the skin you've taken
from other parts of her body?

249
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:02,145
To end up with a leopard's skin,
blemishes and scars everywhere?

250
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:05,164
You've seen the terrible results
they end up with at the hospital.

251
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:07,122
Yes, unfortunately.

252
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:11,181
I've uncovered all the
properties of the skin...

253
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:15,072
Resilience, flexibility,
regeneration.

254
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:20,452
The sensitivity to touch, pigmentation,
nutrition. It's all there.

255
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:23,157
Perfectly reconstituted skin.

256
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:25,788
Very impressive!

257
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:27,424
Tomorrow will be our day.

258
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:32,121
Sleep well tonight.

259
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,100
Are you alright?

260
00:48:43,857 --> 00:48:45,350
You think you can stand?

261
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:46,812
My legs are weak.

262
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:53,913
"Quercetin/Nettle Plus."

263
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,273
Please, do it like you did yesterday.

264
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:36,041
You may leave us.

265
00:50:41,524 --> 00:50:42,544
No, stay.

266
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,309
Help her to sit on the edge please.

267
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:52,051
70 by 110. A little bit low.

268
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:09,459
You will give her these in
addition to the others.

269
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,532
She needs to regain muscle mass.

270
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:15,888
Surely there are other ways
than the medication…

271
00:52:15,964 --> 00:52:18,361
She is getting enough
nourishment now.

272
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,956
Yeah, I can't stand
swallowing these pills.

273
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,859
Very well… Since you're
doing so much better

274
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,090
I'm sure you can do without them.

275
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:13,268
Any more problems with
the pulse rate?

276
00:53:17,984 --> 00:53:22,948
I'm sorry. I got a little bit
carried away before…

277
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,760
Only three minutes left…

278
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:26,436
Are you baking a cake?

279
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,401
In the kitchen at
least I'm still useful.

280
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:33,581
Well, I don't know how they got by
around here before you came.

281
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:38,793
Poor things… frozen dinners
and canned food…

282
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:42,127
They would never survive without you.

283
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:46,540
I'm old now… tired…

284
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:51,075
I'd like to be with Jan.

285
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:55,354
It's time that he calls
me back to him.

286
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:57,046
No no, don't say that...

287
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:04,654
That smells good…

288
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:35,863
Here, for Lucille.

289
00:54:37,492 --> 00:54:40,589
No. You go and surprise her.

290
00:56:34,147 --> 00:56:39,007
Mussels! I missed them
so much. Do you like it?

291
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,824
It smells delicious.

292
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,850
I have to learn how to cook so
I can make them myself.

293
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:47,472
I'll show you.

294
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:49,902
That might come in handy.

295
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:55,645
Dad, when will you take off
the last bandages?

296
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,007
In three days,

297
00:56:57,008 --> 00:57:00,352
I've got to check the results and
reduce the bandage once more.

298
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:04,322
In one more week you will feel
the fresh air on your face.

299
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:08,202
And you'll be finally able
to see what I look like.

300
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:10,118
I can imagine.

301
00:57:13,775 --> 00:57:16,347
You will have some micro-scars,

302
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,053
they'll only be noticeable to the touch

303
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:22,600
and they will be all but
indistinguishable before you know it.

304
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:26,287
You're the best, Dad.
I knew you'ld succeed.

305
00:58:40,196 --> 00:58:43,526
I didn't know what to do with myself,
you know, before you came.

306
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:53,829
I mean I felt so alone. I never got
to see anybody else. Just him and her.

307
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,291
I'm really glad that you're here.

308
00:59:29,229 --> 00:59:31,742
I think Parker has
learned his lesson...

309
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:34,979
after what happened
to him this time.

310
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:36,719
What happened to him?

311
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,470
Accident in the car.

312
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:40,244
A bad one.

313
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:41,847
He was drunk!

314
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:45,602
He barely got out alive…

315
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,302
so many broken bones

316
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:52,659
but he hung on to life

317
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:56,018
and he rediscovered his faith.

318
00:59:56,897 --> 01:00:00,345
And all the carrying on with the
married women, it's all over?

319
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:04,627
Yes, he realized he was
on the slippery slope…

320
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,869
Too bad.

321
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,053
Don't you think he was sexier before?

322
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:10,918
No...

323
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:13,496
now it's Betty who has the problems.

324
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:20,448
Well anyway, it's their lives and
they should do what they want.

325
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:35,317
Where is Joan?

326
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:36,961
She's in the lab.

327
01:00:36,962 --> 01:00:39,558
I thought you'd hired her
to take care of me.

328
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:43,645
Since you don't need her anymore
she's going to help me.

329
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,705
It's just like with the other baby-sitters.

330
01:00:45,706 --> 01:00:48,382
Each year you found a new one and
they were never good enough for you.

331
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,967
Stop it.

332
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:52,275
I need her as an assistant.

333
01:02:32,464 --> 01:02:35,117
Lucille! Lucille!

334
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:37,818
Oh God, are you alright?

335
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:40,029
Hold on me.

336
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,762
It will all have to be removed.
It was not irrigated.

337
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:29,024
But she still can be healed?

338
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,870
Of course… but I need
living skin this time.

339
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:10,993
<i>It will all have to be removed.
It was not irrigated…</i>

340
01:11:10,994 --> 01:11:12,591
<i>But she still can be healed?</i>

341
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,021
<i>Of course… but I need
living skin this time.</i>

342
01:12:26,105 --> 01:12:27,524
I want to stay like this forever.

343
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:28,878
I know…

344
01:13:20,169 --> 01:13:21,766
Your skin is so soft,

345
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:24,058
so sweet…

346
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:27,667
You smell so good…

347
01:13:30,598 --> 01:13:34,245
your skin melts
in the mouth like chocolate.

348
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,712
Your face

349
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:42,038
should be in a Michelangelo,
or something.

350
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:50,825
I can't believe how soft
and white your breasts are…

351
01:13:51,425 --> 01:13:53,306
Such compliments,

352
01:13:53,947 --> 01:13:55,797
you'll spoil me…

353
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:58,388
I want to know everything about you.

354
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:02,064
There's not so much to know.

355
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:05,024
Well, like…

356
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:08,630
Have you ever been in love before?

357
01:14:10,242 --> 01:14:13,872
Yes, once…

358
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:17,165
Who was it?

359
01:14:20,408 --> 01:14:23,968
A schoolmate, in Italy.

360
01:14:33,374 --> 01:14:36,223
And did you let her
touch you like that?

361
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,867
No...

362
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,506
never like that.

363
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:47,047
Was it better than with me?

364
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,210
No...

365
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:54,727
No… never this intense.

366
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:58,735
And...

367
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:06,787
were you together a long time?

368
01:15:06,788 --> 01:15:10,576
Until my mother caught us…

369
01:15:10,577 --> 01:15:11,869
What?

370
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:17,404
She sent me away, to Boston.

371
01:15:19,202 --> 01:15:24,492
She separated you from your love?
So mean!

372
01:15:29,402 --> 01:15:33,546
She never told
anyone about this.

373
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:35,302
She was too ashamed.

374
01:15:35,303 --> 01:15:38,863
She banished me like
I had the plague.

375
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:46,864
So she made up an excuse that I was
going to marry my cousin, in Boston.

376
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:55,278
Did you marry him?

377
01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:59,027
Of course not.

378
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,349
I refused.

379
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:08,844
After?

380
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:11,307
Nothing…

381
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:14,674
you.

382
01:16:19,844 --> 01:16:21,551
You were waiting for me?

383
01:16:21,552 --> 01:16:25,016
Yes, I was waiting

384
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:27,188
for you.

385
01:16:53,629 --> 01:16:55,220
Me too,

386
01:16:58,194 --> 01:17:00,030
I was waiting for you.

387
01:17:17,164 --> 01:17:19,019
I have never been in love for real.

388
01:17:27,249 --> 01:17:31,786
The girls in my age, one or two
I met, they all seemed so stupid.

389
01:17:33,964 --> 01:17:37,986
Maybe you didn't meet a lot of them…

390
01:17:40,169 --> 01:17:41,924
I like older women.

391
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,029
That means if I were younger,

392
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:52,425
you wouldn't have fallen
in love with me?

393
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:57,309
Yes, I would have…

394
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:04,401
as soon as I saw you,
I fell in love with you.

395
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:38,507
<i>"And then by common accord"</i>

396
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,968
<i>they glide towards each other
underwater.</i>

397
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:44,736
<i>The female shark using its fins,</i>

398
01:18:44,737 --> 01:18:48,761
<i>and Maldoror cleaving the waves
with his arms;</i>

399
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:52,358
<i>And they hold their breath
in deep veneration,</i>

400
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,709
<i>each one wishing to gaze for the first
time upon the other, his living portrait.”</i>

401
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,776
You should show me some
of your poems.

402
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:05,602
Do you really want to see them?

403
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:07,930
Yes. Of course.

404
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:11,430
I might want to.

405
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:16,307
Later, after my face is healed,
and we're far away from here.

406
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,999
How do you feel?

407
01:21:13,885 --> 01:21:16,960
Still tired... and you?

408
01:21:17,241 --> 01:21:21,365
I feel fine.
Dad says I'm recovering fast.

409
01:21:21,716 --> 01:21:23,597
Good.

410
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:29,135
It's always taken me a long time
to heal from anything.

411
01:21:42,896 --> 01:21:44,187
<i>The Guiding Light.</i>

412
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:48,560
<i>Presented by Dash. The soap that does
everything in your washing machine.</i>

413
01:21:48,568 --> 01:21:51,839
<i>And Ivory soap.
The most famous soap in the world.</i>

414
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,711
<i>Looking from left to right,</i>

415
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:01,352
<i>Harriet and Gwendolyn.</i>

416
01:22:01,853 --> 01:22:05,144
<i>Don't you think Harriet has an
outstanding complexion?</i>

417
01:22:05,145 --> 01:22:07,945
<i>Well, Ivory is her beauty soap.</i>

418
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:10,224
<i>Now, don't be hurt Gwendolyn.</i>

419
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,395
<i>You can have that ivory
look yourself…</i>

420
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,740
And now a little snack!

421
01:22:34,982 --> 01:22:36,814
Something's got you worried.

422
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,519
Pretty soon your father's going
to ask me to leave.

423
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,921
But we will leave together
as soon as you're better.

424
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,760
'Cause I might be jealous if you
touch somebody else!

425
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:33,821
Dad! Come quick!

426
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:50,327
Are you in pain?

427
01:23:52,705 --> 01:23:54,058
I saw them…

428
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:11,170
I hate you! Let me out!

429
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:13,289
Let me out!

430
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:19,904
Miss Genova,

431
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,098
If you'ld like, I have a job for you.

432
01:24:23,697 --> 01:24:26,763
You must help me... my daughter
needs a private nurse…

433
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:28,615
I don't want to admit her
to the hospital…

434
01:24:28,616 --> 01:24:31,665
I can't take anymore…
I don't have any spare time.

435
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,934
Listen,

436
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,335
you must be careful.

437
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:42,218
Some colleagues are already suspicious
of what has happened with your patients.

438
01:24:42,284 --> 01:24:43,568
So...

439
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:47,929
you better leave before
they find out.

440
01:24:53,941 --> 01:24:56,082
You must never do that again.

441
01:24:58,299 --> 01:25:00,338
I could crush you like a worm.

442
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:02,152
Just let her leave.

443
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,612
It will be the best for everyone.

444
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:07,745
It is you who are going to leave,
and right away…

445
01:25:07,746 --> 01:25:11,109
and don't think about working in
any hospital of this country…

446
01:25:11,687 --> 01:25:14,003
I'll scour each and every
personnel department,

447
01:25:14,004 --> 01:25:16,905
and I'll see to it that you are
cut out like a cancer!

448
01:25:17,602 --> 01:25:20,104
And you, doctor,

449
01:25:20,105 --> 01:25:22,556
did you have the approval
of the families

450
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:26,028
before taking off the
precious skin grafts?

451
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,866
Who would believe you?

452
01:25:37,164 --> 01:25:38,940
On the other hand,

453
01:25:38,941 --> 01:25:41,707
I've taken the trouble of keeping an
autopsy report

454
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:44,086
of each patient you euthanized.

455
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:48,896
I have all the proof and need only
call the police.

456
01:26:02,344 --> 01:26:03,351
Hello.

457
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:10,747
Yes, please send a taxi out here to me
to Rockhill, The Baert Estate. Thank.

458
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:36,555
What did she mean with that
story about skin grafts?

459
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:38,945
Nothing.

460
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:41,746
You have taken the skin of the dead!?

461
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:47,852
What is it, you want it to be like
with Anna, that we lose Lucille, too?

462
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:07,928
Give me that.

463
01:27:08,775 --> 01:27:11,643
Now all we need is for you
to break a leg.

464
01:27:14,673 --> 01:27:16,228
Just take it easy.

465
01:27:32,605 --> 01:27:33,813
Lucille,

466
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:36,424
Lucille it's me.

467
01:27:37,192 --> 01:27:38,973
All this will pass.

468
01:27:45,443 --> 01:27:47,820
Pretty soon you won't
resent me anymore.

469
01:27:49,313 --> 01:27:50,728
Lucille?

470
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,937
Lucille, do you hear me?

471
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,806
Give me the key!

472
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:15,254
No.

473
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:17,239
Ingrid, please, give me the key!

474
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,240
No.

475
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:19,777
Give me the key!

476
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,679
Now give me that key!

477
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:11,908
<i>This time, I saw Woman in the city,</i>

478
01:29:11,909 --> 01:29:15,352
<i>and I spoke to her,
and she spoke to me.</i>

479
01:29:15,353 --> 01:29:17,656
<i>I was in the bedroom,
