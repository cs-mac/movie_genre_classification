1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,231
What city, please?

2
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,665
Yo, is this Information?
I want information.

3
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,270
For what city, please?

4
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:43,772
I'm in Hollywood and I want to report a
murder. What number do I have to call?

5
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,175
- One moment please.
- Alright, cool.

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,813
- Thank you for calling.
- You're welcome.

7
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,645
The Los Angeles police
emergency number is...

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,813
- Can't you connect me?
- 911.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,857
911? Can't you connect me?

10
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,949
Once again, the number is...

11
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,257
- Sweat, sweat.
- 911.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,625
Oh, man. Damn.

13
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,935
Fuck! Where's my fucking quarter,
you piece-of-shit machine? Damn.

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,466
I got to call them again.

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,475
I should be home, like, watching
The Flintstones, or some shit.

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,503
You have reached the City of Los Angeles
Police Emergency Dispatch Center.

17
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,141
All our lines are busy. Do not hang up.

18
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,414
An operator will answer your call
in the order it's received.

19
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,476
Okay, yeah. I'm first.

20
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,818
What the fuck is this shit, man?

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,092
Yo, I don't speak no Spanish.

22
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,762
Que pasa to you, too, Lupe, and I'd like
to speak to somebody else.

23
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,494
You have reached the City of Los Angeles
Police Emergency Dispatch Center.

24
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,971
This is a tape. This is like a computer,
right?

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,003
Hello? Fuck you!

26
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:54,279
Why am I even doing this shit? I can't
afford it. I'm down to my last quarter.

27
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,939
Let me try the damn operator. Maybe
she knows what's going on.

28
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,177
Operator.

29
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:03,916
Yeah, listen. I'm trying to report a
murder and I can't get no one.

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,890
Have you tried calling the police?

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,554
I got no more money. I'm down
to my stolen credit cards.

32
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,119
Can I use them?

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,398
One moment. I'll connect you.

34
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,899
What do you got?

35
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,774
On the Black Cat, not much. I'm not
getting any help. No leads yet.

36
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,575
What do you mean, no leads? You got
the crime and the F.I. Reports?

37
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,082
<i>At approximately 11:30 p.m.
Thursday, March 19...</i>

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,518
<i>the Black Cat bar on Sunset and Vendome
was held up by two male Mexicans.</i>

39
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,113
<i>They wore silk stockings to disguise their
faces, carried large revolvers.</i>

40
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,681
How do you know they were Mexicans?

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,784
- They spoke with Mexican accents.
- To each other?

42
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,328
- I didn't ask.
- There's your first lead.

43
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,126
<i>Questioned two white males outside
residency, 2269 Tracy Street.</i>

44
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,100
<i>They were drinking vodka and sitting
on top of a late model Camaro...</i>

45
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,158
<i>license, blah, blah, blah.</i>

46
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,033
These go to Bunko, not Robbery, Homicide.

47
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,903
<i>Explained the car was not theirs but
that they lived in the house.</i>

48
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,100
<i>Partner and I searched them, clean.</i>

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,110
<i>Got hot call before we could
run warrant check.</i>

50
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,805
Check these files, Lieutenant.
Sorry about that.

51
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,937
You know, it's really a shame...

52
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,812
when I know a neighborhood better than
the beat cops who patrol it.

53
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,114
When I was a kid, 2269 Tracy Street
was a halfway house for ex-cons.

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,552
We used to call it <i>Gangster Manor.</i>

55
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,747
It's been abandoned for years...

56
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,050
and this guy says he lives there?

57
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,115
There's your second lead, alright?

58
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,325
I was gonna hit this place in Hollywood
until I seen what was inside.

59
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,926
Heavy shit went down in there, man. Like
something out of a Peckinpah movie.

60
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,399
You better send some cops right away to
Aloha Regency, Apartment B.

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,731
You got some heavy shit
on your hands, man.

62
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,538
Are you presently at the scene
of the crime?

63
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,171
This is Sergeant Hopkins.
I want that call on 2-5.

64
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,280
Scotty, that one's mine.

65
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,818
You're gonna go to the Black Cat bar,
you're gonna check with the bartender,

66
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,615
see if those guys spoke Spanish,
alright?

67
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,054
- Not English with Mexican accents. Spanish.
- Spanish.

68
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,889
Okay. Go to 2269 Tracy, see
what you can find there.

69
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,293
Run to the DMV, run a check
on the Camaro...

70
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,991
check with R&I, see if you can find out
anything about the owner.

71
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,055
- You like it?
- I like it.

72
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,760
- Then why are you still standing here?
- Right.

73
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,166
You back again?

74
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,298
This guy's back again. He's running
a scholarship.

75
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,101
Fuck!

76
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,357
Jesus Christ.

77
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,725
Dutch, it's Lloyd.

78
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:20,459
I got a 187 at 7251 De Longpre,
Apartment B.

79
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,232
I need S.I.D., the coroner, and
the on-call homicide team.

80
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,234
Dutch, I know this is Hollywood,
but I want this one.

81
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,675
Dutch, can you clear it for me?

82
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,073
Thanks.

83
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,237
I'll call you later.

84
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,638
Bingo.

85
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,690
You up, Penguin?

86
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,260
Come in, Daddy.

87
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,334
Hi, sweetheart.

88
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,842
Give me five.

89
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,307
On the side.

90
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,778
- Cut the pickle. You owe me a nickel.
- You owe me a nickel.

91
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,683
You had a bad day, didn't you?

92
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,381
How can you tell?

93
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,683
You always shake, just a little.

94
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,183
I'm sorry, Penguin.

95
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,861
It's a shit storm out there.
You know that, don't you?

96
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,987
Yeah.

97
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,998
And you know you gotta
develop claws to fight it.

98
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,500
- Sharp ones, Daddy.
- Attagirl.

99
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,995
Daddy, you owe me.

100
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,392
Do I?

101
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,666
- Yes, you do.
- I don't think so.

102
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,540
Please. It doesn't have to be a long one,
just good.

103
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,938
Just good?

104
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,445
You ready?

105
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,877
Once upon a time, about a year,
a year and a half ago...

106
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,858
Daddy had just cleared the
Haverhill-Jenkins homicide case,
you remember?

107
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,661
Right after, I got assigned
to a robbery deployment,

108
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,630
a loan-out to the West L.A. Squad room
because there had been a series...

109
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,498
of nighttime burglaries at doctors' offices
in large buildings in the Westwood area.

110
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,663
Cash and saleable drugs
were the burglar's meat.

111
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,306
Now, this guy had ripped off about
$5,000 in cash...

112
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,038
and a shitload of pharmaceutical speed
and heavyweight downers...

113
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,602
in less than a month.

114
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,376
The West L.A. Dicks had his M.O.
Figured this way:

115
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,782
This bastard used to hide out
in the building all day long until
nightfall...

116
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,212
he'd hit his mark...

117
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,313
and then he'd run into a
second-story office...

118
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,655
and jump out the window into the parking
lot, if you can believe that.

119
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,387
But there was evidence to point to this.

120
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,361
Chipped cement on window ledges.

121
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,695
The dicks had figured this guy
for, like, a gymnast.

122
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,668
Some bullshit cat-burglar type who could
jump two stories without getting hurt.

123
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,170
They were so sure of it...

124
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,675
that the commander of the squad was
setting up parking lot surveillances.

125
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,677
When this guy hit a doctor's office
right on Wilshire Boulevard...

126
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,307
that two, not one, two teams of detectives
were staking out...

127
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,110
that threw this commander's thesis
all to hell...

128
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,953
and Daddy was called in to save the day.

129
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,149
Tell me how you got the scumbag, Daddy.

130
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,353
Sweetheart, nobody jumps two stories
repeatedly without getting hurt.

131
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,191
So, I formed my own thesis.

132
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,595
This guy was just brazenly walking
out of the building.

133
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,190
Okay, that's enough. No more stories.

134
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,361
Kiss your daddy good night
and get to sleep.

135
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,705
Your mommy's right. It's late.
I'll finish it tomorrow.

136
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,934
It's okay. I know how it ends.

137
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,108
This is the one that ends with the queen
who did full drag B and E, isn't it?

138
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,516
You little bugger, you knew all along,
and you let me tell the story.

139
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,617
Three to five, no parole.

140
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,022
I love you, sweetheart.

141
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,755
I love you, too, Daddy. Thanks.

142
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,129
Good night.

143
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,801
Snuggle in. Snuggle.

144
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,912
She's really something,
that little Penguin.

145
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,277
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to that child?

146
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,823
Here we go again. Daddy's
gonna catch hell.

147
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,122
Daddy? You call spilling out all that
filth and violence being a father?

148
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,218
Do you, Lloyd?

149
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,025
Jen, what do you want me to do?

150
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,231
You want me to tell her about
the Three Bears? Is that it?

151
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,768
She's just a little girl.

152
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,372
An 8-year-old little girl. Can't you
get that through your head?

153
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,609
Let me tell you something you should get
through your head.

154
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,976
They're all little girls, Jen.

155
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,105
Every one of them.

156
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:53,049
Every one of those pathetic souls who
eventually does herself in is a little girl.

157
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,909
Every neurotic who lies on a couch...

158
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,650
and pays some asshole shrink
good money to listen to her bullshit
is a little girl.

159
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,851
Every hooker out hustling her ass
for a pimp...

160
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,329
who winds up with a dyke,
a habit, or wasted by some
psychopath, is a little girl.

161
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,661
All these little girls have
one thing in common.

162
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,894
You know what that is? Disillusionment.

163
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,065
It always comes from the same thing,
expectations.

164
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,368
The greatest woman-killer of all time.

165
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,377
A terminal disease that starts way back
when they're all just little girls.

166
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,345
When they're being fed all the bullshit...

167
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,643
about being entitled to happiness
like it's a birthright.

168
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,944
That's what you don't understand...

169
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,418
when to stop perpetrating the myths
that ruin their lives.

170
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,180
Innocence kills, Jen. Believe me.
It kills.

171
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,918
I see it every fucking day of my life.

172
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,127
Lloyd, I think you're a very sick man...

173
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,996
- Jesus.
- In need of some real help.

174
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,069
Christ, is that the best
you can come up with?

175
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,264
Can't you see that she's got to know
before it's too late?

176
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,001
Know what, Lloyd? What does
she have to know?

177
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,100
What chance has she got?

178
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,112
Her mother still believes in white knights
and happy endings.

179
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,445
I think I'm going to go check on Penny.

180
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,547
Then I think I'd like to sleep alone.

181
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,020
What else is new?

182
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,425
Hello?

183
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,125
Yeah.

184
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,460
Yeah, go.

185
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,976
That's great. No, you get some sleep.
I'll take it from here.

186
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,378
Gibbs? Good work, kid.

187
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,382
Dutch? What're you doing?

188
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,361
Come on, man, you can sleep anytime.

189
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,026
How would you like to take a couple of
armed robbers?

190
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,059
Yeah, by ourselves. What's the problem?
We've done it 100 times.

191
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,932
A stakeout. The guy's pad.

192
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,941
I got the address. I'll pick you up
in half an hour.

193
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,101
Great.

194
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,907
Okay. Bye.

195
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,791
No car, no Wilson.

196
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,495
I got a peek in the back.

197
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,063
Looks like the fucking House of Stereo in
there. It's like an electronics emporium.

198
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,075
- You look happy, kid.
- You're goddamn right. You?

199
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,708
If you are.

200
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,280
It's like old times. Same old thermos.
Same bad coffee.

201
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,184
How are things at home, Lloyd?

202
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,117
I tell you I'm happy, and then
you bring that up. Why?

203
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,416
Jen?

204
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,753
Why can't they fly, Dutch?

205
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,954
- Why can't they fucking fly like us?
- No wings, kid. It's the way they're made.

206
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,261
Nothing they do on their own
is much fun for them.

207
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,325
Without a guy, it's all a waste of time.

208
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,202
And if you don't mind a little advice from
your Dutch uncle, don't try to change it.

209
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,299
That's fucking pathetic.
There's no way Penny's gonna be like that.

210
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,277
She's gonna fly, Dutch. The wings are
there and they're real big ones.

211
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,780
You better hope the tits are there
and they're real big ones.

212
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,316
In this world, she'll get a lot further
with a pair of those.

213
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,045
Jesus, you're as bad...

214
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,619
It's him. It's a Camaro. It's gotta be him.

215
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,520
- Two in the front?
- I don't know.

216
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,029
No, there's two, & they're not getting
out. Come on, let's take them.

217
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,399
- Want to be the drunk?
- I'll be the drunk.

218
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,038
Okay, I'll get you home tonight.
You doing alright?

219
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,370
Yeah.

220
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,972
Gotta lay off those Singapore Slings.
That's your problem.

221
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,849
Hope my wife isn't mad at me.

222
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,080
I'll tell your wife you were out bowling,
alright?

223
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,143
Just tell her we were bowling.

224
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,058
- Let me take the driver.
- You got it.

225
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,991
- Set?
- Now.

226
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,293
Police! Don't move or you're dead.
Put your hands on the dashboard.

227
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,266
You, too, sweetheart. Get them
on the dashboard.

228
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,962
What the hell's going on?
Are you guys crazy?

229
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,471
Where's your Mexican accent, pal?
You only use it in bars?

230
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,268
I'm gonna open this door real slow...

231
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,901
and you're gonna get out real slow.
You got that?

232
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,707
- I got it, cop.
- Okay, move.

233
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,487
- Hey! What the hell's going on out there?
- Jesus Christ.

234
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,486
Dutch, you alright?

235
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,120
Get this piece of shit off you. Take it
easy. You've been hit? Were you hit?

236
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,756
Damn it. How did this happen?
You alright?

237
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:40,100
I must be getting old. Fell for that one.
Knocked the wind right out of me.

238
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,399
- You okay, then?
- Yeah.

239
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,963
Stay right here.

240
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,366
You can get out now.

241
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,274
It's okay. It's all over.

242
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,779
Is what's-his-name dead?

243
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,720
What's-his-name? You don't know his name?

244
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,489
I just met him tonight, I'm a little bad
with names.

245
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,323
Well, I'm pretty good with them.
What's yours?

246
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,121
Sarah Smith.

247
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,430
Sarah, the bad news is what's-his-name
over there is expired.

248
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,002
The good news is...

249
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,029
if you go in that Ford and wait just a
few minutes, I could drive you home.

250
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,433
You mean, and I won't be involved
with any of this?

251
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,478
Like it never happened. Okay?

252
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,277
- Okay.
- Okay.

253
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,415
This will help at the shooting board.

254
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,650
Dutch, you tired?

255
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,789
I'm okay. Why?

256
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,454
I thought maybe you could stick around
and handle the details.

257
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,690
I'll call for the ambulance
and backup units...

258
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,733
in case some of the neighbors
get freaked out.

259
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,270
You see what I mean about big tits?

260
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,067
Come on, Dutch. You blow away
a broad's date...

261
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,802
the least you can do is
drive her home, right?

262
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,037
Thanks.

263
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,115
I remember her. She's the one
who was in here.

264
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,324
I don't think there's any doubt about it.
She came in about a week ago...

265
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,328
- and took out this ad.
- You're absolutely sure?

266
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,490
I'm as sure as one can be. These
are pretty small pictures.

267
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,558
But I remember she came in
with a pretty blonde.

268
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,401
Did you get her name?

269
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,635
No, she just waited over there.
About 35, kind of tall...

270
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,465
real good-looking.

271
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,110
Thank you.

272
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,559
Excuse me, Miss. Police officer.

273
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,125
Christ. Vice?

274
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,603
No, Homicide. It's about Julia Niemeyer.

275
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,472
That's a relief. Actually, I was thinking
about calling you guys.

276
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,107
Why didn't you?

277
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,209
You know, I just didn't know what to say.

278
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,805
- Why? Did you kill her?
- Of course not.

279
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:42,013
But I make it a policy not
to talk to police. They ask
too many questions.

280
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,918
Well, we're gonna have to break policy
this time.

281
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,187
- What's your name?
- Joanie Pratt, age 35...

282
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,851
former actress, model, singer, dancer,
and what usually follows.

283
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,329
What do you do now?

284
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,362
- What usually follows.
- Which is?

285
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,600
- Isn't there someplace else we could talk?
- What's wrong with here?

286
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,630
I'm trying to spare you the police station.
So, please tell me, what do you do now?

287
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,968
It's illegal.

288
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,036
Lady, if it has nothing to do with
this murder, I couldn't care less.

289
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,680
I deal Quaaludes and I fuck selected older
men who don't want to get involved.

290
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,315
I think you're right. Maybe we should go
someplace else and talk.

291
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,787
I thought the papers said she was
found dead, presumably...

292
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,454
strangled by a burglar who panicked.

293
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,830
No, it was a story we gave out to the media
to keep them disinterested. So far, so good.

294
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,529
What I need from you is to tell me
all you can about Julia...

295
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,469
including what these sex ads were about.

296
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,337
Look, there was nothing wrong or illegal
in anything that we...

297
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,812
I don't give a shit if the two
of you were fucking each other
in a bathtub of cocaine.

298
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,644
All I care about is stopping this maniac
before he kills again.

299
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,876
Do you understand?

300
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,075
- Yeah.
- So?

301
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:53,388
Well, we first met, of all places,
in the public library.

302
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,491
I was returning some books, & she was
taking out a whole stack, and...

303
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,723
I noticed they were all about sex...

304
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,494
so I made a friendly comment
and we got to talking and...

305
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,832
she told me she was doing research
for a book that she was writing.

306
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,398
I told her, being the voice of experience,
I might be able to help.

307
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,736
In what way?

308
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,400
I have this gig going.

309
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,380
It's kind of a scam. But, I do floating
swingers' parties.

310
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,949
See, I know some realtors who are
pretty big heavyweights, and...

311
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,849
I score dope for them, and in exchange...

312
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,652
they let me sublease these really primo
pads while the owner's out of town.

313
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,317
But, for what?

314
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,385
Well, then I place an ad,
and for $200 a couple...

315
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,557
they get to swing and dance and eat,
drugs, light show, all that stuff.

316
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,159
Anyway, Julia says she's interested.

317
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,763
Not to fuck, but to observe
for her research.

318
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,908
I tell her, <i>You can't hassle people,
paying that kind of bread.</i> Right?

319
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,141
She comes up with the idea that she'll
pay the couple's admission...

320
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,309
and in exchange, she'll get to observe
them and interview them.

321
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,411
I let her use my P.O. Box, and
that's how come the ad.

322
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,423
Do you know anyone she was seeing
she might have had a beef with?

323
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:03,427
No, but she said that she thought there was
someone that was following her for a while.

324
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,395
Black, white? Short, tall?

325
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,263
I would have to presume he was
white, otherwise she would have
said something.

326
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,528
When are you having your next party?

327
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,629
Why? Are you planning on coming?

328
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,140
I might. In the meantime, do you think
I could have a list of your regulars?

329
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,037
Come on, that's not very nice, is it?
Or don't I have a choice?

330
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,642
Yeah, you got a choice.

331
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,746
You can save innocent lives
or protect the anonymity of
a bunch of horny assholes.

332
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,655
Let me know when you decide.

333
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,855
Sergeant.

334
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,592
It's on a Rolodex at home.

335
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,298
I'll come get it.

336
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,267
I'm sure you will.

337
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,495
<i>You grieved me more than all the rest.</i>

338
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,768
All the rest?

339
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,038
Oh, no.

340
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,595
John? No shooting board
on the Wilson thing.

341
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,832
Harry, I need printouts on all the unsolved
female homicides...

342
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,960
in Los Angeles County for
the past 15 years.

343
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,470
I need them on my desk as soon
you can get them, okay?

344
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,268
- Last 15 years?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,830
- You got it.
- Thanks.

346
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,444
Need to talk to you later, Phil.

347
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,881
What do you have?

348
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,853
What do you make of this?

349
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,888
It looks like blood.

350
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,293
If it's human, I can get you a type
in four hours.

351
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,887
I need it in, like, 10 minutes.

352
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,866
- Yeah, but if it was wet I could do that.
- Just rinse it.

353
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,022
Hi, neither one of us is home just now...

354
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,756
but if you leave your name, number, time
you called and a short message...

355
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,391
we'll get back to you just as soon as
we can. Please wait for the beep.

356
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,163
Jen, hi. It's me. I guess you went out
to a movie with Penguin.

357
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,729
It's after 9:00. I'm going to be here
for quite some time.

358
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,302
Make that all night.

359
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,540
Kiss Penny good night for me,
and sleep well.

360
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,810
Bye-bye.

361
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,919
Oh, God.

362
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,695
Hey, Dutch. I was just looking
for you, man.

363
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,594
- You look all squeezed out, kid.
- I'm beat.

364
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,964
I have a real strong feeling
we got ourselves a serial on
this Niemeyer killing.

365
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,400
Anything behind that feeling?

366
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,495
The killer mailed Niemeyer
a poem yesterday.

367
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,406
Some of the lines of that poem could be
interpreted that he's killed before.

368
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,467
Funny he should write to a woman
he's already killed.

369
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,605
That's another thing. Subconsciously,
serial killers want to get caught.

370
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,979
I think he mailed the poem to Niemeyer
but wrote it to us.

371
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,108
You know what I mean, Dutch?

372
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,618
Aside from that, you got anything else?

373
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,744
Nothing much, really.

374
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,413
There's the partial prints
from that book...

375
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,854
at the Niemeyer apartment that I found.

376
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,017
The computer couldn't match them,
that's not unusual...

377
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,390
'cause the guy's probably never
been fingerprinted before.

378
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,859
What do you want from me?

379
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,360
Know how long it would take me
to get the case files on 31 unsolved
female homicides?

380
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,799
It would take two fucking weeks...

381
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,803
and I'd have to go through
an inquisition to do it.

382
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,169
You, on the other hand, could get them
tomorrow morning...

383
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,037
and nobody would ask a goddamn thing.

384
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,133
What would I tell them if they did?

385
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,839
I'll come up with a common denominator,
an M.O. or something.

386
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,882
Anything to get Gaffney and the fucking
department behind this thing.

387
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,747
Gaffney? Lloyd...

388
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,150
this is your Dutch uncle again,
and I'm telling you...

389
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,190
stay away from that born-again with
feelings about serial killers.

390
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,784
We all know that stuff panics the public
and embarrasses the department.

391
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,453
He's not gonna sit still...

392
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,554
How long is it gonna take
to get these files?

393
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,724
Thirty-one?

394
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,426
Thirty-one.

395
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,369
- They'll be on your desk in the morning.
- Attaboy.

396
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,276
- And don't forget tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night?

397
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,737
Estelle's giving a party for...

398
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,347
You'll see tomorrow.

399
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,976
She's counting on you and Jen being there.

400
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,485
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,620
Dear Lloyd, this is goodbye,
for a while at least.

402
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,400
Penny and I have gone to stay with
an old friend in San Francisco.

403
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,129
It's for the best.

404
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,468
I know that you and I
have not communicated
for a long, long time.

405
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,532
I'm not sure that we can again, as our
values are completely different.

406
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,373
You are a deeply disturbed person...

407
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,608
and I cannot allow you to pass
your disturbance on to Penny.

408
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,946
I'm withholding our address
in San Francisco...

409
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,748
until I am certain you will not try
to do anything rash.

410
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,583
I will call once we're settled.

411
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,591
Until then, be well and don't worry.

412
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,288
Love, Jen.

413
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,065
Jen?

414
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,302
No, is this Sergeant Hopkins?

415
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,573
That's right. Who's this?

416
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,811
This is Joanie Pratt. I was wondering what
you wanted to do about the Rolodex.

417
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,177
What Rolodex?

418
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,848
The party list of swingers. You seemed
to think it was important yesterday.

419
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,754
It's important. I should have it.

420
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,793
Have you had breakfast yet?

421
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,088
I haven't been to bed yet.

422
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,063
If you come over you can have
a little of both.

423
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,665
I thought you didn't like to talk to cops.

424
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,860
Who said anything about talking?

425
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,099
What's your address?

426
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,955
Okay.

427
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:43,173
Julia Lynn Niemeyer. Blonde hair, blue
eyes, age 29, West Hollywood.

428
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,705
Caucasian.

429
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,649
Black.

430
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,189
Hispanic.

431
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,685
Oriental.

432
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,524
Black.

433
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,363
Black.

434
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,039
Whatever.

435
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,907
Brown eyes, 5'4".

436
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,083
<i>Blue running pants. Blue shorts.</i>

437
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,259
<i>Gunshot wound to the head.</i>

438
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,328
Too old.

439
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,832
Hooker.

440
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:13,926
Hooker.

441
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,836
Hooker.

442
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,101
Old.

443
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,007
Okay. Talk to me.

444
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,083
Innocent.

445
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,387
Innocent.

446
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,225
Innocent.

447
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,971
All innocent.

448
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,456
These are yours.

449
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,020
Yes, Sergeant?

450
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,860
Sir, as you know, I've been working
full-time on the Niemeyer killing.

451
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,524
- Yes, and?
- Well, sir, so far, it's a stone-cold washout.

452
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,194
Then stick with it. I have faith in you.

453
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,134
Thank you, sir.

454
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,072
It's funny you mention that word, faith.

455
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,578
I say that because this case has been
a testing of my own meager faith.

456
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,646
I've never, as you can probably
well imagine...

457
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,045
been much of a believer in God, sir...

458
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,778
but the way I've been stumbling on certain
kinds of evidence in this case...

459
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,218
has me questioning my beliefs.

460
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:48,349
I go to church on Sunday and to prayer
meetings three times a week.

461
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,623
But when I put on my holster
I put God out of my mind.

462
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:55,223
You want something, you tell me what
it is, and stop all the bullshit.

463
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,527
Right.

464
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,039
Sir, in the course of my investigation
into the Niemeyer murder...

465
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,199
I've come across strong,
instinctive evidence...

466
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,607
that points to at least 16 other murders
of young women...

467
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,505
dating back 15 years.

468
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,912
The M.O. S are varied, but the victims
were all of a certain physical type.

469
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,280
Now, I've gotten the case files
on these homicides, and...

470
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,082
chronological consistencies
and other factors...

471
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,487
have convinced me that all 16 women
were killed by the same man.

472
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,320
The man, in fact, who
killed Julia Niemeyer.

473
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:26,261
What you do mean by <i>chronological
consistencies and other factors</i>?

474
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,821
There are four dates of death
on the exact same day.

475
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,925
June 10th, two in the early '70s
and two in late '70s.

476
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,630
And of these, two were listed
as gunshot suicides.

477
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,003
Now, any cop with half a brain
should have known...

478
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,235
that women almost never kill themselves
with guns.

479
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,471
Is that it?

480
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,638
The last two murders have been
particularly brutal...

481
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,648
which makes me believe
he's close to exploding.

482
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,479
That means we've got to
start pushing him, sir.

483
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,577
And I can do that with a dozen experienced
homicide dicks, full-time.

484
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,589
I want liaisons set up with every other
department in the country.

485
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,682
I need permission to recruit
uniformed officers...

486
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,227
for the shit work and
authority to grant...

487
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,285
unlimited overtime, and
most important, sir...

488
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,853
we need a full-scale media blitz...

489
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,762
I haven't heard any hard,
physical evidence.

490
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:06,269
You got any witnesses? Any notations from
detectives within our department...

491
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,238
or any department that lend credence
to your mass-murder theory?

492
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,638
No one's bothered to go over the files...

493
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,041
How many of these 16 investigations
are still open?

494
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,442
None. But that's the point.

495
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,504
Are there any other officers
within our department...

496
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,481
- who corroborate your hypothesis?
- No.

497
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,915
Other departments?

498
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,542
No.

499
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,054
Hopkins, I'm not gonna trust you on this.

500
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,292
Even though I must admit you're a good
detective with a good arrest record.

501
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,491
- Then what's the problem, sir?
- You know damn well what the problem is.

502
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:40,265
It's too old, too vague, too costly,
and too potentially embarrassing to
the department.

503
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,033
- That's bullshit!
- Don't talk to me about bullshit, Hopkins.

504
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,100
Everyone knows you have a wild hair up
your ass about murdered women.

505
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,873
And if you really cared about God...

506
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,779
you'd first ask him to help you
with your personal life.

507
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,046
Hopkins, forget this thing.

508
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,355
Spend some time with your family.
I'm sure they'd appreciate it.

509
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,414
- Thank you for the advice, Captain.
- Hopkins.

510
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,429
If you go to the media, I'll crucify you.

511
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,497
I'll have you back in uniform, rousting
piss bums on Skid Row.

512
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,435
Two days. That's what you've got
to give me the help I need.

513
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:19,099
After that, you can get your fucking
field reports on the 6:00 news, sir.

514
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,372
Sergeant?

515
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,499
What can I do for you, sir?

516
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,002
How long you been with the Sheriff's
department, Haines?

517
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,370
Nine years.

518
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,207
- How long at the West Hollywood station?
- Eight.

519
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,140
Still live on Larrabee?

520
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,910
That's right.

521
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,683
I'm surprised.

522
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,016
West Hollywood is a faggot sewer,
isn't it?

523
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,982
I think a good cop should live
on his beat.

524
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,561
So do I. What do your friends
call you? Delbert, Del?

525
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,725
Whitey. So, what is it?

526
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,668
What am I here for?

527
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,840
- Does your beat include Westbourne Drive?
- Yes, sir.

528
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,711
You've worked the same car plan
your whole time at the station?

529
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,974
Yeah, except for a loan-out to Vice.

530
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,847
- You ever work Narco?
- No.

531
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,643
No.

532
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,848
Coffee.

533
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,213
Just checking.

534
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,620
Basically, I'm here to check on
some homicides that took place
a few years back.

535
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:23,030
You know, looking over the files,
I noticed you came across a...

536
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,465
stiff back in '78.

537
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,098
Wrist-slash job.

538
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,504
A woman on Westbourne.
Does that ring a bell?

539
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:35,738
Yeah, my partner and I got an unknown
trouble squawk from the desk.

540
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,946
Some old bag was complaining about
this stiff's radio blasting. So...

541
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,281
You found another suicide in your
own building the very next year.

542
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,520
That's right, isn't it, Whitey?

543
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:50,716
I sure did. Matter of fact, I got
messed up by the gas.

544
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,524
They had to detox me at the hospital.
But they gave me a commendation.

545
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,531
<i>Deputy of the Month.</i> And they
put my picture up in...

546
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,397
Both these women killed
themselves on June 10.

547
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,729
Doesn't that strike you as
a strange coincidence?

548
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,039
Maybe. Shit, I don't know.

549
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,776
Neither do I.

550
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,344
That's all, Haines.

551
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,149
You can go.

552
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,133
Whitey, you said you wouldn't
raise my nut, man.

553
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,769
Giving you six bills a month,
plus half the dope action...

554
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,399
plus kickbacks from half the punks
on the street. You said...

555
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,638
Don't tell me what the fuck I said.

556
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:53,679
That's what I said. That takes
money. There's a transfer-happy
new day watch...

557
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,620
Dutch, could you check with Internal
Affairs and see if...

558
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,959
Delbert W. Haines, badge 408, is under
investigation? He's a deputy sheriff.

559
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,696
Haines. Yeah, I'll hold.

560
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,729
Dave, can you get me a printout on all
monikers with Bird...

561
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,763
Birdie, Birdman, anything like that, bring
it to me right away? Thank you.

562
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,037
Dutch? Yeah, hi.

563
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,474
No investigation?

564
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,339
No surveillance?

565
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,515
Nothing on Haines? Okay, thanks.

566
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,983
I'll be there. I just gotta go home
and change...

567
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,455
I have to go to a couple
of feminist bookstores.

568
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:32,393
Don't ask. No, I'll be there. Okay, Dutch,
thanks a lot. Bye.

569
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,891
Don't you ever talk to me like a cunt.

570
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,197
Would you open the door, please?

571
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,776
I'm Detective Sergeant Lloyd Hopkins
with the police department.

572
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,181
You with the Intelligence division?

573
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,845
No. Why?

574
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:35,352
The police has a long history of trying to
infiltrate causes they deem subversive.

575
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,916
My poetry has been published
in feminist periodicals...

576
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,724
that are highly critical of your
department. Also this...

577
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,994
You can breathe easy. I'm gonna leave that
to Intelligence, alright?

578
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,365
I'm here on a completely different matter.

579
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,202
May I come in please, Miss...

580
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,874
My name is Kathleen McCarthy,
and I prefer Ms.

581
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,539
Ms. Okay. As long as you promise
not to call me a police person.

582
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,874
- Come in.
- Thank you.

583
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,888
I am here to investigate a murder of a
woman named Julia Lynn Niemeyer.

584
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,398
You wouldn't know her, would you?

585
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,462
No.

586
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,976
I have reason to believe the killer
is interested in poetry.

587
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,444
Possibly in this feminist poetry
in particular.

588
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,050
What led me to this is,
I found a bloodstained book
at the crime scene.

589
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,247
Rage in the Womb. Do you know the book?

590
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,754
Of course.

591
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,853
I'm sure it was her book. She had this
little feminist poetry section...

592
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:51,332
on her desk, and there was a space where
the book was missing. I'm sure he...

593
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,727
the killer, went through it.

594
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,739
And that makes you think he's interested
in feminist poetry?

595
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,969
That, and the fact that...

596
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:06,705
he sent a poem to her post office box
a few days after he killed her.

597
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,877
It was an original poem, and there was
a line in it that convinced me...

598
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,979
that he's killed before and will,
no doubt, kill again.

599
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,420
Look, Miss...Ms. McCarthy...

600
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,825
I don't want to tell you the condition in
which I found the Niemeyer woman.

601
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,928
But I will tell you the poem was written
in human blood.

602
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:25,723
God.

603
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,169
His own, probably, which
gives you some idea...

604
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,468
of the kind of psychopath
we're dealing with.

605
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,134
What is it you want from me?

606
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,842
I need...

607
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:43,946
I need feedback on this Rage in the Womb.
What is it about? What kind of book is it?

608
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,118
I need to know if you've had
strange men in your store...

609
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,851
specifically men in their 30s...

610
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:53,294
buying feminist literature,
acting angry, or furtive, or in
any way out of the ordinary.

611
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,234
Rage in the Womb is an angry book.
It's a polemic...

612
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:05,263
a broadside against many things, violence
perpetuated on women in specific.

613
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,310
I think I sold my last copy a month ago.

614
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,001
To a man or a woman?

615
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,111
I don't think I've ever sold
a copy to a man.

616
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,251
Actually...

617
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,045
I don't think...

618
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,653
I've had a single man in his 30s in here.

619
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,655
Never.

620
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,802
That's that.

621
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,537
I'm sorry.

622
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,445
I'd like to help any way I can.

623
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:44,741
Really.

624
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,916
You wouldn't like to start with
a cup of coffee, would you?

625
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,886
Right now I'm running on empty.

626
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,754
Okay. Sure.

627
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,786
Great.

628
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,070
Lloyd, I'm so glad you made it.

629
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,942
Hi, Estelle. This is Kathleen McCarthy.

630
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,081
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Estelle and Dutch Peltz.

631
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,650
- Miss McCarthy, a pleasure.
- That's Ms.

632
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:23,841
Oh, yeah. Ms.

633
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,789
- Still a pleasure.
- It's nice to meet you both.

634
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,653
- How you doing, kid?
- Just great.

635
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,792
- Why don't you get Ms. McCarthy a...
- Kathleen.

636
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,056
Why don't you get Kathleen a drink?
You know where.

637
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,119
Okay, great.

638
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,933
Then maybe we should talk for a minute.
I'll be in the kitchen.

639
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,991
Great.

640
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,469
- Captain.
- Sergeant.

641
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:56,312
- Would you like a drink?
- Actually, I'd rather smoke a joint.

642
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,378
Well, the guest list makes me nervous.

643
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,516
I work with these people. They
make me nervous, too, okay?

644
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,760
So, where's the powder room?

645
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,358
By the front door. Let's go this way.

646
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,566
Kathleen, I don't make you nervous, do I?

647
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,331
No.

648
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,435
- Not yet.
- Good.

649
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,143
- You dog.
- Dog.

650
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,913
- Chop another one?
- Not yet.

651
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,010
Tonight the night?

652
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,147
No, we are gonna sit around reading
feminist poetry. What do you think?

653
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,419
I didn't know there was going to be
all these heavy hitters here.

654
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,358
Well, that was a surprise, kid.

655
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,429
I took the captain's exam and passed high.

656
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,330
That's great. It couldn't come
at a better time, 'cause...

657
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,732
- I'm going to need all the clout I can get.
- That's my boy.

658
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,565
Couldn't even say congratulations
before...

659
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,400
you turn it into something
for your own benefit.

660
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,962
Come on, Dutch, that goes without saying.

661
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,474
Doesn't go without saying when you
want something, though, does it?

662
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,408
This means you heard about
my run-in with Gaffney?

663
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,843
Fucking A, I heard about it.

664
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,006
You think Gaffney's gonna let me forget
you are my boy?

665
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,142
He's wrong about this one, Dutch.
We've got ourselves a serial killer.

666
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,743
There is no way I'm gonna get him
without the help I need.

667
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,152
Five guys, that's all I ask.

668
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,247
I already used all my clout
to save your ass.

669
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,916
Now you want me to put it back
on the line?

670
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,154
I don't care where you put it,
as long as I get five men.

671
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,755
You better care, because that
group in there is gonna be running
the department.

672
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,459
And damn near half of them
are born-agains...

673
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,502
which means they will be gunning
for guys like you.

674
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:22,129
Every cunt hound, whoremonger,
troublemaker and kamikaze...

675
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,639
that doesn't go by the book
is on their shit list.

676
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,403
Give them a chance, they'll bounce
your ass right off the force.

677
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,274
So don't tell me you don't care
where I put it.

678
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,176
- Anything else I should know?
- Yeah.

679
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,873
I told Gaffney you'd apologize to him.

680
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,076
That's when I expected you to show up
with your wife...

681
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,550
instead of one of your girlfriends.

682
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,711
Shows you what a schmuck I am.

683
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,549
You had no play anyway, Dutch,
because my wife left me.

684
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,490
And I wouldn't apologize to
that sanctimonious cocksucker
Gaffney...

685
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,584
if he offered to cop my joint...

686
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,151
in the commissioner's office at high noon.

687
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,321
How about that?

688
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,732
We were just chatting about you.

689
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,002
Did you see my date?

690
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:22,295
Are we going any place in particular? It
looks like we just passed through here.

691
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,559
We did.

692
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,362
- Are you lost?
- Maybe I am.

693
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,532
I'm sorry, I just like to come down here
sometimes and drive around.

694
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,768
It helps me to clear things out.

695
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,542
- Why here?
- It's where I grew up.

696
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,677
You're kidding. You're not gonna
believe this. So did I.

697
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,009
- No.
- I swear.

698
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,611
- In Silver Lake?
- Back there on Tracy and Micheltorena.

699
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,019
Griffith Park and St. Elmo.

700
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,079
Oh, God!

701
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,751
How about Daniel Webster, class of '66?

702
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,524
Don't remind me. I'm trying to forget
that cesspool ever existed.

703
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,462
You know, I think it's just
right at this corner.

704
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,728
What do you say we swing by and
do a memory lane number?

705
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,827
Don't! Please, don't. I'm sorry.

706
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,030
I don't want to ever see that place again.

707
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,766
- Jesus, it couldn't have been that bad.
- Believe me, it was.

708
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,175
Look, can we just get out of here? Can we
just please get out of here?

709
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,740
Sure.

710
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,585
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

711
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:28,736
The actual truth of the matter is
that I transferred from parochial
school because...

712
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:31,774
the Mother Superior was always...

713
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:33,470
Thank you.

714
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:39,749
The Mother Superior was always trying
to get me to show her my breasts.

715
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,357
I talked about it in hygiene class
and attracted...

716
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,624
a following of lonely, bookish girls.
They became my court.

717
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:53,535
We were all poets, and we all wore
plaid skirts & cashmere sweaters.

718
00:59:54,403 --> 00:59:58,601
We didn't date. There wasn't one boy
worthy of us at Daniel Webster High.

719
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:02,339
We were saving it for Mr. Right.
We were convinced that...

720
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,778
he would appear on the scene when we
became published poets of renown.

721
01:00:06,415 --> 01:00:08,246
In the meantime, we...

722
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:12,813
We sort of loved and cared for each other.
Pathetic, isn't it?

723
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:14,345
No.

724
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,256
So what happened to your court?

725
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:28,595
It's what happened to me.

726
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:36,773
About a week before graduation...

727
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:41,581
some roughneck, a real...

728
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:45,449
bad kid, and his flunky...

729
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:49,215
decided to teach me a lesson.

730
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:53,991
I was working late at the Clarion.

731
01:00:54,697 --> 01:00:56,324
The school paper?

732
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:03,098
And they waited until I left
my locker, and...

733
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,440
they grabbed me and...

734
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:12,310
forced me into the boys' bathroom.

735
01:01:17,153 --> 01:01:19,485
I don't have to tell you what they did.

736
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:25,291
But nothing was ever the same
for me again.

737
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:37,404
I never told this story to a man before.

738
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,066
But I guess it was...

739
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:46,476
in the way of an explanation or apology
for how strange I was in the car.

740
01:01:49,952 --> 01:01:52,147
They say time heals anything.

741
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:57,515
I was too scared and ashamed
to tell the police.

742
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,423
And I was too stupid not to keep it
a secret from my court.

743
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:05,164
So, for one reason or another,
they all left.

744
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:07,326
They all left.

745
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:09,830
I suppose they had other virtues.

746
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,671
Loyalty wasn't one of them.

747
01:02:13,175 --> 01:02:16,667
The awful part of it was, it was the only
time I ever really needed them...

748
01:02:16,879 --> 01:02:18,471
and they weren't there.

749
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:25,242
Thanks.

750
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,150
I died.

751
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,182
My heart felt like it was buried forever.

752
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:32,416
So...

753
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:36,425
I tried looking for cheap kicks
and true love.

754
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:39,024
I even slept with a lot of women.

755
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,462
I was looking for a new entourage.

756
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:43,398
It didn't work.

757
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,906
So, I started screwing a lot of guys.

758
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,002
That got me the entourage, alright.
They were all creeps.

759
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:57,682
I thought the only thing worthy of my
heart and soul was my writing.

760
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:02,517
That's all I did. If it wasn't my poetry,
it was my diary.

761
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:07,460
My poetry finally got published,
and I bought this bookshop.

762
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:10,896
Here I am.

763
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:17,234
So, all's well that ends well.

764
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:22,733
Well, actually, it's not
the end of the story.

765
01:03:27,316 --> 01:03:30,308
I left out the most bizarre part
because I was...

766
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:34,183
I was afraid that, being a man,
you wouldn't understand...

767
01:03:34,256 --> 01:03:37,316
just how affected a woman can be
by this kind of thing.

768
01:03:41,597 --> 01:03:45,089
I got through the rape okay. I might
as well go for the whole enchilada.

769
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:49,262
- Is that a joke?
- Yeah, it's a joke.

770
01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:50,498
Are you kidding me?

771
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:53,440
See, this is what I'm talking about.
This is not funny to me.

772
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:54,908
You come in the store...

773
01:03:54,977 --> 01:03:56,706
you have a degree of sensitivity, I think.

774
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:57,871
That's the only reason I went out...

775
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:59,107
with you in the first place...

776
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:02,116
because you're a perfect stranger, and
a police person on top of that.

777
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:04,516
- I must be crazy. Maybe...
- Maybe what?

778
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,720
Look, Kathleen, just because a person uses
a few lines to lighten a subject...

779
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,658
doesn't mean that subject
is taken lightly, does it?

780
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:15,988
Does it?

781
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:19,692
I guess not.

782
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,497
I mean, I guess so.

783
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:26,364
Okay. So now you were going to tell me
a story.

784
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:27,466
I guess so.

785
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:31,240
So sit down, because I would
really like to hear it.

786
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:34,942
I really would. So...

787
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,587
once upon a time...

788
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:41,581
Once upon a time...

789
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:45,888
there was a quiet, bookish girl
who wrote poetry.

790
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:50,259
She didn't believe in God...

791
01:04:50,332 --> 01:04:53,324
or her parents, or the other girls
that followed her.

792
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:57,595
So she tried very hard
to believe in herself.

793
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:03,942
That was easy for a while, until
something terrible happened...

794
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,407
and everybody left her.

795
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:09,909
The loneliness became unbearable.

796
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:13,010
She contemplated putting an end to it all.

797
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:18,889
One day, she discovered
someone loved her.

798
01:05:21,497 --> 01:05:26,093
Some tender man sent her a poem
accompanied by flowers.

799
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,501
And he continued to send her flowers
periodically and anonymously...

800
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:32,871
for many years.

801
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:37,544
They always seemed to arrive just
when she needed them most.

802
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:45,118
For 15 years, this women has grown
as a poet and a diarist...

803
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:48,354
and she keeps his flowers pressed
and dated in glass...

804
01:05:48,924 --> 01:05:51,085
in a treasure chest in her bedroom.

805
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,489
She speculated on her dream lover...

806
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:58,599
but never tried to figure out
who he really was.

807
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:03,234
She's taken his anonymous tribute
to her heart...

808
01:06:04,273 --> 01:06:08,903
and decided to reciprocate his anonymity
by keeping her diaries private forever.

809
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:14,208
The moral of the story is...

810
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,379
there's a vast difference between
being alone and being lonely.

811
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:22,783
And she, no longer lonely...

812
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:26,124
knows that difference.

813
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:36,395
It almost makes you want to
believe in God, doesn't it?

814
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:50,116
You actually believe in white knights
and happy endings, don't you?

815
01:06:51,687 --> 01:06:54,679
- Isn't that what every girl dreams of?
- Yeah.

816
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:58,785
But in the meantime, they're
not saving it for Mr. Right.

817
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:02,290
Who said anything about saving it?

818
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:17,135
Do you realize...

819
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:20,876
what a terrible waste that would be?

820
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:24,213
Do you?

821
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,029
We're going to make love, aren't we?

822
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:41,628
I don't think we should fight it.

823
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:43,432
Do you?

824
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:48,570
I don't know what I think.
It just feels so wonderful.

825
01:07:48,644 --> 01:07:49,633
I know.

826
01:07:55,184 --> 01:07:58,984
Just one minute, okay?

827
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:05,993
Where are you going?

828
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,623
I just want to take a hot bath...

829
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:15,694
and smoke some grass.

830
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:19,462
I thought people usually smoked
and washed after.

831
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:23,277
You wouldn't want me to tense up,
would you?

832
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:24,778
Oh, God, no.

833
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,990
Jesus fucking Christ.

834
01:09:58,774 --> 01:10:01,504
Henderson. First name, Lawrence.
How's that for stepping in shit?

835
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:03,636
Get this. Cranfield came up
with a fiber element...

836
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:05,873
on that recorder outside
Whitey Haines's pad.

837
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,610
It's identical to the one found
in the Niemeyer apartment.

838
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,242
Probably from a white glove.

839
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,015
- That ties the killer to Whitey Haines.
- Jesus!

840
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:15,419
Okay, run a make on Henderson and
bring me what you get...

841
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,356
to Santa Monica and Fairfax.

842
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:18,916
I'm on my way.

843
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,827
Whitey Haines is escorting a convict
to the Wayside Honor Farm.

844
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:28,597
He's due back noon tomorrow.

845
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:29,830
How about Birdman? Anything?

846
01:10:29,905 --> 01:10:31,702
- Henderson's been printed.
- That figures.

847
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:34,606
- What's his rap sheet say?
- Not much, a few unpaid traffic warrants.

848
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:36,439
That doesn't figure. You got
a last address?

849
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:39,037
Yeah. It didn't check out,
but I've got these.

850
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,374
Pretty.

851
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,378
Let's go find this little faggot.

852
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,750
Maybe he'll tell us who's been bugging
Haines's apartment.

853
01:10:45,854 --> 01:10:47,412
Why don't you go west
to Crescent Heights...

854
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:48,854
I'll go east to La Brea. Back in...

855
01:10:48,924 --> 01:10:50,448
- An hour?
- You got it.

856
01:10:56,598 --> 01:10:59,192
I'm telling you, man, Whitey
wants more money.

857
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:01,494
Don't worry about it, Birdie.

858
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,030
Give your johns dime bags,
you'll clean up.

859
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:08,235
Clean this, asshole. What do you
think I am, a fucking janitor?

860
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,005
Might not be...

861
01:11:15,551 --> 01:11:17,519
How you doing, man? Need some company?

862
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:52,678
I'm Sergeant Hopkins, Parker Center
Homicide. How you doing?

863
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:54,688
- How you doing?
- MacGruder said I could take a look.

864
01:11:54,756 --> 01:11:55,814
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, come on in.

865
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:56,947
Appreciate it.

866
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:07,991
Jesus Christ. So much for
Birdman Henderson.

867
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,403
You think this is bad? You should
have been here a while ago.

868
01:12:11,473 --> 01:12:13,805
The guy's brains were scattered
all over the dresser.

869
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:16,809
Coroner came in, had to scoop
them up in a plastic bag.

870
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:19,739
Deputy, could you do me a favor
and wait outside?

871
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:21,009
Yeah, I'll be by the door.

872
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,072
What is that?

873
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,310
I forgot to tell you. There's...

874
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:25,080
some writing in blood underneath
the paper.

875
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:26,484
They covered it up so that the TV...

876
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:27,852
and news guys couldn't get hold of it.

877
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:29,652
- It's supposed to be a clue.
- Can I take a look?

878
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:30,714
Sure.

879
01:12:35,163 --> 01:12:36,460
What does that say?

880
01:12:36,531 --> 01:12:39,261
It looks like, <i>We shall never yield.</i>

881
01:12:41,703 --> 01:12:43,603
What the fuck does that mean?

882
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:46,137
I don't know.

883
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:51,071
We shall never yield

884
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,481
I think I know what it means.
Thanks, Deputy.

885
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:19,267
Fuck. Where is it? Shit.

886
01:14:22,537 --> 01:14:23,526
Yes.

887
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,805
<i>We shall never yield.</i>

888
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:42,014
<i>June 10, 1973.</i>

889
01:15:49,724 --> 01:15:51,988
<i>June 10, 1974.</i>

890
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:57,395
<i>June 10, 1975.</i>

891
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:05,004
<i>March 24, 1987, Julie Niemeyer.</i>

892
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:07,267
Bingo.

893
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:34,191
Hi, neither one of us is home
just now, but if you'll leave your
name, number, time you...

894
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,405
This is Lieutenant MacIntosh
of Internal Affairs.

895
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:41,374
Sergeant Hopkins, this message
is recorded to inform you...

896
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:45,243
that you are suspended from duty, pending
an Internal Affairs investigation.

897
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:46,746
It is incumbent upon you...

898
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,305
Fuck you.

899
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,744
Get up, you fuck!

900
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,178
Get the fuck up!

901
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:29,806
Get against the wall.

902
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,621
Walk it back. Slow. Walk it back.

903
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,792
<i>Henderson, Lawrence D...</i>

904
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:52,270
<i>a.k.a. Bird, Birdie, Birdman.</i>

905
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:55,935
Why would I kill him? He's my snitch.
Why would I kill my snitch?

906
01:18:56,077 --> 01:18:58,841
Don't fuck with me, Haines. You're in
deep enough shit as it is.

907
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:01,143
Read the goddamn file.

908
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:03,207
I intend to. Get your ass in that chair.

909
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:05,413
Put your hands in there. Sit on them.

910
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:12,053
Don't you move.

911
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:18,927
I'm gonna read this file.

912
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:21,133
Then you and I...

913
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:24,231
are gonna talk about the old days
in Silver Lake.

914
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:27,869
You know, I'm a Silver Lake
homeboy myself.

915
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:33,545
This is great.

916
01:19:34,215 --> 01:19:35,273
<i>Today...</i>

917
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,544
<i>I employed Lawrence Henderson
as my vice finger man.</i>

918
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,919
<i>I've told the men on the squad not
to bust him. He is a good snitch.</i>

919
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,654
<i>Respectfully, Delbert W. Haines,
Deputy Sheriff, Badge 408.</i>

920
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:49,956
That explains his clean rap sheet.

921
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:52,725
But it doesn't explain a Los Angeles
County Deputy Sheriff...

922
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,826
running dope and male prostitutes...

923
01:19:54,903 --> 01:19:57,963
and getting kickbacks from fruit hustlers
all over Boy's Town, does it?

924
01:19:59,574 --> 01:20:02,372
What are you going to do with
Henderson dead now?

925
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:04,100
Huh, Whitey?

926
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:06,003
Find yourself a new sewer?

927
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:09,181
When the Sheriff's dicks
link you to Henderson...

928
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,275
you're gonna have to find a whole
new career for yourself.

929
01:20:11,352 --> 01:20:14,753
Is that right? I'm clean all the way
down the goddamn line.

930
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:18,554
I don't know anything about Henderson's
murder or any of that other shit...

931
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:20,560
or what the fuck you're talking about.

932
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:25,197
You're on some kind of outlaw
trip here, man, otherwise you'd
have another cop...

933
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:29,566
here with you. I had you made
the other day when you talked
about those suicides.

934
01:20:29,637 --> 01:20:33,129
You're nothing but a punk cop who likes
to hassle other cops.

935
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:36,803
So you want to bust me for
stealing that file folder, you
bust away, homeboy...

936
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:38,675
'cause that's all you got on me.

937
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,782
Okay, fat boy.

938
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:49,748
Time for a walk down memory lane.

939
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:53,950
My God!

940
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:57,253
Kathleen McCarthy.

941
01:20:57,799 --> 01:21:01,132
- Who's that?
- Webster High, 1972, Kathleen McCarthy.

942
01:21:01,202 --> 01:21:02,760
A girl from high school.

943
01:21:02,837 --> 01:21:04,805
- It's not good enough, Whitey.
- What do you want?

944
01:21:04,873 --> 01:21:07,068
Whoever killed Henderson and God
knows how many women...

945
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:10,270
sends Kathleen McCarthy flowers
every time he kills.

946
01:21:11,412 --> 01:21:12,845
He also had your apartment bugged.

947
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:15,379
How the fuck do you think I connected you
and Henderson?

948
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:19,978
This killer has an obsession with you,
Whitey, and I want to know why.

949
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:22,482
Why the hell should I know?

950
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:25,918
You have five chances to tell me.

951
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:29,622
You're not going to do this, man.

952
01:21:30,932 --> 01:21:32,991
You haven't got the guts.

953
01:21:35,203 --> 01:21:38,229
Four chances. Now I'm gonna
give you a little help.

954
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:42,972
June 10, 1973. That's the first time
the killer contacted Kathleen.

955
01:21:43,044 --> 01:21:45,308
He sent her a little poem
and the flowers...

956
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,645
exactly one year before, you, Henderson,
Kathleen, and the killer were at...

957
01:21:48,716 --> 01:21:50,183
Webster High. Something happened.

958
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:52,344
Did you and the Birdman hurt somebody?

959
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:55,250
Who was it?

960
01:21:55,323 --> 01:21:56,915
We didn't do anything.

961
01:21:57,892 --> 01:21:59,257
What did you do?

962
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:02,588
- Three chances, Whitey.
- Just a cunt.

963
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:06,498
Are you gonna kill me over what happened
to some cunt 15 years ago?

964
01:22:06,568 --> 01:22:08,536
What did you do to her?

965
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:11,237
We just wanted to scare her, man.

966
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:13,069
We? Who's we?

967
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,165
Me and Bird.

968
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:16,574
You know, those bunch of cunts,
Kathy and her court...

969
01:22:16,644 --> 01:22:20,102
they put everybody down. So we started
going and we couldn't stop.

970
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:23,143
- What did you do?
- Raped her!

971
01:22:23,785 --> 01:22:26,618
You raped her. You fucking piece of shit!

972
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,384
And then we had a gangbang
with the two of us.

973
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,059
Who knew about it?

974
01:22:34,362 --> 01:22:36,296
Who loved Kathleen McCarthy...

975
01:22:36,764 --> 01:22:37,958
and wanted revenge?

976
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:39,021
God, man.

977
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:41,964
I don't know.

978
01:22:44,505 --> 01:22:48,168
You can pull that trigger till
you blow my head off...

979
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:51,172
but I cannot tell you what I don't know.

980
01:22:51,246 --> 01:22:52,975
Stop it.

981
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:02,452
Piece of shit.

982
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:20,997
What now?

983
01:23:21,509 --> 01:23:23,807
For you, nothing.

984
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:29,249
This will be at Internal Affairs
tomorrow. You're through as a
deputy sheriff, Haines.

985
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:33,651
You're a smart cop, Hopkins. You like
to hassle other cops.

986
01:23:33,988 --> 01:23:38,220
Maybe you and me can make a deal.
I'm just a little fish.

987
01:23:38,326 --> 01:23:40,556
You throw me back, and I guarantee you...

988
01:23:40,628 --> 01:23:42,994
I'll give you brass the size
of a school of sharks.

989
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:45,897
Keep talking. This thing's
still running, come on.

990
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:49,399
I've got to piss so bad,
I'm floating in it.

991
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:52,664
You really put a scare into me.

992
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,436
I'm going to go in there. When I come
back, we make a deal, right?

993
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:57,637
Okay, yeah.

994
01:23:58,246 --> 01:23:59,235
Go ahead.

995
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:24,327
Hey.

996
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:14,218
- Hello, Dutch here.
- Dutch, it's me.

997
01:25:14,288 --> 01:25:17,018
Where the hell have you been? You know
you're in a lot of trouble?

998
01:25:17,091 --> 01:25:18,922
I know, I shouldn't have
popped off last night...

999
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:21,985
That's history. I'm talking about
right now.

1000
01:25:22,563 --> 01:25:26,090
Your friend, Kathleen McCarthy, and her
attorney are sitting across the desk...

1001
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,761
from me, wanting to file a
complaint against you.

1002
01:25:28,836 --> 01:25:32,567
Dutch, that's bullshit. I left her
a note explaining what I did.

1003
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,904
Maybe you ought to get over here
and explain it again.

1004
01:25:34,976 --> 01:25:37,911
To be honest with you, Dutch, it'd be
better if you came over here.

1005
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:42,075
I just killed a cop and I think I'm gonna
need your help in squaring this one.

1006
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,854
Let's see.

1007
01:25:56,931 --> 01:26:00,594
In one day, suspended from the force,
breaking and entering, robbery...

1008
01:26:00,668 --> 01:26:01,930
and now possible murder.

1009
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:03,402
What you got lined up for tonight?

1010
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,995
I'm this close to getting the cocksucker.

1011
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:06,232
All I need is a little help.

1012
01:26:06,307 --> 01:26:07,296
What's a little help?

1013
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:08,865
From what I found at the McCarthy place...

1014
01:26:08,943 --> 01:26:10,376
and from what Haines just confessed to...

1015
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:13,505
I know they were both in the same class
at Webster High with the killer.

1016
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:16,277
Since we've got his prints from the book
at the Niemeyer murder...

1017
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,318
all we have to do is match them
with everyone else.

1018
01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:19,477
That's all?

1019
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:22,921
He's never been printed, so you can
eliminate everyone else who has.

1020
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,821
You'd still have about 20%.

1021
01:26:24,892 --> 01:26:27,725
You throw out Blacks, Chicanos, Asians,
you're down to less than 10.

1022
01:26:27,795 --> 01:26:29,262
What if he wasn't in the graduating class?

1023
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:31,992
- Or maybe he was a teacher?
- What if he was the fucking janitor?

1024
01:26:32,066 --> 01:26:35,297
I know all that, but we got to
start somewhere. Now, what
do you say?

1025
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:40,202
What about the McCarthy broad?
We gotta bring her in on this.

1026
01:26:40,274 --> 01:26:42,139
- So, we'll bring her in.
- You stay away from her.

1027
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:43,939
Right now, she trusts me.

1028
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:47,907
See what I can do about
having her cooperate.

1029
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:51,850
You know some place you can go?
Stay out of sight, out of trouble?

1030
01:26:51,986 --> 01:26:52,975
Do it.

1031
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:34,821
Sarge, you never got those names
from the Rolodex.

1032
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:38,588
I figured you could use them
more than I could.

1033
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:40,133
I've been suspended.

1034
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:43,496
Well, you need a shoulder to cry on?

1035
01:27:44,906 --> 01:27:47,534
To be honest with you,
dinner would be better.

1036
01:27:48,175 --> 01:27:50,006
Give me an hour, and you've got it.

1037
01:27:50,077 --> 01:27:51,305
I'll be there.

1038
01:27:53,814 --> 01:27:54,974
Thanks.

1039
01:28:06,394 --> 01:28:07,383
Hello.

1040
01:29:26,874 --> 01:29:29,206
Goddamn it.

1041
01:29:32,313 --> 01:29:34,110
Keep your mouth shut.
Let me do the talking.

1042
01:29:34,181 --> 01:29:35,944
Not a word. Not a peep.

1043
01:29:43,324 --> 01:29:44,586
Ms. McCarthy.

1044
01:29:50,197 --> 01:29:54,793
I hope you don't mind, but I asked
Sergeant Hopkins to join us.

1045
01:29:55,069 --> 01:29:57,162
He's got something to say to you.

1046
01:29:58,806 --> 01:30:00,296
I'm returning your diary.

1047
01:30:00,374 --> 01:30:02,865
If it's any consolation, I didn't read it.

1048
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:04,971
It's never been opened.

1049
01:30:10,384 --> 01:30:12,784
And I would like to extend my apologies.

1050
01:30:14,088 --> 01:30:17,455
Do you really think after what you did,
I'd be willing to help you?

1051
01:30:17,525 --> 01:30:19,720
Kathleen, you'd be helping yourself.

1052
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:23,355
We're convinced the mass
murderer is the one that's been
sending you the flowers.

1053
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:25,729
Oh, Christ. This is ridiculous.

1054
01:30:27,334 --> 01:30:30,701
He's a gentle, tender man, who's incapable
of hurting anyone.

1055
01:30:30,771 --> 01:30:34,502
You have, believe me, no idea
what this man is capable of.

1056
01:30:34,575 --> 01:30:36,873
All you know is what you've created
in your own fantasy.

1057
01:30:36,944 --> 01:30:37,933
Lloyd.

1058
01:30:38,212 --> 01:30:42,012
Whoever he is, Kathleen, he has this
twisted, obsessive love for you...

1059
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:45,314
that dates back to when you
were in the same class together
in high school.

1060
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:46,944
Dates back to the day that
you were raped...

1061
01:30:47,021 --> 01:30:49,216
by Delbert Haines, and again by
Lawrence Henderson.

1062
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,780
You're sick.

1063
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:53,588
Dutch, I'm sorry. This is
a capital murder case.

1064
01:30:53,694 --> 01:30:55,389
The killer knew who the rapists were...

1065
01:30:55,463 --> 01:30:58,728
and he knew about your court of girlfriends
deserting you after it happened.

1066
01:30:58,799 --> 01:31:02,166
He has been punishing the same innocent
types of women ever since.

1067
01:31:02,236 --> 01:31:04,397
That's the modus operandi of this crime.

1068
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:06,235
You'd make up anything to hurt me,
wouldn't you?

1069
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:07,774
Did I make up the dates of the murders?

1070
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:10,037
Did I make up the dates he
sent you the flowers?

1071
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:13,080
For 15 years, they've been within a day
of each other every time.

1072
01:31:13,147 --> 01:31:14,409
This is insane.

1073
01:31:14,482 --> 01:31:16,347
Jesus Christ! She's supposed
to be a feminist.

1074
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:19,909
Don't you give a shit about
all the innocent women this
lunatic has been killing?

1075
01:31:19,987 --> 01:31:21,284
Don't you dare attack me!

1076
01:31:21,355 --> 01:31:23,550
You're the only lunatic
in this sordid mess!

1077
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:25,683
I am not gonna deal with this lunatic.

1078
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,921
You sit down and shut up!

1079
01:31:28,395 --> 01:31:29,384
Alright?

1080
01:31:30,397 --> 01:31:31,386
Yeah, alright.

1081
01:31:34,835 --> 01:31:36,666
Kathleen, I'm sorry.

1082
01:31:37,371 --> 01:31:39,999
Just hold on one second. Let me
show you how this breaks down.

1083
01:31:40,074 --> 01:31:43,009
We got 30 names that according
to the national computer...

1084
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:44,237
have never been fingerprinted.

1085
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:46,541
Of these, two are deceased,
four have moved away...

1086
01:31:46,614 --> 01:31:48,309
16 are either Blacks, Chicanos or Asians.

1087
01:31:48,382 --> 01:31:50,247
One is a well known professional
ball player...

1088
01:31:50,317 --> 01:31:52,376
and one is an equally well known
entertainer.

1089
01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:56,219
You see, that leaves six names
circled in red.

1090
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:58,053
That's all you have to do. Just six names.

1091
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,854
It'll be a couple of seconds.

1092
01:31:59,994 --> 01:32:02,690
Let me show you just how it's gonna go,
alright?

1093
01:32:02,997 --> 01:32:04,021
Thank you.

1094
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:06,089
You see, what we'd like you to do,
Kathleen...

1095
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:09,728
is simply tell us everything
you can possibly remember
about each individual...

1096
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:13,365
as I call out his name. You can
use the yearbook picture to refresh
your memory.

1097
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,169
And just take as much time as you need.

1098
01:32:15,242 --> 01:32:18,769
I know I agreed to do this,
but nonetheless, it just seems
really unfair...

1099
01:32:18,846 --> 01:32:21,246
to ask me to condemn these people
because of some...

1100
01:32:21,315 --> 01:32:23,146
character trait they had as teenagers.

1101
01:32:23,217 --> 01:32:25,082
Fuck this bullshit! We're wasting time.

1102
01:32:25,152 --> 01:32:27,347
Dutch, I'm gonna get this cocksucker
with what we've got.

1103
01:32:27,421 --> 01:32:29,787
You'll sit down! That's what you'll do!

1104
01:32:32,593 --> 01:32:35,619
I'm not staying here unless
this fucker shuts up!

1105
01:32:35,696 --> 01:32:37,391
He's going to shut up! Right?

1106
01:32:37,565 --> 01:32:38,554
Right.

1107
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:42,329
He's not going to open his mouth again.
Alright? Okay?

1108
01:32:43,237 --> 01:32:44,864
I promise you that. Here, let me, here...

1109
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:48,102
Just sit down. It'll only take a couple
of seconds, alright? Come on.

1110
01:32:49,276 --> 01:32:51,039
You'll see how easy it is.

1111
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:59,016
Now we'll start with Benson.

1112
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:04,023
First name, Claude. I got all the pictures
right here. See this? Remember him?

1113
01:33:11,098 --> 01:33:13,794
Yeah, I remember him. I didn't know him.

1114
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:15,731
There's nothing I can tell you
about this man.

1115
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:17,430
Okay, that's alright.

1116
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:20,032
You'll do the best you can. How about...

1117
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:22,234
Dennison, first name, Earl.

1118
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:23,936
Right here.

1119
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,281
Yes, I remember him.

1120
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:33,882
- Dennis the Menace.
- Menace?

1121
01:33:36,423 --> 01:33:38,152
To all the other schools.

1122
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:40,518
Okay? He was a star athlete.

1123
01:33:43,197 --> 01:33:44,892
Seems like all he did was sports.

1124
01:33:44,965 --> 01:33:46,455
You didn't know him?

1125
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:48,831
The athletes liked the cheerleader types.

1126
01:33:51,138 --> 01:33:52,765
How about Franco?

1127
01:33:53,507 --> 01:33:55,270
First name, Robert.

1128
01:34:14,628 --> 01:34:16,027
What about Franco?

1129
01:34:20,334 --> 01:34:21,631
I remember him.

1130
01:34:21,902 --> 01:34:23,802
What? What did she say?

1131
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:27,100
I want to see the two of you. Right away.

1132
01:34:27,174 --> 01:34:28,163
Yes, sir.

1133
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:34,608
Look, we've just got three more
names. You see everything that's
circled in red.

1134
01:34:34,682 --> 01:34:37,048
You can see that and what's covered there.

1135
01:34:37,117 --> 01:34:39,585
Write down anything you remember
about them.

1136
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,188
Take all the time you need.
We'll be right back.

1137
01:34:42,256 --> 01:34:44,053
Just take a minute.

1138
01:34:49,096 --> 01:34:51,826
- How'd I do?
- Terrific. Nice, light touch.

1139
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,861
Let's see what he wants.

1140
01:35:00,207 --> 01:35:02,232
My business is with Hopkins.

1141
01:35:02,509 --> 01:35:05,876
But since you seem to have a protective
interest in this troublemaker...

1142
01:35:05,946 --> 01:35:07,777
you'd better hear this, too.

1143
01:35:09,016 --> 01:35:12,508
Hopkins, this the only time
I'm actually pleased...

1144
01:35:12,586 --> 01:35:14,850
you've shown up where you don't belong.

1145
01:35:15,222 --> 01:35:19,090
Because now I can hear first-hand
your explanation of this.

1146
01:35:21,061 --> 01:35:23,325
Christ! He must've been in the house
the whole time.

1147
01:35:23,397 --> 01:35:24,421
- Who?
- The killer.

1148
01:35:24,498 --> 01:35:25,726
Who do you think took this picture?

1149
01:35:25,799 --> 01:35:27,664
What I wanna know is what
were you doing there?

1150
01:35:27,735 --> 01:35:28,759
What was I doing there?

1151
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:31,202
What the fuck does it look like
I was doing there?

1152
01:35:31,271 --> 01:35:32,533
Come on, Dutch, we're wasting time.

1153
01:35:32,606 --> 01:35:34,039
Look, let me finish up in there, and...

1154
01:35:34,108 --> 01:35:37,635
You've already finished in there.
As a matter of fact, you've finished
everywhere.

1155
01:35:37,711 --> 01:35:41,340
If Dutch weren't here to vouch
for you, I'd have you taken into
custody right now.

1156
01:35:41,415 --> 01:35:44,851
As it is, there's going to be a
hearing to determine if you're
to be brought up...

1157
01:35:44,918 --> 01:35:46,977
on criminal charges on a half-dozen
different beefs...

1158
01:35:47,054 --> 01:35:48,282
including killing a fellow officer.

1159
01:35:48,355 --> 01:35:49,344
Is that all?

1160
01:35:49,423 --> 01:35:51,084
I'll take your badge and
I'll take your gun.

1161
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:54,355
I'll take your word that he'll no longer
interfere with the investigation...

1162
01:35:54,428 --> 01:35:55,861
and be available for the hearing.

1163
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:57,328
- You got it.
- Okay.

1164
01:35:58,165 --> 01:36:00,326
- That's all.
- Thank you.

1165
01:36:09,443 --> 01:36:10,808
This is shocking.

1166
01:36:46,447 --> 01:36:47,573
Shit.

1167
01:37:11,772 --> 01:37:13,569
- Hello.
- Hello?

1168
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:16,433
Is this Bobby Franco?

1169
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:17,869
Yes, it is.

1170
01:37:18,312 --> 01:37:20,212
Thank God I reached you.

1171
01:37:21,748 --> 01:37:23,739
You may not remember me, but...

1172
01:37:24,384 --> 01:37:28,718
my name is Kathleen McCarthy from
Daniel Webster High School.

1173
01:37:28,789 --> 01:37:31,781
- I remember you well, Kathleen.
- You do?

1174
01:37:34,228 --> 01:37:36,492
You may not believe this, but...

1175
01:37:36,563 --> 01:37:39,555
there's this crazy policeman...

1176
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:42,998
who's got your name on a list
of suspects that...

1177
01:37:43,337 --> 01:37:45,237
he thinks is a mass murderer.

1178
01:37:45,539 --> 01:37:46,938
Why would he think that?

1179
01:37:47,007 --> 01:37:48,099
I don't know.

1180
01:37:48,175 --> 01:37:50,973
He's got some insane ideas of...

1181
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:53,905
But when he finds out that
you were a poet...

1182
01:37:53,981 --> 01:37:57,178
and that you were on the poetry review
with me...

1183
01:37:57,851 --> 01:38:00,342
he'll come after you.
He'll swear it's you.

1184
01:38:00,787 --> 01:38:02,277
He's gonna hurt you.

1185
01:38:02,356 --> 01:38:03,721
What's his name?

1186
01:38:04,424 --> 01:38:06,187
Sergeant Lloyd Hopkins.

1187
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:09,395
Okay, you've heard my name,
now tell me yours.

1188
01:38:09,463 --> 01:38:11,192
What's in a name, Hopkins?

1189
01:38:11,265 --> 01:38:14,325
- Did you get my message?
- Yes, I got your message.

1190
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:16,130
I've also got Kathleen McCarthy.

1191
01:38:16,203 --> 01:38:18,068
Now, she can tell me your name,
what is it?

1192
01:38:18,138 --> 01:38:19,196
Don't hurt her.

1193
01:38:19,273 --> 01:38:20,331
Don't hurt anyone else.

1194
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:23,570
Let her go, Hopkins. She's not
like all the rest.

1195
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:25,973
What? Are you talking to deal?

1196
01:38:26,046 --> 01:38:27,172
Just let her go.

1197
01:38:27,247 --> 01:38:29,647
- Then what?
- Then we just got you and me.

1198
01:38:30,817 --> 01:38:32,614
That's the kind of deal I like.

1199
01:38:32,686 --> 01:38:36,019
- You pick the time and the place, homeboy.
- How about a reunion?

1200
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:39,991
- Webster High in an hour.
- You got it.

1201
01:38:41,195 --> 01:38:44,528
Why would you do that?

1202
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:46,494
I thought he was innocent.

1203
01:38:47,768 --> 01:38:50,862
I thought you would persecute
what I thought was a...

1204
01:38:50,938 --> 01:38:54,840
- talented and sensitive boy. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1205
01:38:55,909 --> 01:38:57,001
It's okay.

1206
01:38:57,411 --> 01:39:00,209
Just get back in there and
give Dutch his name...

1207
01:39:00,414 --> 01:39:03,076
in case he doesn't show up.

1208
01:39:04,451 --> 01:39:06,578
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

1209
01:39:06,687 --> 01:39:07,915
I don't know.

1210
01:39:08,255 --> 01:39:10,815
Maybe this time you'll get to send him
the flowers.

1211
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,407
What're you doing up there?

1212
01:45:35,475 --> 01:45:37,102
The class is down here.

1213
01:46:11,578 --> 01:46:13,910
Looks like you didn't do your homework,
Sergeant.

1214
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:16,676
A sawed-off shotgun won't cut it
from up there.

1215
01:47:18,678 --> 01:47:21,340
Don't even think about it.

1216
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:31,049
Get up.

1217
01:47:42,135 --> 01:47:43,159
Well?

1218
01:47:43,336 --> 01:47:44,394
Well, what?

1219
01:47:44,471 --> 01:47:46,769
Aren't you going to read me my rights?

1220
01:47:46,873 --> 01:47:49,774
Cuff me? Take me into custody?

1221
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:52,835
Why, so you can sit in a
nice comfortable cell?

1222
01:47:52,912 --> 01:47:56,075
Let your smart-ass lawyer cop an
insanity plea, is that the idea?

What's it to you, Hopkins?

1224
01:47:59,352 --> 01:48:01,718
You're a cop. You've got to take me in.

1225
01:48:04,124 --> 01:48:06,592
There's some good news, and
there's some bad news.

1226
01:48:07,694 --> 01:48:11,357
The good news is, you're right, I'm a cop
and I got to take you in.

1227
01:48:11,865 --> 01:48:15,164
The bad news is I've been suspended,
and I don't give a fuck.
