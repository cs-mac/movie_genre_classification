1
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,809
Come on, let's go.

2
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:49,270
Come on.

3
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:52,273
Pick a spot.

4
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,777
Take a dump. Let's go.

5
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,451
Who's that?

6
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:06,829
Hey.

7
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,290
Evening.

8
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,957
Hey, Vaughn.

9
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,461
<i>Hey, Jack.</i>

10
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,755
I see he's got you well trained.

11
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:19,132
Who's walking who, right?

12
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:23,304
Whew.

13
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,139
How you, uh...

14
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:27,266
how you holding up?

15
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,019
It's day by day, you know.

16
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,105
But I'm gonna be all right.

17
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:33,980
Yeah, these things take time.

18
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,526
<i>Hmm.</i>

19
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:39,986
Well, exercise helps.
I've been running a lot.

20
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,823
And I've been lifting weights.

21
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,324
Can you tell?

22
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,868
I got two tickets to the gun show.

23
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,332
You're a funny son of a bitch, Vaughn.

24
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:57,004
No, I mean I got two
tickets to the gun show.

25
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:03,343
Now look, I've got my van
parked right down the street.

26
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:07,557
You and I are going
to take a little jog.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,850
What's this about, man?

28
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,310
I think you know what this is about.

29
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:13,062
No, I don't know what this is about!

30
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:17,233
I think you do... know...
what... this... is... about!

31
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,864
Turn your ass around...

32
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:25,408
and we're gonna run up the road.

33
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:26,701
All right, Vaughn.

34
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:27,952
Come on.

35
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:32,248
Turn around.

36
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,332
Turn around! Let's go.

37
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,584
Damn it, Vaughn!

38
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,043
Turn around. Let's go.

39
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,878
<i>Go home, Max. All right!</i>

40
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,380
<i>Come on, let's go come on...</i>

41
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:40,756
We're gonna jog.

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,675
We're gonna jog. Run.

43
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:43,676
What are you doin'?

44
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,760
Run. Run!

45
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,053
Let's go. Run.

46
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,347
Come on, let's go. Run.

47
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,272
Almost done.

48
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:59,942
You dug that pretty quick.

49
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:02,612
But then again, it is fresh dirt.

50
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:10,036
All right. One more.

51
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:15,749
<i>One more.</i>

52
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,959
All done.

53
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,423
Put the shovel right over here.

54
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,257
Right there.

55
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:27,470
What?

56
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:28,304
Come on...

57
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:29,388
Hey!

58
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,269
Open it.

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,897
Oh, Jesus Christ.

60
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:40,608
No, man.

61
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,276
Open it.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,611
Don't make me do this, friend.

63
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,488
Open it.

64
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,038
Ooh-hoo.

65
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,040
What the fuck?

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,102
God! Ohhh!

67
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,436
Comfy?

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,146
Vaughn, don% do this, man.

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,024
Look... I swear to God...

70
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,278
no one's going to know
anything about this.

71
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,406
I'll never tell anybody.
I'll never tell a soul.

72
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,200
Oh. Oh, please.

73
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,828
Please. Oh, no. Please don't do this.

74
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,331
Vaughn! Look, man, we go way back!

75
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:39,499
What, it's gonna be our little secret?

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,044
Yes, it is.

77
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,296
I don't think so.

78
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,755
Come on.

79
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,341
I'll tell you what, maggot-meat...

80
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,552
What?

81
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,054
I'll leave the light on for you.

82
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,723
Jesus!

83
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:55,891
Vaughn!

84
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,394
Woo-hoo.

85
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,151
Fuck.

86
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:08,487
Vaughn!

87
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,323
Vaughn!

88
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,208
Vaughn!

89
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,712
I don't have air!

90
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:37,933
So someone give me an
impression of The Telltale Heart.

91
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:38,851
Who wants to start?

92
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:44,357
Danny?

93
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:50,236
I thought the blue eye was kinda cool.

94
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,739
Okay. Anything else?

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,908
He really loves exclamation points.

96
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:57,953
All right.

97
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,122
Hey, Travis. What about you?

98
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,708
<i>What is Poe really telling
us about this murderer?</i>

99
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,251
Hmm. I don't know.

100
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,088
Oh, come on, Travis...

101
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,673
we don't have optional
participation in this class.

102
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:13,636
<i>Say you were encouraging a friend
to read it. What would you tell him?</i>

103
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,099
I'd say... you're inside
this killer's head.

104
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:21,394
The longer you're in
it, the scarier it gets.

105
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:25,815
Why is it scary?

106
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:28,317
Because he's crazy.

107
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,777
Are you sure?

108
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:35,157
Well, he keeps telling us that he's not.

109
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:40,287
<i>Abby, what do you think?</i>

110
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,164
I would have to agree with Travis.

111
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,375
He's definitely crazy.

112
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,169
Anyone that would kill somebody
just because they had a funny eye.

113
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,588
Damn right. And he slab-chops the dude.

114
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,633
So, Brian, you're saying he
cuts him into little pieces.

115
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:56,929
Right. Then he hides it
all underneath the floor.

116
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,973
So why would he go to all that
trouble to hide the body...

117
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,767
if he's gonna confess?

118
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,311
I guess because he knew
the cops could hear it.

119
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,480
You know? The heart beating and all?

120
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,816
But Miss Moore, I don't
think it was beating.

121
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,278
I think he just thought it was
beating because he was mental.

122
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,655
Yeah, he was nuts, so
he was hearing shit.

123
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:19,159
Stuff.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,162
Okay. Okay.

125
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:24,373
So what would make somebody
keep hearing something...

126
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,168
a sound, if it's all in his head...

127
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:32,173
that would drive him to confess?

128
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,883
Travis.

129
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:39,972
Uh, it was, uh... guilt.

130
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,227
<i>Don't forget, we continue
with Macbeth next week.</i>

131
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,980
I want you to review
Act Ill this weekend.

132
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:51,525
To get us in the mood, Travis
and Abby will do a scene...

133
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,360
as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.

134
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:56,906
Maybe you can come by
for pizza, like sevenish?

135
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:59,241
Sure. We should really go that way.

136
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,368
Okay, Brian. Hold on.

137
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,497
Ooh. "Never shake thy gory locks at me."

138
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,165
What?

139
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,376
Sit worthy, my friends.
My lord often thus.

140
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,670
<i>Macbeth. Yeah.</i>

141
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:13,881
No one has any idea what
you two are talking about.

142
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,424
Isn't that where he sees the ghost?

143
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,260
Yeah.

144
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,513
You won't have any
trouble nailing that scene.

145
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,556
What do you mean?

146
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,350
Nothing.

147
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,768
Uh, does anyone else
getting tired of pizza?

148
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,019
Danny, you can get wings.

149
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:28,812
Abby, we should go.

150
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,064
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:32,858
It should come easy...

152
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,903
since I saw something strange
the night my sister died.

153
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,280
Like a... like a ghost?

154
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:40,407
I don't know what it was.

155
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,992
But I saw something.

156
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,369
No, no, please, we're all friends here.

157
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,703
Why don't you share with us?

158
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,330
<i>Brian.</i>

159
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:48,082
No, I'm just curious. Let me guess.

160
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:49,542
<i>You called your ghost Richard Headen...</i>

161
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,960
you know, in Dickhead for short.

162
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,044
Kinda like what they call you.

163
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,046
Mm. You're funny.

164
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,714
Aren't I? I'm a funny guy.

165
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,550
Brian, it's his sister.

166
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,051
Oh, fine, he brought it
up. It's not my fault.

167
00:08:59,134 --> 00:08:59,969
Nice, Brian.

168
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,560
Travis.

169
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,730
Mr. Sovic.

170
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,566
You were supposed to come see me.

171
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,986
Yeah.

172
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:20,114
Travis, you've never come out
for track or baseball, have you?

173
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,824
Nope.

174
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,742
All you do is P.E.

175
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:26,161
Yeah, just P.E.

176
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,163
Track tryouts are next week.

177
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:29,123
I'd like to see you out there.

178
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,207
I gotta go...

179
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,458
Listen a second.

180
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,294
You know what's neat about track?

181
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,671
<i>Hmm.</i>

182
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:37,298
There's always a goal.

183
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,632
You're always running towards something.

184
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,968
Now, you see...

185
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,304
I think you'd be good at that.

186
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,514
Just not interested.

187
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,765
Not interested, huh?

188
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,475
I see.

189
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,020
I guess I've been wasting my time.

190
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:00,987
What was all that crap?

191
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,989
The hell if I know.

192
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,199
Let's go.

193
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,457
Sovic's a creep.

194
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,667
Yeah.

195
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,377
Is he even married?

196
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:16,795
It wouldn't surprise me if he wasn't.

197
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,048
Probably not, man.

198
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:21,342
Ahh, I think he's got
a thing for Miss Moore.

199
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:25,346
Ohhh, that'd be interesting.

200
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,972
Gotta mow Ely's lawn tomorrow?

201
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:28,766
Yep.

202
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:32,061
Doesn't it ever creep
you out being around him?

203
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,479
Not really.

204
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:35,898
Dude. With those dead bodies?

205
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:41,153
<i>I'm pretty sure Ely keeps
them in the funeral home.</i>

206
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,538
Mr. Ely?

207
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:54,333
- Boo!
- I'm all done.

208
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,424
Here.

209
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:16,689
Travis, you didn't set
the mower low enough.

210
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,273
I thought I did it the way you wanted.

211
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,193
What I said on the last cutting...

212
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:23,403
is that I wanted it really low...

213
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:25,738
so that it looks good until spring.

214
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,950
Now, wasn't that clear?

215
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,159
I guess.

216
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:34,456
Well, you just have to do
it over again, that's...

217
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,833
Yes, sir.

218
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,424
You know, uh...

219
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,926
my dear wife, Rosemary...

220
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,138
taught your sister...

221
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,930
um, what was her... Ellen?

222
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,391
Erin.

223
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:55,978
Erin. Taught her in the sixth grade.

224
00:11:56,061 --> 00:12:01,316
Hm. Yeah.

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,738
Here you go, just put it right in here.

226
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:10,784
Said she was a really smart young lady.

227
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:15,789
Very special.

228
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:20,586
Now they're both gone.

229
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:21,837
Here, back to work.

230
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:40,272
Hey, Travis.

231
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,149
Hey.

232
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,860
So, Danny said that you
weren't gonna go tonight.

233
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,987
Yeah, got some homework to do.

234
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,407
Travis, you can do
homework whenever you want.

235
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:58,498
So...

236
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:00,709
So what?

237
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:05,004
It's just... that you promised that...

238
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:09,718
you would tell me about
the whole ghost thing.

239
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:14,056
I just... don't want this
getting around school.

240
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,849
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

241
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,851
I promise.

242
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:24,190
<i>[Travis, off? One night,
when I was seven years old.</i>

243
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,694
<i>Some strange noises woke me up.</i>

244
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,031
<i>They were coming from my sister's room.</i>

245
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,739
Erin?

246
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:24,710
Erin?

247
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:39,725
Erin.

248
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:46,481
Leave my sister alone!

249
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,443
<i>My mom
called 9-1-1.</i>

250
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:50,944
<i>I knew there was nothing they could do.</i>

251
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:54,781
Don't go, Erin. Please don't go.

252
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:57,492
<i>I knew she was gone</i>

253
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:00,662
I'm sorry, Travis.

254
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:05,334
I just stood there.

255
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,017
Frozen.

256
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:13,300
<i>I'm sure you couldn't have
changed anything if you tried...</i>

257
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,349
She'd be 21 now.

258
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,314
Our minister came over that night...

259
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:31,026
to try to comfort my mom...

260
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:33,653
try to make her not feel guilty...

261
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:37,366
that this was meant to be.

262
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,076
What kind of crap is that?

263
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,704
Did you try and tell
your mom what happened?

264
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:46,375
<i>Yeah.</i>

265
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,629
First she believed me, then, um...

266
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:56,885
it was just to calm me down.

267
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:59,137
I wonder if my mom
would even believe me...

268
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,181
if I told her I saw something like that.

269
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:10,022
Probably not.

270
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:11,358
But I'm glad you told me.

271
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:47,393
Hear it not, Duncan, is a knell...

272
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,187
or for hell.

273
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,273
Something like that.

274
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:55,569
Thou hath made me
drunk, hath made me bold.

275
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,654
Um.... Hmm.

276
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:00,866
Well, at least it seems like
we have the majority of it down.

277
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,701
Yeah. You do, anyway.

278
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:21,427
Oh, El Camino! God, I'm awesome.

279
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,471
Your car is not that nice.

280
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,306
My car is amazing.

281
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,640
That will take you any day.

282
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:26,850
No. No, it will not.

283
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,060
<i>El Camino is king.</i>

284
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,352
Yo, it's the Macbeth's.

285
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:32,272
Ha, ha, how are you guys?

286
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,649
You guys are really into
this acting thing, huh?

287
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,319
I am too. The ghost,
in... in the play...

288
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:39,112
he gets stabbed by Macbeth, right?

289
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:41,614
Well, Macbeth had him killed.

290
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,909
Perfect. I'll play the ghost.

291
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,452
You want to play the ghost?

292
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,413
Yeah.

293
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,416
Yeah. Sure, why not?

294
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,252
Right? No, I can come on
with the ketchup on my head...

295
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,421
and then at the end,
I will lick the blood.

296
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:59,591
Oh, sort of like a Buffy
Macbeth kind of thing.

297
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,510
Hell, yes.

298
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,595
Okay, all right. That
sounds great. Can we go?

299
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,847
I want to get to Chestnut
Square before it gets late.

300
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:09,643
Yeah.

301
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,477
Abby? Back by ten.

302
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,312
<i>Leave your cell phone on.</i>

303
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,397
Yes, Mom.

304
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,649
Thank you. Brian.

305
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:17,859
Hey.

306
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,986
One passenger at a time with
that new license of yours, please.

307
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,447
Of course, Mrs. Harwood.

308
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,575
And I always take good
care of my passenger.

309
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,077
Thank you, Brian.

310
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,954
I love that sweater, Mrs. Harwood.

311
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:31,997
Okay, Danny.

312
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,503
Your mom's so hot, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,340
Really? That's my mother.

314
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,384
Come on.

315
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,008
She's hot. What's with the
be back by ten shit, though?

316
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,053
Don't get me started.

317
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:46,680
That's early.

318
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:48,181
Come on, Abby.

319
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:49,724
You got one more strike.

320
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,476
Let's see if you can do it.

321
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,978
Don't you listen to
him, Abby, all right?

322
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,187
He's just trying to psych you out.

323
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,522
Watch and learn, Brian.

324
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:57,899
You get it, girl.

325
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,569
Go, go! go!

326
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:06,241
I'm pretty sure I just won.

327
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,410
Just saying.

328
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:09,619
Travis, did the bowling ghost

329
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:10,912
knock the pins over?

330
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,664
That's not really funny.

331
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,205
It's just a joke. Calm down.

332
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:15,500
Just get out of my face.

333
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:16,751
Whoa, hey dude.

334
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,336
Calm down. Brian...

335
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,005
No, no, I'm the victim here, okay?

336
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,257
It's his fault. We're just bowling here.

337
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,217
<i>We are just bowling.</i>

338
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,719
All right, I'll stop, I'll stop.

339
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,137
Sit down.

340
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,221
<i>I don't wanna sit down.</i>

341
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:29,181
<i>You sit down.</i>

342
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:30,390
<i>Brian.</i>

343
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,266
Have you seen them?

344
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,851
No, no.

345
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,853
Real ghosts? Like just dancing around?

346
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,354
Colin saw them when he was walking by.

347
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:37,814
He said they were all shimmering.

348
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,441
Can you guys lay off already?

349
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:41,276
My God! We're not talking about Travis.

350
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,695
Jesus. Okay, so where did
Colin see these things?

351
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:45,530
Outside, in the front lawn.

352
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:47,365
He said they drifted
in through a wall...

353
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:49,117
and he could see them
through the window.

354
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,204
That is complete horse shit.

355
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,788
I know. It's what he said.

356
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:54,789
Who's house is this at?

357
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:55,999
Vaughn Ely's.

358
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,500
Travis mows his lawn.

359
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,336
I've never seen anything like that.

360
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:00,629
You mow his lawn during the day.

361
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:02,505
Ghosts come out at night.

362
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,965
It's probably Ely walking around...

363
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:04,925
with a sheet on top of his head.

364
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:08,803
So wanna go check it out?

365
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,096
Really?

366
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,765
Really.

367
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:13,099
No, no, no. You are
not driving this car.

368
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,061
Brian. Give me the keys.

369
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,562
All right, let's go!

370
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,943
<i>Oh, it's so dark tonight. Oooh...</i>

371
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:25,277
<i>S0 what's Ely's deal?</i>

372
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,239
He's all right.

373
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:29,616
He's a freakin' weirdo, man.

374
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,076
You gotta be if you're...

375
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:33,078
one of those, uh, "morticianers?"

376
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,663
Yeah, yeah, morticianer.

377
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,790
Yeah, that... that guy.

378
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:39,123
Sticking those tubes in people
and sucking all that snot out.

379
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,335
That's gross, Brian.

380
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:41,961
Oh, you're welcome.

381
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,546
Was he married to the mayor's sister?

382
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,632
Yeah, but she died a couple years back.

383
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,842
What does he pay you to mow his lawn?

384
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,344
Twenty bucks.

385
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,012
Twenty... twenty bucks, that's it?

386
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:52,847
Yeah, I mean, I only mow the front.

387
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,349
Why?

388
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,725
He never lets me in the back yard.

389
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,185
I figure he does it himself.

390
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,062
That's weird.

391
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,022
I would completely believe
this house is haunted.

392
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:03,149
It gives off such a weird vibe.

393
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,026
I think you just like
to be scared, Abby.

394
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,653
<i>Brian.</i>

395
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:08,822
<i>No, seriously.</i>

396
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:11,199
No, Brian, look.

397
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:12,534
Shit.

398
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:17,830
<i>See? I told you.</i>

399
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,458
He lives alone, right?

400
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,210
<i>Yeah.</i>

401
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,504
<i>Yeah, so who is that?</i>

402
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,966
This house is so haunted.

403
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,220
Nobody's gonna believe this.

404
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:33,847
I'm still not convinced.

405
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,681
Brian, we all saw it.

406
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:37,517
Maybe one was Ely, but
the other one was...

407
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,311
How do we know it was a freakin' ghost?

408
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,937
Then what was it, Brian?

409
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,480
I don't know, maybe Ely had a hot date.

410
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,399
You know, he was dancing with her...

411
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:45,859
before he mixed the milkshake.

412
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,693
It was not a hot date.

413
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:50,739
It was just... something wrong.

414
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,699
Well, maybe if she was a ghost...

415
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,242
she'll show up in class in a second.

416
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:59,205
Give that Macbeth ghost some company.

417
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,416
Are you a man?

418
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:03,835
Aye. And a bold one...

419
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:07,547
that dare look on that
which might appall the devil.

420
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,341
<i>A shame itself.</i>

421
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:11,593
Why do you make such faces?

422
00:22:11,676 --> 00:22:14,429
When all's done, you
look but on a stool.

423
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:17,057
Prithee, see there!

424
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,100
Behold! Look! Look! How say you?

425
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,063
If charnel houses and graves
send those that we bury back

426
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,690
then our monuments shall
be the maws of kites.

427
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,385
Asshole.

428
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:56,971
You know I don't like that.

429
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:59,391
I know that grade's shit, but who cares?

430
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:00,392
I do.

431
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,769
Travis, wait.

432
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,271
Why aren't you trying?

433
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,607
Honestly? Cause I don't give a shit.

434
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,402
Well, wh... what do you care about?

435
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:12,070
Maybe if Erin were...

436
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:13,488
<i>No, no, just say it! Say it!</i>

437
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:17,826
If Erin was still alive...

438
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:21,454
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

439
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,999
You know, Mom, people die every day.

440
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,335
You can't change it.

441
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,003
And you sure as hell can't change me.

442
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:43,809
What's up?

443
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,354
<i>It's Vaughn Ely, what's
the word on my van?</i>

444
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,106
Vaughn, I hate to tell you.

445
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:49,649
It's the torque converter.

446
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:52,527
Well, how much is it gonna cost?

447
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,362
<i>It'll be close to 1500...</i>

448
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,115
1500 dollars?

449
00:23:57,198 --> 00:24:01,327
How come anytime anything goes wrong
with the car, it's 1500 dollars?

450
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:02,871
Now look, man, it is what it is.

451
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,330
You want me to fix it or not?

452
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,875
It's gotta be ready by Saturday.

453
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,378
How long on that van?

454
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:14,716
It's gonna be at least a week.

455
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,093
<i>Vaughn, it's gonna be tough...</i>

456
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:19,888
Alright, just have it done.

457
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,142
Yeah.

458
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:26,019
Yeah.

459
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:28,313
Yeah.

460
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:29,939
<i>You all did a great job
with the sonnets today.</i>

461
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:32,859
We have come a long
way with Shakespeare.

462
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:34,944
By the way, I won't be
here this afternoon...

463
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:37,906
so if you need anything, please
check with me after class.

464
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:38,865
Wait, where's she going?

465
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:41,159
Basher.

466
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:42,660
You know, her old man's
been missing for two years.

467
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:43,912
She's gonna get a divorce.

468
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,795
Hey, Travis? Can I speak
with you for a moment?

469
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:04,265
It's about your Macbeth exam paper.

470
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,642
I thought I got an A on that.

471
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,769
Actually you got a hundred.

472
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:09,895
The highest grade in the class.

473
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:11,481
Well, then what?

474
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:13,233
Well, that test proves
what you can do...

475
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:15,276
when you apply yourself.

476
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,112
But so far this semester
your grade is a D.

477
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:20,114
You didn't even turn in
that book report last week.

478
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,741
Guess what grade I had
to give you on that?

479
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:23,408
<i>Hmm.</i>

480
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,703
Travis, here's the deal.

481
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:27,288
You wanna work on
getting your grade up...

482
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,790
I'll help you.

483
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:31,459
But that's gotta be your decision.

484
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:34,546
Can I go now?

485
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:36,256
Go ahead.

486
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,639
Miss Moore...

487
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:47,433
Yes?

488
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:51,980
I'm sorry about your husband.

489
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:53,731
Thank you, Travis.

490
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:08,120
♫ Go, Orange! ♫

491
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:09,622
♫ Go, Black! ♫

492
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,958
Hey, sweetie.

493
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,625
Hi, Vaughn.

494
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:14,752
Sylvia.

495
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:15,960
How nice to see you.

496
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:17,255
Enjoying the game?

497
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:20,008
Oh, yes. I always enjoy it.

498
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:29,017
Down! Set!

499
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,310
Hut!

500
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,445
Go, Tigers!

501
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:47,994
Go, Tigers!

502
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,995
Woo!

503
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,123
You know, I think we
have our quarterback...

504
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:53,541
for this year and the next.

505
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,293
That Williams kid is good.

506
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,211
Yeah. He can fire the ball.

507
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:58,463
And he makes good decisions.

508
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,506
He's smart.

509
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,883
Sorta like you when you won
that state title back in, uh...

510
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,676
Don't go there. Too long ago.

511
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:07,847
Yeah, listen, Vaughn,
I wanted to tell you...

512
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,558
I really appreciate all your
work on the Booster Club...

513
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:13,852
especially after you lost Rosemary.

514
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:18,191
Yeah, my Rosemary. She
loved coming to the games.

515
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:21,903
We're just, I mean, I'm glad to do it.

516
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:25,573
I tell you, it makes a big difference
when there's a lot of fans out here.

517
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:32,246
<i>Tigers up by seven as
we head info halftime.</i>

518
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,209
Hey, look, there's Travis.

519
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,753
Hey.

520
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:40,713
You guys are looking good out there.

521
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:43,383
Thanks.

522
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,842
Why don't you come down?

523
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:47,719
Er...

524
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
alright.

525
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,562
So, Travis, you don't
normally go to football games.

526
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:58,106
Not usually.

527
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:00,274
Is there a reason you're at this one?

528
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:03,111
Well, I heard there was this
really good cheer leading team.

529
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:04,904
<i>I thought' I'd check them out.</i>

530
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:07,031
Cute, Travis. Real cute.

531
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:13,578
<i>Gotta say, man, it
was a beautiful throw.</i>

532
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:14,622
You are an amazing man.

533
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:16,207
Aw, well, thanks.

534
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,251
I still can't believe we saw a ghost.

535
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:20,128
We didn't see shit.

536
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:23,256
No, we didn't.

537
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,299
What's it gonna take to convince you?

538
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:28,302
Okay, first of all, we gotta
make sure Ely is not home...

539
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:31,097
and second of all, we gotta go back.

540
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:38,270
Okay, I've got an idea.

541
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,314
He only has one car, right?

542
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:42,316
Yeah, a funeral van.

543
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,444
Okay, so if the van's not
there, then Ely's not home.

544
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:46,487
Dude, isn't his garage in back?

545
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,990
No, he has another carport.
You can see if it's there.

546
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,783
- That'll work.
- But it's a bad idea.

547
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,201
No, that's a great idea.

548
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,619
I mow his lawn. He trusts me.

549
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:56,164
We can't spy on him.

550
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:59,250
Screw him. Let's go.

551
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:04,464
Alright.

552
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,362
Alright, so the van isn't there...

553
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,322
which means he's not home.

554
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:33,158
Guess what? The show started.

555
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,661
Unbelievable.

556
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:36,995
I'll say.

557
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,372
Now you're convinced?

558
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:39,874
I am convinced that something...

559
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:41,959
really freakin' weird is going on.

560
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:43,377
Gotta be ghosts.

561
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:44,837
<i>I wanna go see 'em.</i>

562
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:46,547
You are seeing them.

563
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,841
No, Danny, I mean I wanna
go see them up close.

564
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,343
Come on. Let's go, guys.

565
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,262
Abby, are you... are you kidding?

566
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:55,973
Danny's right, guys. Ely
could come home at any minute.

567
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,725
Are you scared, Travis?

568
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,060
Brian, don't.

569
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:00,728
No, I'm just curious.

570
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,396
He's our ghost expert
yet he's pussing out.

571
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,232
I just don't think it's right.

572
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,690
Oh, okay, that's cute.

573
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:07,359
Brian! Brian, just stop.

574
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,403
I need somebody to stand guard anyways.

575
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,322
Travis, if you see him pull up...

576
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:14,075
just come run and get us.

577
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:15,576
Alright, let's go.

578
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,869
We're doing it! Go!

579
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,788
Come on!

580
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:27,338
Let's go around the side.

581
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,434
Hey, genius. Window's open.

582
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:44,856
What about the screen?

583
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:46,524
I got it, I got it.

584
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,198
Got a criminal past that
I don't know about, Brian?

585
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:57,702
There's a lot you do not know about me.

586
00:30:57,785 --> 00:30:59,954
Okay, just go inside.

587
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:17,221
What is wrong with you?

588
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:20,224
Danny!

589
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,208
Did you hear that?

590
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,336
I don't hear anything.

591
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,339
That's the point. It stopped.

592
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:54,300
Maybe we better haul ass.

593
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:57,011
No, I wanna go upstairs.

594
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:58,596
Yeah, come on, let's go.

595
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,126
Hey, wait.

596
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,060
Danny.

597
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:47,645
Brian!

598
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:47,079
Oh my God.

599
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,456
She's dead.

600
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:49,874
Dead?

601
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:51,292
It's okay, it's fine.

602
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,002
It's not fine! This is crazy!

603
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:54,378
I know it is, but it's not my fault!

604
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:55,671
You're freakin' crazy!

605
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:56,797
Everyone was in on this!

606
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,716
Jesus Christ!

607
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,885
Vaughn.

608
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:04,055
Come on, let's go!

609
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,348
<i>What are you doing in my house?</i>

610
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:12,771
Uh...

611
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:15,608
This is bad.

612
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:18,444
It's bad.

613
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:20,527
Get out.

614
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,745
Go.

615
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,795
Run, you little shits!

616
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:38,296
Your friends left you. Are you scared?

617
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,508
Yeah.

618
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,510
Travis, we gotta go!

619
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:43,969
No, wait. Where's Danny?

620
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:45,804
Ely caught him! Travis, come on!

621
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,639
No! I'm not leaving him!

622
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,518
Travis! Travis!

623
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,770
<i>Please, stop!</i>

624
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:55,647
Mr. Ely, please. Just
let him go, please.

625
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:57,191
He didn't mean any harm.

626
00:34:57,274 --> 00:34:58,818
You want me to let him go?

627
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:01,986
Please.

628
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:04,532
Say please.

629
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,491
Please let me go.

630
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:08,327
Please let me go.

631
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,661
Okay.

632
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:24,718
Stairs can be very dangerous.

633
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:28,013
Most accidents happen in the home.

634
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:35,353
There, you little shit! Is
that clear enough for you?

635
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:36,939
What's going on?

636
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,023
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

637
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:39,567
Where's Danny?

638
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,402
Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Run!

639
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:44,280
<i>Where's Danny?</i>

640
00:35:46,031 --> 00:35:47,700
<i>9-1-1. State
your emergency.</i>

641
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,827
This is Vaughn Ely.

642
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,080
I need an ambulance and
the police right away.

643
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,584
There's... been a terrible accident.

644
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,044
I'll wait for them outside.

645
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:06,051
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

646
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,198
Now in a minute I'm
gonna let your folks in.

647
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,283
You're gonna be released
to their custody.

648
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,744
Wait, so we're not going to jail.

649
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,871
Well, you'll have to go
before a judge in the morning.

650
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:35,956
A lot depends on Mr. Ely.

651
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,459
He's the one who
should be going to jail.

652
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,251
Yeah, we have been through this.

653
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:42,087
Why don't you believe us?

654
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,755
Brian and I both saw that thing.

655
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,133
Young lady, we searched that house.

656
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:47,801
There was no dead body.

657
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,470
But we saw it and it was there.

658
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:50,679
It was up there on the bed.

659
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:52,181
Alright, kids, listen...

660
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:53,682
What about what happened to Danny?

661
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:55,226
Why don't you arrest Ely for that?

662
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:56,894
<i>You have Travis as a witness.</i>

663
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:58,979
In our investigation, we determined...

664
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:01,065
that Danny fell down those stairs.

665
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:02,900
He did not fall down the stairs, okay?

666
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:04,485
Ely pushed him and then
he stomped on his head.

667
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,903
Alright, listen.

668
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,488
Travis, I know you're scared.

669
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,073
But lying's gonna make it worse.

670
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:10,991
Well, I'm not lying.

671
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,577
And I'm not scared.

672
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:19,083
Come in.

673
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,501
Sarge, here it is.

674
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:23,629
Thank you.

675
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:26,257
All right, these are the
pictures we took in the bedroom.

676
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,175
You see a mannequin.
The closet door open...

677
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,301
and some sewing stuff in there.

678
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,594
That's not it.

679
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,221
That's not what we saw.

680
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:33,597
And you were nosing around...

681
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:35,182
you opened the closet door...

682
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:36,267
We didn't touch the door!

683
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,516
This is bullshit!

684
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:38,477
Watch your language.

685
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:43,774
What?

686
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:45,985
Sargeant, that was the hospital.

687
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:52,825
What?

688
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:58,205
I'm afraid your friend is dead.

689
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:11,719
These kids, when they do things,
they don't realize the consequences.

690
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:14,512
Phil, I... I know what goes on.

691
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:16,557
Kids make up stories about morticians.

692
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,059
I work with dead bodies.

693
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,478
It's all a big joke,
until somebody gets hurt.

694
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:23,814
I'm sure sad it had to happen.

695
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:27,026
It's tragic for everybody.

696
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:29,069
That boy's family...

697
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:31,405
I can't imagine what
they're going through.

698
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:32,448
Mm.

699
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:33,907
It's beyond me.

700
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,243
Vaughn, like I said...

701
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:40,497
you don't need to come on down there
if you're not pressing any charges.

702
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:44,418
Everybody's suffered enough.

703
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,545
You're a good man, Vaughn.

704
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:33,217
Honey-bunny.

705
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,140
There you are.

706
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:44,311
See, Rose?

707
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:50,401
I told you they wouldn't
find you up here, huh?

708
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:52,611
No. No, honey.

709
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,322
We have to stay here a few more days.

710
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:58,242
Just in case. Safety first.

711
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:01,662
All right?  Hm?

712
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:05,749
And then we're gonna
party like rock stars.

713
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,711
Nighty night.

714
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:14,842
<i>I'd like to talk for a second.</i>

715
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,760
There's nothing to talk about, Mom.

716
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:18,846
Police don't believe me,
you don't believe me, so...

717
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,514
tell me, what do you want to talk about?

718
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,807
I believe you.

719
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:24,393
Oh, bullshit.

720
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:26,478
No, this is the same
like when Erin died.

721
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:28,313
What?

722
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,482
You don't believe Ely
broke Danny's neck, do you?

723
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:35,028
Okay? For once in your life,
tell me the fucking truth! Please!

724
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:36,822
I love you so much.

725
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:41,368
I couldn't bear for
something to happen to you.

726
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:45,163
Please promise you'll never
go near Vaughn Ely again.

727
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,291
And you know why I
want you to promise me?

728
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:49,000
No.

729
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:51,836
Because I'm afraid.

730
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:56,383
I'm afraid what that man may do to you.

731
00:40:56,467 --> 00:41:01,345
Now does that sound like the truth?

732
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:03,390
Sorry I yelled.

733
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:07,352
So you promise me?

734
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:09,646
Danny was my best friend.

735
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,525
Oh, Travis. I know, honey.

736
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:15,527
We all loved him.

737
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:21,825
But please promise me.

738
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,285
I promise.

739
00:41:34,713 --> 00:41:37,424
I do believe...

740
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:40,219
we have you looking better...

741
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:43,347
than when you broke into my house.

742
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:36,567
May there be abundant
peace from heaven...

743
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,488
and light upon us and upon all Israel.

744
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,074
And say Amen.

745
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:57,754
May God comfort you...

746
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,758
along with the mourners
of Zion, Jerusalem.

747
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:11,351
<i>Travis, I'm so sorry.</i>

748
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:12,769
Thanks.

749
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:27,034
Did you get a chance to
talk to Danny's parents?

750
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:29,536
I went over there yesterday
and talked to them.

751
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,330
Have you guys noticed the way
everyone was staring at us?

752
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:34,332
It's like it's our fault.

753
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,959
They know how much we loved him.

754
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:37,919
Yeah, well, it's pissin' me off.

755
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:40,170
I mean, I know we weren't
supposed to be there, but...

756
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:41,548
we had some fun and
then this accident...

757
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:42,966
Accident?

758
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,384
Whatever.

759
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:45,886
No, I told you what happened.

760
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,179
He killed Danny. I told you.

761
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:49,013
Will you GUYS just stop.

762
00:43:49,014 --> 00:43:51,141
Nothing's ever your fault, is it?

763
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:53,727
I mean, it's always somebody else's.

764
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,312
I mean, don't you think we're all...

765
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:56,772
partially to blame for Danny's death?

766
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,023
To blame, yeah, okay, we...

767
00:43:58,106 --> 00:43:59,399
No, no, we did enough.

768
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:01,735
We never should've gone in.

769
00:44:01,818 --> 00:44:03,862
I thought this would be different.

770
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:07,407
I really did. That maybe
I could count on you.

771
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:08,659
Yeah? For what?

772
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:10,535
What do you think?

773
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,454
Help me prove he killed Danny.

774
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,216
I didn't kill anyone.

775
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:29,720
And I don't appreciate you spreading
gossip and rumors about me...

776
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:31,640
to make yourself look good.

777
00:44:31,723 --> 00:44:35,769
Oh, yeah? What the hell do
you think you're doing here?

778
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:38,939
It's my job.

779
00:44:39,022 --> 00:44:42,733
I'm still on the clock.

780
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:44,569
We know what you did, Ely.

781
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:48,824
Abby? Careful.

782
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,743
Man, that guy creeps me out.

783
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:56,581
The guy's more than just a creep.

784
00:44:56,665 --> 00:45:00,460
Travis.

785
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:02,379
You can count on me.

786
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,483
Mr. Harwood.

787
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,360
Travis, she's grounded.

788
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,945
I'm just wondering if I
could maybe talk to her.

789
00:45:27,946 --> 00:45:29,865
Travis, it's late.

790
00:45:29,948 --> 00:45:32,659
I think she still has some
homework she needs to finish.

791
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:37,664
<i>Dad, I finished all my home work.</i>

792
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:42,252
We'll just be on the porch.

793
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:45,589
Alright. For a little while.

794
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,264
Well, I'm not your
dad's favorite person.

795
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:59,186
I'll bet your mom's
not terribly fond of me.

796
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:02,147
Well, Abby, um...

797
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,693
I know. We broke into the house.

798
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:11,865
We didn't do anything
to cause Danny's death.

799
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:16,286
We shouldn't feel guilty
for what Ely did to him.

800
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:19,498
It's not our fault.

801
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,500
You're right.

802
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,169
It's not your fault.

803
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:27,547
But it's different for
me because I was there.

804
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:32,010
I saw it.

805
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:36,013
And I didn't do a damn thing about it.

806
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:37,724
Just like Erin.

807
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:42,229
I mean, if I'd done something...

808
00:46:42,312 --> 00:46:44,981
You went in there.

809
00:46:45,065 --> 00:46:46,525
You tried to help Danny.

810
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:50,028
And he's dead.

811
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,824
Travis, did you have any idea...

812
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:55,325
<i>what Ely would do
when he re-ache-d..</i>

813
00:46:55,408 --> 00:46:57,701
<i>The bottom of the stairs?</i>

814
00:46:57,702 --> 00:46:59,371
What do you mean?

815
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:01,915
Did you know he was
gonna break Danny's neck?

816
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:04,041
Well, I mean, it happened so fast.

817
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:09,422
See? That's what I'm saying.

818
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:16,096
You didn't have a chance to react.

819
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:24,354
The guts to go in when nobody else did.

820
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:26,022
And I'm proud of you for that.

821
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:41,621
Thank you.

822
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:48,753
Abby. It's getting late.

823
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:51,131
<i>Good night, Travis.</i>

824
00:48:16,114 --> 00:48:20,243
<i>Pile just keeps growing.</i>

825
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:26,249
Looks like everybody brought something.

826
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,918
It's not gonna bring him back.

827
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,640
Abby, they all believe Ely.

828
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:44,726
But if we can prove he's crazy or...

829
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:47,646
He's a total psychopath, and
we're the only ones who know it.

830
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,814
What if we had a photo of that body?

831
00:48:49,898 --> 00:48:52,150
Then they'd have to believe
us or at least ask questions.

832
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,486
She's definitely not a mannequin.

833
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:56,071
But where is she?

834
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:57,614
I bet she's back in the bedroom.

835
00:48:57,697 --> 00:48:59,199
Why would he put her back?

836
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:01,325
Who knows? He's weirder than shit.

837
00:49:01,326 --> 00:49:06,706
For some reason, he
likes her in that bedroom.

838
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,961
I'm going in tonight.

839
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:12,671
You're not going in without me.

840
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,047
Yeah, I am.

841
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,799
Travis, don't be all macho...

842
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:17,676
and try to tell me
what I can and can't do.

843
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:18,969
I know you want to help
but it's not gonna happen.

844
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:20,220
I'm not...

845
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:26,518
Travis! Just shut up.

846
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:29,896
Okay.

847
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,232
Compromise.

848
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:36,194
You can be my lookout.

849
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:13,606
Okay, we've been here
over an hour, Travis.

850
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,398
I don't think he's
going anywhere tonight.

851
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:16,443
Give it a few more minutes.

852
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:19,404
How'd you get out of your house?

853
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:21,156
I told my mom I'm at Karen's.

854
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,574
She's having this like
slumber party thing.

855
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:25,118
I thought you were grounded.

856
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,037
I am but I convinced her to let me out.

857
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,789
I'm kind of on parole.

858
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,748
Anyway, I left my phone at Karen's.

859
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:33,376
So I told her that if anybody calls...

860
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,128
just to tell them I'm in the shower.

861
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:45,638
<i>Look.</i>

862
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,456
I guess now's our chance.

863
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:12,457
Yeah. Come on.

864
00:51:16,669 --> 00:51:18,671
No, you can't do that.
It's padlocked, come on.

865
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:20,757
Let's go.

866
00:51:28,473 --> 00:51:30,433
Come on. You can do it.

867
00:51:33,978 --> 00:51:35,438
<i>Can you make it over the fence...</i>

868
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:36,856
<i>if we have to get out fast?</i>

869
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,358
<i>Yeah. I can.</i>

870
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:41,986
This house is so creepy.

871
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,738
No shit.

872
00:51:43,822 --> 00:51:45,365
We just need to get in
and get out before...

873
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:47,951
You okay?

874
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:49,285
What was that?

875
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:50,954
I don't know.

876
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:54,999
You're kidding me.

877
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:04,217
<i>You know, I'll bet...</i>

878
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,510
<i>Travis...</i>

879
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:17,397
Alright, come on.

880
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,940
Oh, God.

881
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:23,987
Remember, stick to the plan.

882
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,574
Get in and get out and take a picture.

883
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:29,159
Look, just stay here, okay?

884
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:31,119
If you see anything or hear anything...

885
00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:32,537
you get out. Don't wait for me.

886
00:52:32,538 --> 00:52:35,915
What if we get separated?

887
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,667
<i>I'll find you.</i>

888
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,185
Thanks for being you.

889
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:57,770
Just hurry, Travis.

890
00:54:20,603 --> 00:54:22,397
Come on, Travis.

891
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:32,782
<i>Damn it.</i>

892
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:57,807
Yoo-hoo.

893
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:01,644
Where is she?

894
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,353
Well, that depends.

895
00:55:03,354 --> 00:55:05,398
If you're talking about Rosemary...

896
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:07,150
don't worry about her. She's safe.

897
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,693
<i>But if you're talking about Abby.</i>

898
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:12,030
Uh, I don't know.

899
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:13,990
What did you do to her? Tell me!

900
00:55:14,073 --> 00:55:17,994
Travis, you're in no
position to be making demands.

901
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:21,914
You are a burglar... and this is Texas.

902
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:25,709
And in Texas, we can shoot burglars.

903
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:30,214
You killed my best friend.

904
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:31,758
You're fucking crazy.

905
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,846
Are you scared now?

906
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:37,847
No!

907
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:47,190
Abby! Abby!

908
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:23,768
Shit.

909
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:41,953
I chased him out through here...

910
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:44,497
and I took a shot at him as
he was going over the fence.

911
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,665
Is that his flashlight?

912
00:56:45,748 --> 00:56:47,250
<i>No, that's mine</i>

913
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,835
I dropped it when I... Thank you.

914
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:50,128
Came out.

915
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,844
Don't worry, Vaughn. We'll
find him. He won't get far.

916
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:08,146
You were a great wide receiver.

917
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:09,689
You caught everything I threw to you.

918
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:11,023
Yeah, well man, we were a good pair.

919
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:12,358
Yeah.

920
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:14,485
Broke a lot of records.

921
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:16,779
So you took one more shot...

922
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:21,825
as he ran for the fence.

923
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:25,662
Yeah, I probably
shouldn't have done that.

924
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:28,458
I mean, that was twice in one week.

925
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,376
Yeah, yeah.

926
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,211
<i>Shooting them in the
house is one thing...</i>

927
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:33,713
but you don't shoot
a burglar in the back.

928
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:36,007
Especially outside.

929
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,884
<i>You're lucky you didn't
hit the neighbors.</i>

930
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:40,219
I was upset.

931
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:41,971
I was scared, really.

932
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:48,978
It's enough to get you frazzled.

933
00:57:56,527 --> 00:57:58,863
Hey, Vaughn...

934
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:01,240
what are you doing with this tarp?

935
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:04,868
I'm putting in a tomato patch.

936
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:07,705
It helps, uh, kill the grass.

937
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:10,541
<i>Tomato patch, hm.</i>

938
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:16,255
You're going green.

939
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,717
Hm.

940
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,886
Let me ask you something.

941
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:25,388
Does this work pretty quickly?

942
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:29,727
Yeah. You just spread out the tarp...

943
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,272
and in a couple of
days, everything's dead.

944
00:58:54,919 --> 00:59:00,466
I'm definitely gonna have
to get me one of these.

945
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:10,267
You wanna see where
he went over the fence?

946
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:12,395
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

947
00:59:58,482 --> 00:59:59,483
No!

948
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:02,653
<i>No, no, no!</i>

949
01:00:10,828 --> 01:00:15,041
In my haste, I forgot to lock the box.

950
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:18,044
Totally my fault.

951
01:00:18,127 --> 01:00:21,714
Gets dark in there, doesn't it?

952
01:00:21,797 --> 01:00:23,716
You want a night light?

953
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,845
Here. Take it.

954
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:30,514
Don't be rude. Take it.

955
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:35,019
See you later.

956
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:49,075
<i>Open!</i>

957
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:06,884
What happened to you, son?

958
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:10,262
I fell on one of those...

959
01:01:10,346 --> 01:01:13,724
those things that stick out of the
cement that are really sharp on...

960
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:14,892
Rebar.

961
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,727
Rebar?

962
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:19,397
Yeah, those steel rods,
they call them rebar.

963
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,565
Oh. Yeah.

964
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:25,236
Travis, this is a local anesthetic.

965
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,613
I need to get you numb
so I can close the wound.

966
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,788
Don't worry.

967
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,374
You won't feel a thing
when he sews you up.

968
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,754
<i>Dr. Walker...</i>

969
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:46,215
<i>It's not you fault, you know.</i>

970
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:49,593
What did you say?

971
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:51,595
I said it's not your fault.

972
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,640
They leave rebar sticking
up all over the place.

973
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:09,447
<i>Travis, are you all right?</i>

974
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,493
<i>It's not your fault, Travis.</i>

975
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,037
<i>It's her time.</i>

976
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:23,294
Well, it's not Abby's time.

977
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:26,672
What's that? Are you okay?

978
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:30,134
It wasn't the minister
talking to my mother.

979
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:32,303
He was trying to tell me.

980
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:39,810
Travis, when your mother gets here,
you're gonna tell her the truth.

981
01:02:39,894 --> 01:02:42,855
I know a gunshot wound when I see one.

982
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,318
<i>That lie you told...</i>

983
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,612
don't you feel a little guilty?

984
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,283
I used to.

985
01:02:58,913 --> 01:03:01,707
Okay. Well, I will be right back.

986
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,001
Uh, actually, can I borrow your phone?

987
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:05,336
Yeah, sure.

988
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:06,921

01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:26,232
Abby's in trouble.

995
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:33,197
Thank God you weren't killed.

996
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,366
Mom.

997
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:38,369
Travis, listen to me. You don't
realize how serious this is.

998
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:40,704
Yes. I do.

999
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:44,708
Even if you don't believe me, you
have to tell them Ely has Abby.

1000
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:46,210
Travis, what are you gonna do?

1001
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:48,379
She may still be alive.

1002
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:50,381
If I'm gonna save her, I need to go now.

1003
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:52,424
God.

1004
01:03:52,508 --> 01:03:55,678
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not
so fast, Travis. Not so fast.

1005
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:59,515
Don't let him out of your sight.

1006
01:04:03,644 --> 01:04:07,106
Miss Penny, they're
gonna keep him overnight.

1007
01:04:07,189 --> 01:04:10,067
<i>The doctor's like to check
him out in the morning.</i>

1008
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:13,279
The DA is gonna charge
him with burglary.

1009
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:17,283
Later on they may
certify him as an adult.

1010
01:04:17,366 --> 01:04:19,076
Oh, dear God.

1011
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,954
Be a good idea to get a good lawyer.

1012
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:26,417
What about what Travis
said about the Harwood girl?

1013
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,628
Yeah, don't you worry. I'm
gonna check that out personally.

1014
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:31,463
Thank you.

1015
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:35,259
Phil?

1016
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:38,262
Hey, Russell. Ls-is Elaine in?

1017
01:04:38,345 --> 01:04:41,098
Yes. Elaine?

1018
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,933
Has there been an accident?

1019
01:04:43,017 --> 01:04:44,935
Oh, no, no. There's not an accident.

1020
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:47,438
There's just a boy. A juvenile
got arrested tonight...

1021
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:49,440
and he said that Abby was with him.

1022
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:51,775
I don't put much stock
in what this kid says...

1023
01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:55,279
but I need to make
sure that Abby's safe.

1024
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:58,282
Yes, she's at her friend's
spending the night.

1025
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:01,118
I'll call and make sure
she's over there. Okay?

1026
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,287
Thank you.

1027
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,164
Sorry to disturb you so late.

1028
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:08,500
<i>Hi. This is Abby's mom. Is she...</i>

1029
01:05:08,584 --> 01:05:10,461
<i>No, no, no, that's okay...</i>

1030
01:05:10,544 --> 01:05:12,129
<i>Don't get her out of the shower.</i>

1031
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:14,298
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

1032
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:17,468
She's there. I... everything's
fine. I talked to her friend.

1033
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:20,846
Good, good. You know, like I said,
I didn't think there was much to it.

1034
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,640
So, y'all have a nice evening.

1035
01:05:22,723 --> 01:05:23,849
You, too.

1036
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:25,392
Thank you.

1037
01:05:31,732 --> 01:05:33,651
Officer Alvarez. Hey.

1038
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:36,820
Brian. I know he's your
friend but you can't go in.

1039
01:05:36,904 --> 01:05:38,489
I just wanted to see how he's doing.

1040
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:39,990
He's okay.

1041
01:05:40,074 --> 01:05:41,992
Yeah? Did you see him?

1042
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:44,370
Yeah, the wound is on the
side. It's not bad at all.

1043
01:05:46,622 --> 01:05:49,833
Hey, uh, did you hear we're...
we're undefeated this year?

1044
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:52,169
Yeah. Angie told me that.

1045
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:54,505
Yeah. You know, she's at every game.

1046
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:57,341
She told me you've thrown
a touchdown in every game.

1047
01:05:57,424 --> 01:06:00,344
I don't know how I do it, but yeah.

1048
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:02,846
Well, tell Angie I said hey, okay?

1049
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,516
<i>Sure
- I'll tell him.</i>

1050
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,851
You know, I know it's a lot to ask...

1051
01:06:07,935 --> 01:06:10,729
but is there any way that I can
go in there for like half a second?

1052
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:13,190
Absolutely not, Brian. Positive.

1053
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:15,025
You're right. I'm sorry.

1054
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:16,485
Have a good one.

1055
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:21,657
Brian.

1056
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:27,705
You have one minute.

1057
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:28,998
Thanks.

1058
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,044
- Hi. So what happened?
- Ely got her.

1059
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:36,046
- Are you shitting me?
- No one believes me.

1060
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,048
It's gonna be morning till
they find out she's missing.

1061
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:40,384
Great. So, we gotta bust out of here.

1062
01:06:40,467 --> 01:06:42,052
Got any ideas to get past him?

1063
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:43,679
Yeah, I got a couple.

1064
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:48,225
Travis, look, what you said about me...

1065
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,227
No, no, you were right.

1066
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,397
I pushed everyone to go
in there and I screwed up.

1067
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,399
No.

1068
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:57,151
We screwed up.

1069
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:02,239
Hey there.

1070
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,783
He says it's starting to hurt.

1071
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:08,746
I guess they numbed it when they stitched
him up, but I think it's wearing off.

1072
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,581
Could be, yeah.

1073
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:12,916
<i>You think the nurse'll
give him something?</i>

1074
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,752
<i>I bet they already have.</i>

1075
01:07:14,835 --> 01:07:17,254
Yeah, that's right.
It's down here, right?

1076
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:19,214
<i>Dammit, kid.</i>

1077
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:25,387
Three-oh-four in
dispatch. I got a run.

1078
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,309
<i>He got to the stairs before...</i>

1079
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:32,269
<i>- I could grab him
- What?</i>

1080
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,271
<i>He got' to the stairs
before I could grab him.</i>

1081
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:35,773
Who, Alvarez?

1082
01:07:35,856 --> 01:07:39,151
<i>Travis. I'm sorry, Sarge.</i>

1083
01:07:39,234 --> 01:07:42,946
We're a couple blocks away. We'll cut
him off and we'll come around the back.

1084
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:05,010
All right, Jesse, check it out.

1085
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,524
Travis. Travis!

1086
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:20,526
<i>Travis, you come here.</i>

1087
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:25,239
Get in!

1088
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:31,161
He's going left. He's going left.

1089
01:08:31,245 --> 01:08:33,455
<i>I'll take it around the block. I got it.</i>

1090
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:56,061
The game's over, Travis.

1091
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:58,355
<i>Don't move, kid. You hear me?</i>

1092
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:00,190
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

1093
01:09:00,274 --> 01:09:01,984
<i>Woo, you guys totally saved my butt.</i>

1094
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:04,695
<i>Damn.</i>

1095
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:06,029
Son of a bitch.

1096
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:08,907
<i>Dammit, Brian.</i>

1097
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,368
Ls Charlie working the parade tonight?

1098
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:14,371
Get on the horn. Tell him to look
for a kid who has a bloody T-shirt on.

1099
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,748
All right, Brian. What
were you and Travis up to?

1100
01:09:16,832 --> 01:09:18,750
He's gotta fake left two sweep right.

1101
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:22,754
Usually a good gainer
if I can sell the fake.

1102
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:25,507
Wha... Take him to the station.

1103
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:30,429
<i>We're looking for a
kid in a bloody T-shirt.</i>

1104
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:33,056
At the parade. Hold.

1105
01:10:01,376 --> 01:10:04,379
<i>Hey, hey. Hey, you.</i>

1106
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:05,607
Please be all right.

1107
01:11:08,902 --> 01:11:12,030
<i>Ooh-hoo.</i>

1108
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,157
She's not in there.

1109
01:11:14,241 --> 01:11:16,827
Where is she?

1110
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,997
Travis.

1111
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,374
You're a caution.

1112
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:24,668
You know what a caution is?

1113
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:26,837
It's a troublemaker.

1114
01:11:29,256 --> 01:11:31,675
So, you and I...

1115
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:33,176
we're gonna do a little job.

1116
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,178
Put your hands behind your back.

1117
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:37,514
You wanna help me on a
little job, don't you, Travis?

1118
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:39,683
What freaking job?

1119
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:42,853
You're just a typical teenager,
aren't you? Just mention work...

1120
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:48,900
Where the hell is Abby?

1121
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:51,194
What are you, in love
with her or something?

1122
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:54,031
I think you have a crush on her.

1123
01:11:54,114 --> 01:11:56,908
Stand up. Come on.

1124
01:11:56,992 --> 01:11:59,911
About face. Let's go.

1125
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:09,755
Phil, you don't really think he's
gonna come back here again, do you?

1126
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:11,715
What if he did?

1127
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:15,719
Vaughn might be just a tab
bit upset, don't you think?

1128
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:22,017
Vaughn.

1129
01:12:29,024 --> 01:12:30,817
It's Phil Nickerson.

1130
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:38,533
I don't know. Maybe he
went out with someone.

1131
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:42,913
Yeah. Lights are on.

1132
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:44,915
Nobody's home.

1133
01:12:44,998 --> 01:12:46,583
I don't like this.

1134
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,418
<i>I'm gonna check around the back.</i>

1135
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:11,775
<i>Vaughn?</i>

1136
01:13:13,068 --> 01:13:14,486
<i>Vaughn.</i>

1137
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:19,116
Sshhh.

1138
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,243
<i>Vaughn, its Nickerson.</i>

1139
01:13:42,764 --> 01:13:44,891
Everything looks okay.

1140
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:48,520
Let's go.

1141
01:13:51,064 --> 01:13:53,650
You set up the town, son.

1142
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:54,985
Come on.

1143
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:56,820
I got a surprise for you.

1144
01:13:56,903 --> 01:13:58,989
You can see now.

1145
01:13:59,072 --> 01:14:00,782
Both of our girls.

1146
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:03,827
Get in.

1147
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,580
Get in. There you go.

1148
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,002
Everyone nice and cozy.

1149
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:15,380
Brace yourself.

1150
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:25,015
Travis.

1151
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:27,726
I'm scared.

1152
01:14:27,809 --> 01:14:29,561
Me, too.

1153
01:14:40,113 --> 01:14:41,740
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1154
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:45,035
I don't know.

1155
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,041
He's not gonna let us go, is he?

1156
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:56,338
I don't think he lets people go, Abby.

1157
01:14:58,507 --> 01:15:00,425
I'm sorry.

1158
01:15:03,136 --> 01:15:05,180
You came back for me.

1159
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:10,560
Listen. You're gonna get out of here.

1160
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:12,604
Look at me. Look at me.

1161
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:14,231
You're gonna get out of here.

1162
01:15:14,314 --> 01:15:16,858
Bite the duct tape. Bite it.

1163
01:15:20,153 --> 01:15:23,114
Now, when you get out of here,
I want you to run for help...

1164
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:26,243
but he might come after you, so
stay off the main roads, okay?

1165
01:15:26,326 --> 01:15:29,079
You hear me? Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1166
01:15:29,162 --> 01:15:31,581
Okay? I'll find you.

1167
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:33,250
Okay?

1168
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,752
I'm not leaving you, Travis.

1169
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:38,630
Yes, you are. Now bite it. Go.

1170
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:40,090
Bite!

1171
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:37,022
Okay...

1172
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:39,691
Come on, Travis. We
got a little job to do.

1173
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:41,985
Let's go.

1174
01:16:42,068 --> 01:16:44,654
You're gonna need this.

1175
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:46,072
Come on.

1176
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:50,952
You girls sit tight.

1177
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:56,041
Right over here. Come on.

1178
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:07,844
Ah, man. I've done that up tight.

1179
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:10,180
Okay. Here you go.

1180
01:17:10,263 --> 01:17:12,140
All right.

1181
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:15,602
Dig. Right here.

1182
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:24,653
Dig faster.

1183
01:18:13,493 --> 01:18:15,286
Keep digging...

1184
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:32,053
Thank you for your patience, sweetheart.

1185
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:35,557
<i>Almost done.</i>

1186
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:23,480
<i>All right', that's enough.</i>

1187
01:19:23,563 --> 01:19:25,857
Put the shovel on the side.

1188
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:33,114
Open it.

1189
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,516
I'm a mortician and that makes me gag.

1190
01:20:02,769 --> 01:20:04,229
<i>Who is this?</i>

1191
01:20:04,312 --> 01:20:07,023
That's Jack, Travis.

1192
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:11,027
<i>The two of you are gonna be great
friends. You're gonna be roomies...</i>

1193
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,737
Who is this?

1194
01:20:14,447 --> 01:20:17,575
Oh, would... Yeah,
you're a junior, right?

1195
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:21,037
<i>Si! via Moore is your English teacher.</i>

1196
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:25,208
That's Silvia's long lost husband, Jack.

1197
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:32,715
Why did you put him in there?

1198
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:35,593
You're young, stupid...

1199
01:20:35,677 --> 01:20:38,054
so you don't know these things, okay?

1200
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:41,391
When another man fucks your wife...

1201
01:20:41,474 --> 01:20:43,101
<i>there's gotta be some payback.</i>

1202
01:20:43,184 --> 01:20:45,144
You have to punish him.

1203
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,234
I had to punish my Rosemary, too...

1204
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:53,111
and that broke my heart.

1205
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:56,614
But she asked for forgiveness...

1206
01:20:56,698 --> 01:20:59,242
and I have a soft spot
for those that I love...

1207
01:20:59,325 --> 01:21:02,537
so I told her that she
could stay home with me.

1208
01:21:06,332 --> 01:21:09,294
But she's dead.

1209
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:11,754
Oh, we had a funeral.

1210
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,465
I put a casket in the
ground but she wasn't in it.

1211
01:21:14,549 --> 01:21:17,594
Jack there, Jack was at the funeral.

1212
01:21:17,677 --> 01:21:20,597
He just sat there the
whole time looking at me...

1213
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,767
like I had no idea that
he was screwing my wife.

1214
01:21:24,851 --> 01:21:27,312
Joke's on you.

1215
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:30,773
Ha-ha.

1216
01:21:30,857 --> 01:21:35,612
<i>Rose, she and I are doing fine...</i>

1217
01:21:35,695 --> 01:21:38,031
Never better.

1218
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:42,285
Until you came along...

1219
01:21:42,368 --> 01:21:44,120
causing all that trouble.

1220
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,831
You're a psycho. You know that?

1221
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,169
I'm love sick is what I am.

1222
01:21:51,252 --> 01:21:54,631
Because of you, I had to
put Rose into the ground...

1223
01:21:54,714 --> 01:21:58,468
until the shit storm that
you caused blows over.

1224
01:21:58,551 --> 01:22:02,805
<i>Now, get his maggot eating
ass out of there. Now.</i>

1225
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:06,351
Don't you make me do it or I'll
put a bullet in your head first.

1226
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,987
<i>Ashes to ashes.</i>

1227
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:19,822
<i>Shit to shit.</i>

1228
01:22:19,906 --> 01:22:21,282
<i>Dirty work, huh?</i>

1229
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:24,619
<i>You know, don't you worry.</i>

1230
01:22:24,702 --> 01:22:27,038
<i>I got a nice old spot'
picked out for you...</i>

1231
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,540
and Jackie here and
your little girlfriend.

1232
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:33,336
No.

1233
01:22:33,419 --> 01:22:37,340
Rosemary wouldn't like it.

1234
01:22:37,423 --> 01:22:40,551
<i>She knows what' you did to her.</i>

1235
01:22:40,635 --> 01:22:42,345
What are you talking about?

1236
01:22:42,428 --> 01:22:46,683
When you put her in
and you shut that lid...

1237
01:22:46,766 --> 01:22:49,352
and throw that dirt on
her, she's gonna hear it.

1238
01:22:49,435 --> 01:22:51,688
And you think she's gonna like it?

1239
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:55,191
No. She's gonna be pissed.

1240
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:59,028
Rosemary understands
it's only temporary.

1241
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:01,239
Oh, does she?

1242
01:23:01,322 --> 01:23:04,534
<i>Might be forever 'cause
she knows you don't mean it.</i>

1243
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:06,202
Shut up!

1244
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:07,537
She hates you.

1245
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,706
Shut up! Shut up...

1246
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:12,709
or I'll put a bullet in your
sorry little ass right now.

1247
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:22,301
How about you go ask her for yourself?

1248
01:23:23,803 --> 01:23:26,556
She's right behind you.

1249
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,683
<i>Oh, you think I'm joking? Look.</i>

1250
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,817
Rose?

1251
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:42,030
Vaughn, you don't know
what it was like...

1252
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:45,950
to die alone.

1253
01:23:48,327 --> 01:23:50,038
How do you live with yourself?

1254
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:53,458
Don't be hateful.

1255
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,503
<i>You're disgusting.</i>

1256
01:23:58,671 --> 01:24:00,089
I hate you.

1257
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:02,717
No. Don't be hateful.

1258
01:24:05,053 --> 01:24:07,138
I hate you.

1259
01:24:10,725 --> 01:24:12,393
I hate you.

1260
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,648
You're not my Rosemary.

1261
01:24:30,244 --> 01:24:31,788
Go to hell.

1262
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:42,256
Get in!

1263
01:24:44,383 --> 01:24:45,843
Die.

1264
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:47,428
No!

1265
01:24:54,227 --> 01:24:55,686
<i>Rose!</i>

1266
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:57,438
Help me! Help!

1267
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:22,880
Abby.

1268
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:21,606
Like I said on the phone...

1269
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:23,608
you're gonna be mighty proud.

1270
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:26,402
We are proud...

1271
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:28,779
of both of them.

1272
01:26:28,863 --> 01:26:31,240
<i>The kids did a really
smart thing out there.</i>

1273
01:26:31,324 --> 01:26:34,368
They came right here after it happened.

1274
01:26:35,995 --> 01:26:38,789
<i>By the time we dug him up...</i>

1275
01:26:38,873 --> 01:26:41,584
old Vaughn had been in
there over two hours.

1276
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:49,050
What are they gonna do with him now?

1277
01:27:03,898 --> 01:27:05,233
You know...

1278
01:27:07,693 --> 01:27:10,947
you came back for me.

1279
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,616
I guess that makes us even.

1280
01:27:15,868 --> 01:27:17,411
Come here.

1281
01:27:55,574 --> 01:27:58,744
<i>Woo-hoo. Hey!</i>

1282
01:28:00,788 --> 01:28:02,873
Hey!

1283
01:28:02,957 --> 01:28:05,126
I'm feeling better now.

1284
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:13,759
God. First chance I
get, I'm so out of here.

1285
01:28:17,138 --> 01:28:18,347
Huh?

1286
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:20,391
Hey!

1287
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:28,482
Ah. Huh?

1288
01:28:30,276 --> 01:28:31,861
Huh?

1289
01:28:37,116 --> 01:28:38,826
Love sucks.

1290
01:28:42,288 --> 01:28:44,332
<i>All right.</i>

1291
01:28:50,963 --> 01:28:55,384
<i>♫ Ah ah Ah ah ♫</i>
