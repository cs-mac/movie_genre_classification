1
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,440
Hi.

2
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,120
<i>- Good morning.
- Hello, I'm Carla Norris.</i>

3
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,680
I have an appointment
with Mrs. McEvoy.

4
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>Through the garden, please, miss.
I'll tell her you're on your way there.</i>

5
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,880
Thanks.

6
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
<i>Hello, Mrs. McEvoy? Douglas.
Your 8:00 is here.</i>

7
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
- Good morning.
- Miss Norris?

8
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,320
Yes.

9
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,400
<i>- Hello, I'm Evelyn McEvoy.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

10
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,240
<i>This midtown traffic.
I swear, I'll never get used to it.</i>

11
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
Shall we see the apartment?

12
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,320
Yes. Sure.

13
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,960
Central air conditioning.
Absolutely terrific kitchen.

14
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,160
- I love the view.
- Yes. It's an airy place.

15
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
<i>What is it that you do, Miss Norris?</i>

16
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm a book editor at Sutton.

17
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,480
- What a strange tub.
- I like tubs myself.

18
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,920
<i>This is a nice room for reading, isn't it?</i>

19
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
For reading?

20
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>Yes, it is, isn't it?</i>

21
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,920
<i>I've got two tickets for Pavarotti Friday.</i>

22
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,080
I hate Pavarotti.

23
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't care if I ever go to an opera
for the rest of my life. Or the ballet.

24
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,240
<i>What do you want me to do?
Meet another nice, charming man...</i>

25
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,840
<i>like Derek,
and wake up seven years later...</i>

26
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>- and realize I have no life?
- God, Carly, please.</i>

27
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,880
<i>- Look, why don't you get tickets to...
- Who?</i>

28
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,560
- Pearl Jam.
- Pearl Jam?

29
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,760
Yeah.

30
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
<i>You know, you're really being a putz.</i>

31
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,960
How am I going to meet any attractive
men if I have to do it by myself?

32
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
You love Pavarotti.

33
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,280
I am a putz.
I wasted seven years of my life.

34
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,640
- And I hate Pavarotti.
- Will you stop it?

35
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,280
You are ready for new adventures.

36
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,080
New horizons.
New lovers. New orgasms.

37
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
<i>- Well?
- I'm 35, I'm not 25.</i>

38
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,920
<i>I don't need a date,
I need a relationship.</i>

39
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,560
Preferably one
where something happens this time.

40
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
<i>Sure, but in case you've forgotten
how it works...</i>

41
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,160
<i>first you meet somebody,
then you have a relationship.</i>

42
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,760
<i>Oh, thank you, Dr. Ruth.</i>

43
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,360
<i>Do you work here, or do you just go
from office to office, offering advice?</i>

44
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,440
<i>Oh, will you take a look at Chapter 6?
I think I might have cut too deep.</i>

45
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,480
<i>Well, you didn't show it
to the author yet, did you?</i>

46
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

47
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
And?

48
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
<i>He said, "I'll discuss it with Carly."</i>

49
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
You cut too deep.

50
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
<i>Never show it to the author
before you give it to me first, okay?</i>

51
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,920
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

52
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm sure the cuts are good.

53
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,920
<i>And the author's a pussycat,
so don't worry about it. This is good.</i>

54
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Where are you
with the James Dean bio?

55
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,440
Marketing wants to up
the publishing date.

56
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,320
I'll be done with it
by the end of the weekend.

57
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,600
<i>You're a genius, Carly.</i>

58
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,120
<i>Sure, who wouldn't be
on your social schedule?</i>

59
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,800
There's a Mrs. McEvoy on line 1.
She says it's important.

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
- Do you want to talk to her?
- Yeah.

61
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,920
And Mr. Parsons called. He wants
to take you to lunch at L'Adagio.

62
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
That means I'm not getting my raise.

63
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>- Mrs. McEvoy.
- Good news, my dear.</i>

64
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
<i>- Your application's been approved.
- Already?</i>

65
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
<i>- Is that a problem?
- No.</i>

66
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,280
<i>No, I... I just didn't think
it would happen this fast.</i>

67
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
<i>Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

68
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,200
I am. I'm very excited. Thank you.

69
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,200
<i>Well, then,
we can get you in next week.</i>

70
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,040
<i>- Next week will be fine.
- Splendid.</i>

71
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
<i>- Goodbye.
- Bye.</i>

72
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
- There you go.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
Sure.

74
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,240
<i>Sorry I couldn't get the door
for you, Miss Norris.</i>

75
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
The movers will be here
in about an hour.

76
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,440
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,000
He didn't want a "thank you."
I think he wanted a tip.

78
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
<i>Well, he didn't get the door for me,
now, did he?</i>

79
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Sure didn't.

80
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
- Can I take one of these for you?
- I'm okay.

81
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
<i>Come on, I've got two free arms.</i>

82
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,160
You want me
to take this other one for you?

83
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>- No, I'm okay.
- You're sure?</i>

84
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
Okay.

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>I know the neighborhood
real well, so...</i>

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
if you want the lowdown
on stores and things like that...

87
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,760
<i>- I could...
- How's the market across the street?</i>

88
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760
It's okay.
The one over on 39th is cheaper.

89
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
Thanks.

90
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm not gonna ask you again
if I can bring this up for you.

91
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
- Good. Don't.
- Here you go.

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Thank you.

93
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

94
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,440
I will. Thank you.

95
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,680
You're right. These are getting heavy.

96
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,000
- Sorry. I'll see you.
- Bye.

97
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
<i>I need a check okay, register 3.</i>

98
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,560
<i>Check okay on register 3, please.</i>

99
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
You only have one thing.
Why don't you go ahead of me?

100
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,960
<i>Oh, well, good idea. Thanks.</i>

101
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm Gus Hale.

102
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
<i>You're moving in today, aren't you?</i>

103
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,080
<i>- Well, welcome to 113.
- Thanks.</i>

104
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm in 23-B.

105
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,840
- I'll take that for you.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>Hey, why are you walking here?</i>

107
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
<i>Forgive me,
I don't usually follow women around.</i>

108
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
<i>I'm not a dirty old man, really not.</i>

109
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>- Are you certain?
- Sometimes I wish I were, but I'm not.</i>

110
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,320
- Why do you wish you were?
- 'Cause it's boring when you're not.

111
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>You just really...
Well, you look like someone.</i>

112
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,920
Someone you like
or someone you dislike?

113
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
<i>Oh, no. I liked her a lot.</i>

114
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,320
What's really strange is...

115
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,880
she was in 20-B as well.

116
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
Naomi Singer.

117
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,960
<i>- When did she move?
- Well, she didn't. She...</i>

118
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,960
She jumped out the window.

119
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,440
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I've never had much goddamned tact.</i>

120
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,280
I tell you what.
I'm about to go off to Japan.

121
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,520
<i>Perhaps when I get back,
I can fill you in on all the gossip.</i>

122
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,040
- What are you gonna do there?
- I teach a class at NYU.

123
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,440
The Psychology of the Lens.

124
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,960
- "The Psychology of the Lens."
- Yes.

125
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,640
<i>I teach all aspects.
I mean, cameras, camcorders...</i>

126
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,920
I'm going over
to look at the latest technology.

127
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,960
<i>So, you like salacious gossip?</i>

128
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
<i>I make a great cappuccino, too.</i>

129
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Call me.

130
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,920
How can I call you
when I don't even know your name?

131
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,120
How can you not know my name
if you knew my apartment number?

132
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,320
Our doormen are spoiled.
$5 only gets you half the information.

133
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
Carly Norris.

134
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
You must have liked her an awful lot
to spend $5.

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,680
I did.

136
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,800
We were pals.

137
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,960
<i>- How's the market across the street?
- It's okay.</i>

138
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,480
<i>Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.</i>

139
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,600
<i>- Where do you live now?
- In the Village.</i>

140
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,120
<i>This will be quite a change.</i>

141
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,880
<i>Shall I show you
the rest of the apartment?</i>

142
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,240
<i>Have you grown tired of the Village?</i>

143
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,960
<i>Oh, I teach all aspects of it.
Cameras, camcorders...</i>

144
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
This way.

145
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,080
<i>Now, why don't you talk
to Lynn Nesbit about him?</i>

146
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,120
His last book didn't sell very well.
Perhaps he's getting itchy at Random.

147
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,400
Perhaps he's blaming their marketing
and not the thinness of his characters.

148
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,480
Perhaps you can convince Lynn
to alert him to the inadequacies...

149
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,200
<i>- of their marketing department.
- Are we negotiating, Alex?</i>

150
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,680
<i>Oh, I wouldn't call it that.</i>

151
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,520
<i>He's an attractive man, isn't he?</i>

152
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,960
<i>Alex, I ask you for a raise,
and you take me out to lunch...</i>

153
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
and try to set me up.

154
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,200
Jack Landsford.

155
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,040
<i>Shred of Evidence, Flesh and Blood,
police procedurals.</i>

156
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,240
He hasn't written anything
in five or six years...

157
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,040
<i>but he made so much off of
Flesh and Blood, he doesn't have to.</i>

158
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
He's got a ranch in Montana.

159
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,040
<i>- And speak of the devil.
- Hello, Alex.</i>

160
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,120
- How are you?
- All right.

161
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm the devil.

162
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,600
- Carla Norris.
- Hello.

163
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
You look familiar to me.

164
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
Maybe that's because
I live in your building.

165
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,760
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

166
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,160
<i>Jack, Carly is a big fan of yours.
She just loved Flesh and Blood.</i>

167
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
- Hey.
- I haven't read it.

168
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm sorry.

169
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,080
<i>- Here you are, sir.
- She hasn't read me.</i>

170
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,880
<i>Alex, why is it she hasn't read me?</i>

171
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
Everybody's read me. I'm easy to read.

172
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,400
<i>Well, I haven't.</i>

173
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,360
She has better taste than I thought.

174
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
<i>She'll read me, though.</i>

175
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
What if she doesn't like
what she reads?

176
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
<i>- Hi, Jack.
- You'll read me.</i>

177
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,480
I know you'll read me.
Because you have good taste.

178
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>You've lost her now, Jack.
She likes being in control.</i>

179
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,320
So do I.

180
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,520
- See you around the neighborhood.
- Yeah.

181
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,120
Alex.

182
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>I spend seven years in a bad marriage,
and you say I like being in control?</i>

183
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,560
<i>But you ended it, didn't you?</i>

184
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,440
No. No way.

185
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
No.

186
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,240
<i>Fuck both of you. You said $700, Mike.</i>

187
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,080
<i>Yeah, I know it's not fucking Vogue.
So what?</i>

188
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,200
<i>Well, it's your choice.</i>

189
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,160
<i>Look, I'm hungry, I'm jet-lagged, and
I don't need this shit. Goodbye, Michael.</i>

190
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
<i>God, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get those
right out of your way.</i>

191
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
- That's okay.
- I'm Vida.

192
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
- Carly Norris.
- Hi.

193
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

194
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,960
<i>Damn doormen.
I really tip them well, too.</i>

195
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,600
Everybody does.

196
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,760
That's why they're never around
when you need them.

197
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,640
You're right.
You should see them at Christmas.

198
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Like flies on shit then.

199
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,240
<i>Oh, yeah, this guy was here.</i>

200
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,360
He left this for you.

201
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,720
<i>- You're all moved in, then?
- Oh, God, no. I hate it.</i>

202
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I know. It's worse than anal intercourse.

203
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,160
<i>- You know, you look like...
- Yeah, the girl that...</i>

204
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
- Naomi.
- Yeah.

205
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,160
Somebody's already told you.
I guess they would have.

206
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,720
<i>- Were you friends?
- Well, sort of.</i>

207
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,240
<i>I mean, she was only here about a year.</i>

208
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>And most of that time, I was in Milan.</i>

209
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,560
Ass-pinching Italians.
My bum is still blue.

210
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>I couldn't believe it, though.</i>

211
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,920
<i>I mean,
she just didn't seem like the type.</i>

212
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
- Were you here when she...
- Yeah.

213
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,040
She came over
to borrow some coffee the night before.

214
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,920
- I didn't have any.
- Caffeine withdrawal.

215
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
That would do it to me.

216
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,400
That's my agent. He's a slimy bastard.

217
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,640
<i>Just a goddamned second,
all right, Michael?</i>

218
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,040
Hey. Thanks.

219
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
Right. So see you around.

220
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
<i>If you ever need
any coffee or anything...</i>

221
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,320
Just make sure you don't run out.

222
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,800
Mr. Brown. That's original.
And where's he staying?

223
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,120
<i>The Regency Arms?</i>

224
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,800
<i>Okay.</i>

225
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
<i>And what's his room number?</i>

226
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
<i>627, got it.</i>

227
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,560
<i>Yeah, well, they all say
they're producers or sheiks.</i>

228
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,320
<i>Hi, putz. I'm giving you
your last chance for Pavarotti.</i>

229
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,040
<i>Hey, isn't Pearl Jam
some sort of oriental sex thing?</i>

230
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,360
<i>Yummy.</i>

231
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,400
<i>Carla, this is Zeke Hawkins calling.</i>

232
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,560
<i>I hope you remember me.</i>

233
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,880
<i>I live in the building, too.</i>

234
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>We met in the lobby when you were
moving in last weekend?</i>

235
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,640
<i>Anyway, listen, I was just calling
to let you know that if you...</i>

236
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,280
<i>you know, need any help
with anything...</i>

237
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,680
<i>I've got some pull
with the manager, so...</i>

238
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,280
<i>don't be afraid to give me a call.</i>

239
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,240
<i>I'm at home most of the day.
My number's 555-3126.</i>

240
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>All righty? Okay, bye.</i>

241
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>Hi, it's Peter. We are moving up
the pub date on the Dean book.</i>

242
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,840
<i>Just thought I'd call
and let you know. Bye.</i>

243
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,400
<i>Yeah, but what about
the appointment with Sony in Osaka?</i>

244
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>11:30 on Monday?</i>

245
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
<i>Oh, well, I'll do it anytime they will.</i>

246
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,880
<i>I mean, I have to see them.
They're state-of-the-art.</i>

247
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,280
<i>... defensive system
is extraordinarily developed.</i>

248
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,320
<i>Acute schizophrenic, non-paranoid.</i>

249
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
<i>Classic Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome.</i>

250
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,480
<i>Clearly a great danger to women.</i>

251
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,400
<i>No, no, no.
It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

252
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>... we could rent one.</i>

253
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,920
<i>Well, that's an idea.</i>

254
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,840
<i>Hi, Zeke. It's Carla Norris.</i>

255
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,680
<i>Thanks for your call. I...</i>

256
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>If I ever get unpacked around here...</i>

257
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,040
<i>I was thinking of having
a cocktail party on Friday night.</i>

258
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,680
<i>Sometime after 6:00.</i>

259
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
<i>And I was wondering
if you'd like to come.</i>

260
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,000
<i>Okay, I hope that you do. Bye-bye.</i>

261
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,600
Brother!

262
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,240
<i>- Oh, you think that was funny?
- Yeah.</i>

263
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,080
I didn't think that was funny.
You scared the shit out of me.

264
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,440
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.</i>

265
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,760
<i>I'm sorry.
You're right, it wasn't funny. I...</i>

266
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,240
<i>It was a real dumb-ass thing to do.
Really, I'm sorry.</i>

267
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,520
Can we start over again? Huh?

268
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,040
What for? I really don't see the point.

269
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,040
<i>- Hey, did you get the books?
- Yeah.</i>

270
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,960
- Did you read them?
- No.

271
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,800
<i>Yeah, you did. You can't fool me.</i>

272
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,360
I read a few pages of one of them.

273
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
You read both of them.
You couldn't put them down.

274
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
<i>I'm right, aren't I? Tell me I'm right.</i>

275
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,680
You're wrong.

276
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,360
What?

277
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,120
<i>You don't like sex and violence?
It sells, you know.</i>

278
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
<i>It buys ranches in Montana, I'm told.</i>

279
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,680
You've been checking on me. I like that.

280
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,560
- Thank you.
- For what?

281
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,160
For stopping.

282
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,040
<i>Now, how about gossip?
About James Dean, for instance.</i>

283
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,240
Doesn't that sell?

284
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,440
You've been checking on me.
I don't like that.

285
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
I hear you're very good at the tell-alls.

286
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,200
I guess that comes
from being married to a very boring guy.

287
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,080
You just like all the juicy talk.

288
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,520
- Fuck you.
- Would you like to?

289
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
<i>I can try and make myself available.
Hey, look...</i>

290
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,240
<i>come on, I'm a writer.
People tell me their secrets...</i>

291
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,160
and I just take notes.
Like Truman Capote.

292
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,400
- You could tell me your secrets.
- I don't have any secrets.

293
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,480
Sure you do.

294
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,600
What secrets do I have?

295
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,320
I'd never tell.

296
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,760
Did you send me the telescope?

297
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,920
- Telescope?
- Yeah.

298
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,920
Why would I send you a telescope?

299
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,080
Hey.

300
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
I can't keep up with you.

301
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,800
<i>No, you can't.</i>

302
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
Taxi!

303
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,360
<i>Excuse me, Officers, let her through,
please. She lives here. Come on.</i>

304
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,600
<i>Come on, Miss Norris. Come on.</i>

305
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,760
- Do you live here?
- Did you know Mr. Hale?

306
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,120
How long have you lived
in this apartment?

307
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,280
How do you feel
about all these accidents?

308
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,240
<i>Yes, he was a lecturer at NYU.</i>

309
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,840
He doesn't seem to have had
any family. That's about all I know.

310
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,960
Miss? Miss?

311
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,440
- Are you a resident here?
- Yeah. Carla Norris...

312
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,440
- 20-B.
- 20-B?

313
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,800
- What happened?
- The guy in 23-B...

314
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>the professor, Gus Hale...</i>

315
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,160
apparently he fell in the shower
and broke his neck.

316
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
Did you know Mr. Hale?

317
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,120
- I talked to him.
- What about?

318
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,400
<i>Well, not that much, really.
We talked about...</i>

319
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,880
that he was going to Japan.

320
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,680
- We talked about Naomi Singer.
- What did he say about Naomi Singer?

321
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>That they were friends, and...</i>

322
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
that I look like her.

323
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
You do.

324
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,600
I don't remember
giving you an invitation.

325
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,240
I have a nose
for smelling parties in progress.

326
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,280
<i>Also, a bottle of Dom Perignon.</i>

327
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,600
<i>Come on in, honey. I like you already.</i>

328
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,000
- You hold and I'll pop.
- Yeah.

329
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,640
<i>Jack Landsford,
I'd like to introduce you...</i>

330
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,120
<i>to Judy, of course.</i>

331
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,600
Hi. Remember me?
We met in the doorway?

332
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,360
- And Peter.
- Hi. How are you?

333
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,040
<i>- Pete. Hey, Alex.
- Jack, how are you?</i>

334
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,720
- Good. How you been?
- And you know Vida.

335
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>- Hi, I'm Vida Warren.
- Hello. Jack Landsford.</i>

336
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm sorry.
I thought you two knew each other.

337
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,640
Say "cheese."

338
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,200
Jesus!

339
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
<i>- Oh, hey.
- Hello. Here you go.</i>

340
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,320
<i>- Is this Dom Perignon, too?
- California red.</i>

341
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh. I'm sorry.

342
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,040
<i>Now, this is very interesting.</i>

343
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,680
<i>It looks like Lalique, but it's not.
It's a copy.</i>

344
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,480
<i>You're right about that, Alex.</i>

345
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,680
Nothing in the haunted house
is what it appears to be.

346
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,640
They've remodeled it completely.

347
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Who owns it?

348
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,880
I heard it was some law firm downtown.

349
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,800
No. That's a false front.
I checked on that once.

350
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I bet I could find out who owns it.

351
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,320
I know some people.

352
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,520
I could make a few calls
if you really want to know.

353
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,680
<i>Pete, don't.</i>

354
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,840
It could be the Mob.
We could be supporting crack dealers.

355
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,280
Then what are we gonna do? Move out?

356
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
There's an idea.

357
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Thank you.

358
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
- It's a great party.
- Thank you.

359
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,720
Hey there. Can I get you something?

360
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>I'm fine, thanks.</i>

361
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,840
<i>- So, how do you like the new place?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

362
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,320
Did you know Naomi Singer?

363
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,480
Not really. I saw her around a few times.

364
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
I wonder why she did it.

365
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,560
<i>Yeah. I don't know, I think I read
something about boyfriend troubles.</i>

366
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,720
<i>Oh, they're doing it!</i>

367
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,920
<i>Oh, they are! I can't believe it!</i>

368
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,040
Something exciting happening.

369
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I don't believe it. They are!

370
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Let me see. Let me see.

371
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
<i>Oh, they sure are.</i>

372
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,080
Would you look at her?
She's a voyeur. She can't get enough.

373
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,880
<i>- I am not.
- Yes, you are.</i>

374
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,920
That's why you have this telescope
out here.

375
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,160
- It's not even mine!
- You're a peeper! A peeper!

376
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,280
Somebody gave this to me.

377
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,400
- Right.
- Everybody has a telescope.

378
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,160
- I don't.
- I do.

379
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,960
<i>- Thank you.
- I do, too.</i>

380
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm shocked. I'm truly shocked.
You people are shameless.

381
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,600
You're all shameless.
What is with you guys?

382
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
<i>- Will you look at that?
- Come on, Alex.</i>

383
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,960
<i>- Hurry up, before they finish.
- Just a moment.</i>

384
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
<i>I wanna look, too.</i>

385
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

386
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,040
It looks like they're being Rolfed.

387
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,560
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

388
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,600
- Goodnight. Thank you for coming.
- Thanks. Bye.

389
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

390
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,200
Goodnight. And thanks for the wine.

391
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,760
- Sorry about the California red.
- I like California red.

392
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,920
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

393
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
<i>Listen, do you work out?</i>

394
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,680
<i>You mean,
like exercise bikes and stuff?</i>

395
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,560
<i>No, no. The real thing. Weights.</i>

396
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,040
<i>- You want to check it out?
- Oh. No, thank you.</i>

397
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,640
You would have a great time.

398
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
<i>What do you think?
Tomorrow morning, maybe?</i>

399
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,960
<i>You know, there are mirrors
all over those places.</i>

400
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,120
There are no mirrors.

401
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,920
They're everywhere you look.

402
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,080
No mirrors. Promise.

403
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,600
What do you say? 10:00? I'll call you?

404
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
I'll call you. Bye.

405
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,280
That was a great party.

406
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,200
I thank you.

407
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,200
You're welcome.

408
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,920
<i>Who knows, maybe next time
I'll even get an invitation, huh?</i>

409
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,240
<i>- Maybe.
- Oh, you got to be careful.</i>

410
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,120
Maybe means "yes"
to an old ex-journalist like myself.

411
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,960
The operative word being "ex."

412
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
Yeah.

413
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,200
But us investigative reporters
never lose the instinct...

414
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,000
to jump in at the slightest opening.

415
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,400
<i>That would explain you jumping out
at me in the park, then, I guess.</i>

416
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
No.

417
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
That was a tactic I developed
in junior high school to get the babes.

418
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,160
<i>It didn't work then, either.</i>

419
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,480
<i>You don't go out much, do you?</i>

420
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,080
I thought...

421
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,680
maybe in lieu of the gym...

422
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,920
you might want to go to dinner with me.

423
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,040
Maybe.

424
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,240
I'll take that maybe as a yes.

425
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,040
<i>- Goodnight, Carla.
- Goodnight, Jack.</i>

426
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,760
<i>... should climb to about 69 degrees.</i>

427
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,720
<i>Humidity levels slipping to about 15%.</i>

428
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,120
<i>Clouds and rain to return
with possible showers on Monday.</i>

429
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,440
<i>Temperatures for that period
should span the 60s and 70s.</i>

430
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,840
<i>Now, here's the New York One
traveler's advisory...</i>

431
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,760
<i>with a look at conditions
and temperatures...</i>

432
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
<i>for selected cities across the nation.</i>

433
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,600
<i>Remember, weather on the One every
10 minutes, here on New York One.</i>

434
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,200
Hello?

435
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
Is somebody out there?

436
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,920
What's the matter? Jesus!

437
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,000
<i>- You okay, Miss Norris?
- Yes.</i>

438
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,920
I hear something in my office.

439
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,320
<i>- What the hell happened?
- I was...</i>

440
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,920
<i>The lights went out, and...</i>

441
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,240
<i>the door was jammed,
and then I heard this sound. I just...</i>

442
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,760
<i>Look, it must have jammed.</i>

443
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Come on. I think all this
haunted house crap is getting to you.

444
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,360
I don't believe it. You're such a liar.

445
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,160
<i>Well, well, well. Looks like they must
have put up a few mirrors in here, huh?</i>

446
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,600
<i>Yeah, overnight, right?</i>

447
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,080
Come on. Come on.
The locker room's right over here.

448
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
You conned me into this.

449
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,960
It'll be fun. Trust me.

450
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,720
Okay. Your turn.

451
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,280
<i>- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.</i>

452
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,080
Come on. I'll teach you.

453
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,360
Okay.

454
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,920
Great. Great.

455
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,240
Just want to keep your hips straight.

456
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,520
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a very nice butt?

457
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,720
- I already know you're a liar.
- You do.

458
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,160
Nobody's told me that in a long time.

459
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,560
<i>Well, that's because the wrong people
have been looking at it.</i>

460
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,600
That's true.

461
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,720
<i>- How often do you work out?
- Three, four times a week.</i>

462
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,040
I'm starving. How about you?

463
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,680
Yeah.

464
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,040
How do you find the time?

465
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,760
I work at home.
I design computer video games.

466
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,080
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

467
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,080
<i>You think I'm too young for you,
don't you?</i>

468
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,400
<i>What?</i>

469
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,800
<i>- You do, don't you?
- No.</i>

470
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,600
<i>- I wasn't thinking about that.
- Liar.</i>

471
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

472
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,760
<i>I'm not.</i>

473
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,640
You like it?

474
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,760
Yeah. I love it. I play it all the time.

475
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,200
- So you really do have the beer.
- I told you it wasn't a ruse.

476
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,840
Thank you.

477
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,160
- What's that?
- A volcano.

478
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,600
I've always loved them.

479
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,320
I'd like to fly into one sometime.

480
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,280
Why?

481
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,600
I don't know. It sounds like fun.

482
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,280
Don't you think?

483
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,480
I have to go.

484
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,040
<i>- Please, I...
- It's okay.</i>

485
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,680
<i>You're so beautiful, Carly.</i>

486
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,840
They'll see.

487
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,520
I want to see.

488
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
I want to see you.

489
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,040
It's okay.

490
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,840
It's okay. I'm here.

491
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,880
What are you worried about?

492
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,640
Somebody's watching you
like you watch them?

493
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Why don't you come over here
with me and lie down?

494
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,280
Why? So you can talk dirty to me
some more?

495
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,920
Please?

496
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,640
<i>Oh, I have to go.</i>

497
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,160
<i>It's my building, Carly. I own it.</i>

498
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,160
I even helped redesign it.

499
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,720
<i>My father owned
a bunch of hotels, so I...</i>

500
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,040
I inherited a lot of money.

501
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,320
And I didn't want to be bothered
with a lot of hassles...

502
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,000
so I just don't tell people that I own it.

503
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,440
Did you tell Mrs. McEvoy
to give me special treatment?

504
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,960
No.

505
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,800
But I did approve
your application quickly.

506
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,800
<i>You had me all plotted out, huh?</i>

507
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,080
I just thought we would like each other.

508
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,840
<i>You're not angry with me, are you?</i>

509
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,680
<i>Boy, have I got something to tell you.
You're not going to believe it!</i>

510
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,320
<i>This is Judy. Will you call me?</i>

511
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,880
<i>Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.</i>

512
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,920
<i>Something's going on, I can smell it.</i>

513
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,720
<i>You've probably been having
multiple orgasms.</i>

514
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,720
<i>You've probably been
fucking your brains out.</i>

515
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,560
<i>I have.</i>

516
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,480
<i>Carly, Alex is all over me
about the Dean book.</i>

517
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,120
<i>Please, please work on it
this weekend. Bye.</i>

518
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,600
Goodnight.

519
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,520
<i>Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.</i>

520
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,960
You do look like you fucked
your brains out. Look at you.

521
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,280
What are you smiling at?
That damn éclair?

522
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,120
- I'm just smiling. That's all.
- Tell me.

523
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,160
I want to know everything.
Every little grunt. Every little wiggle.

524
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,720
There's nothing to tell.

525
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,720
You've been spending too much time
with your vibrator.

526
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,160
I certainly have.
I'm getting a plastic yeast infection.

527
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,400
Who is he? Do I know him? Tell me.

528
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
- Tell me.
- You met him.

529
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,280
I met him? And I didn't pin him
to the wall and ravish him myself?

530
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,920
And you got him?
Now I'm pissed. Who?

531
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,680
It's Zeke. You met him at my apartment.

532
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,880
<i>That gorgeous, young, incredible...
Oh, my God, I hate you.</i>

533
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,440
I really hate you. How is he?

534
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,320
Give me the goods. Is he insatiable?
I bet he's insatiable.

535
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,960
<i>They all are at that age.
Lead pencils, that's what they are.</i>

536
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,800
<i>I hate you. I really, really hate you.</i>

537
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,120
<i>I mean, I go away
with the other one, right...</i>

538
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,600
<i>for what I think is going to be
a hot, steamy weekend...</i>

539
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,040
and you're reloading a lead pencil.

540
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,360
I must have done something terrible
in my past life.

541
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,760
- Wait. You went off with who?
- Jack Landsford.

542
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,520
<i>Who's not even a sharpened pencil,
let me tell you.</i>

543
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,520
We went to Montauk. Stayed in a cabin.

544
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,280
- What happened?
- Nothing. Not a damn thing.

545
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,240
The earth definitely did not move.

546
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,200
<i>All he did was ask about you.
You know, you should go out with him.</i>

547
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,360
Just to find out for me
if he's even got a pencil.

548
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,640
I'll bet it's something blue.

549
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,040
Something intimate.

550
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,920
Something lacy.

551
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,120
Something whorish.

552
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,640
How did you get in here?

553
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,400
The door was open.

554
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,120
I've lived in New York for 10 years
and I've never left my door open.

555
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,480
<i>Well, maybe you did this time.</i>

556
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,440
- Maybe the super did.
- I don't think so. I want you to leave.

557
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,520
He was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

558
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,520
<i>Maybe she smelt like flowers, too.</i>

559
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,560
Maybe you two
use the same spermicide.

560
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,800
- I'm calling...
- She was seeing a shrink.

561
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,160
She told the shrink about your boyfriend.

562
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,120
<i>And after Naomi was murdered,
the shrink told the police.</i>

563
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,640
He's not my boyfriend.

564
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,720
<i>Oh? Well, what the hell is he, then?</i>

565
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,560
The neighborhood florist?
I saw you two in the lobby together.

566
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,080
I'm not blind.

567
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,520
<i>My God, you really do look like her.</i>

568
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,280
She died right here.

569
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,160
She went off that balcony.

570
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,640
<i>You don't really know
what you're dealing with, do you?</i>

571
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,680
He's fucked up.

572
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,440
<i>He's so very, very sick.</i>

573
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,960
<i>You don't believe me, do you?</i>

574
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,880
All right. Here.

575
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,280
You call Lieutenant Hendrix.
16th Precinct. Go on.

576
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,520
Go on. Ask her.

577
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,480
Your boyfriend owns the building.

578
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,560
<i>I bet you didn't know that, did you?</i>

579
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,800
<i>I'll bet he didn't tell you, did he?</i>

580
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,720
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

581
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,040
You know how difficult it was
for the police to discover that?

582
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,240
<i>This guy has more false fronts,
more high-powered attorneys...</i>

583
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,920
than Richard fucking Nixon!

584
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,160
You know what I think?

585
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,160
I think you can't write anymore.

586
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,960
And I think you're making this up
to hide the fact that you can't.

587
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,360
<i>I'm sorry for you, Jack.</i>

588
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,760
I really am.

589
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,160
But if I ever find you
in my apartment again...

590
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm gonna have you
thrown out of the building.

591
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,360
Goodbye.

592
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,680
Are you hungry?

593
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,200
- I've already eaten.
- Liar.

594
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,760
You're afraid of me.

595
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,080
Do I look like a girl
who would be frightened of you?

596
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,760
<i>I did sort of come on strong yesterday.</i>

597
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,880
<i>Well, I came on strong, too.</i>

598
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,800
Do you want to go out for some truffles?

599
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,520
<i>Truffles?</i>

600
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,040
<i>- Now?
- Yeah, why not? I love truffles.</i>

601
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,600
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Wear what I sent you.

602
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,680
<i>Meet me downstairs in one hour.</i>

603
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,480
Hurry. One hour.

604
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,600
- Taxi!
- Did you think I wasn't coming?

605
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,320
No.

606
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,680
I knew you wanted me to think
that you weren't coming.

607
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,640
You look good enough to eat.

608
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,560
<i>- Are you ready to order yet, sir?
- Not yet, thank you.</i>

609
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,320
<i>Very well, sir.</i>

610
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,840
<i>- Your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.</i>

611
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,000
- What?
- Nothing.

612
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,320
<i>You like playing games, don't you?</i>

613
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,240
I like playing games
with people who like playing games.

614
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,400
What game do I like to play?

615
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,680
Scrabble?

616
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,360
I hate Scrabble
because I'm awful at Scrabble.

617
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,360
<i>- I like poker, though.
- So do I.</i>

618
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,840
- Would you like to play?
- Now?

619
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,600
Right now.

620
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,440
The police came to see me today.

621
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,440
Found out I owned the building
and were asking all sorts of questions...

622
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,640
about the wiring.

623
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,240
<i>I had such a terrible day,
I couldn't get any work done.</i>

624
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,800
Are we playing poker now?

625
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,200
We're about to start.

626
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,560
Did you like the bra and panties?

627
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,160
Yes.

628
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,120
Are you wearing them?

629
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,320
Maybe.

630
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,640
I think you are.

631
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,880
Show me.

632
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,800
- Right here?
- Right here.

633
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,400
I'm sorry. I can't see that.
I'm nearsighted.

634
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,120
Can you see this?

635
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,200
Yes.

636
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,600
What about the panties?

637
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,720
Panties?

638
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,000
Yes. The panties.

639
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,440
Are you wearing the panties?

640
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,000
Forget it.

641
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,320
<i>I win, you lose, this game.</i>

642
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,200
I can't tell.

643
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,000
<i>I win, you lose.</i>

644
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,440
This game.

645
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,040
<i>Are you ready to order yet, sir?</i>

646
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,760
Where are we going?

647
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,400
- Thirteen.
- It's an unlucky number.

648
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,560
It's an unlucky apartment building.

649
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,960
Good night.

650
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,840
Put these on.

651
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,040
I wouldn't want you to catch a draft.

652
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,080
I'm okay. I'm pretty warm down there.

653
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,520
See you soon.

654
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,640
Zeke?

655
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,160
Zeke?

656
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,760
Hello?

657
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,600
Damn you. You left the door open.

658
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,200
You knew I'd come.

659
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,760
I thought we came together.

660
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,840
Did you and Naomi come together?

661
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,520
I hardly knew her. I told you.

662
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,640
She told someone
you had an affair with her.

663
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,680
That's crazy. She came on to me once.

664
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,320
Maybe she fantasized.

665
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,680
I heard she had an affair
with your friend.

666
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,480
<i>- What friend?
- Your writer friend, Jack.</i>

667
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,160
- Who told you that?
- Your neighbor Vida.

668
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,800
She told me at your party. No big deal.

669
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,160
<i>If you stay,
you could wake up in my arms.</i>

670
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,480
We could kiss to start the day.

671
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,360
I could make you breakfast.

672
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,880
We could go for a walk in the park
and hold hands.

673
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,760
Am I scaring you again?

674
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,160
I don't wanna get hurt.

675
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,560
<i>Hi. This is Vida. Leave a message.</i>

676
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,760
<i>Vida? Vida, are you there?
It's Carly Norris.</i>

677
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,320
<i>Vida, I need to talk to you
about something.</i>

678
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,720
Can you give me a call?

679
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,240
It's really important.

680
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,160
<i>- Hello?
- Jack, it's Carly Norris.</i>

681
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,080
Hi.

682
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,920
<i>Look, clearly this is
none of my business, but...</i>

683
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,000
Vida told me that it was you...

684
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,320
that was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

685
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,360
That's bullshit.

686
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,240
<i>Vida tell you that?</i>

687
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,280
<i>No, I think your boyfriend
told you that, didn't he?</i>

688
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,200
<i>Vida didn't tell you that, did she?</i>

689
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,200
<i>Hey, Vida.</i>

690
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,440
<i>Hi, I got your message.
I'll call you tonight.</i>

691
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,240
I've got a job and I'm really late.

692
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,560
I just...

693
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,040
I just wanted to...

694
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,040
<i>Look, I don't wanna get caught in there.</i>

695
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,000
<i>- Vida, I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah, I'll call you later, okay?</i>

696
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
<i>Well, okay.</i>

697
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,560
Shit.

698
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,840
Fucking building.

699
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,000
You just lie there. Be still.

700
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,560
Are you happy now? Are you happy?

701
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,800
Carly?

702
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,880
<i>Oh, Jesus!</i>

703
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,000
<i>Carly, don't run!</i>

704
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,440
Did Miss Warren know Jack Landsford?

705
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,880
I think so.

706
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,640
Because I saw Jack and Vida
on the street.

707
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,080
- When was that?
- About a week ago.

708
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,520
Jack was giving her some money.

709
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,480
<i>This isn't your knife, is it, Jack?</i>

710
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,160
I don't think so.

711
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,640
<i>Hey, Jack, you know Vida Warren?</i>

712
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,080
<i>No. I mean, yeah.</i>

713
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,320
I met her once at Carly Norris' party.

714
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,440
<i>You're somewhat of a player,
aren't you, Jack?</i>

715
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,360
<i>With the ladies, I mean.</i>

716
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,200
<i>I date, sure.
So do you, McCracken, you hump.</i>

717
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,080
- Were you dating Vida Warren?
- No.

718
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,640
<i>Oh, Jack. We got a problem.</i>

719
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,480
We found these pictures of you
all over her apartment.

720
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,040
Those are my publicity photos.
I keep them in my desk.

721
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,160
He set me up.

722
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,840
<i>- God damn it, he set me up!
- Who set you up, Jack?</i>

723
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,560
<i>Zeke Hawkins, the guy in 13-A.
You talked to him yet?</i>

724
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,240
<i>Well, why would he want
to do that, Jack?</i>

725
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,480
A woman.

726
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,320
A woman. What woman?

727
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,000
Naomi Singer. Remember her?

728
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,080
- The suicide?
- Yeah.

729
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,520
<i>You got any idea why this Singer
woman would wanna kill herself, Jack?</i>

730
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,000
<i>No. Hey, you guys know me.
I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.</i>

731
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,480
<i>Were you seeing her, Jack?</i>

732
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,880
Yeah.

733
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,480
<i>I mean, we got women dying all over
the place around you, don't we, Jack?</i>

734
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,520
<i>- Hey, fuck you, McCracken.
- Hey, fuck you, Jack!</i>

735
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,080
<i>Back off, McCracken, will you?</i>

736
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,680
<i>- Mac.
- Take it easy, Jack.</i>

737
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,120
- Jesus Christ.
- You tell him to take it easy.

738
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,840
What's the matter with you guys?
You know me. I didn't do this.

739
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,600
- I want my attorney.
- All right.

740
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,720
You spent part of the year
up in Montana.

741
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,000
<i>You got some kind of a ranch
up there, Jack?</i>

742
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,160
<i>Yeah, so what?</i>

743
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,160
- What's the name of that place?
- The name?

744
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,080
<i>- Yeah, the name.
- The Flying L.</i>

745
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,760
<i>The Flying L, huh?</i>

746
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,200
<i>You parking your horse
in Vida Warren's closet, pardner?</i>

747
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,120
- I want my attorney down here now.
- All right.

748
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,760
- I want him now!
- You'll get him.

749
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,400
The D.A.'s gonna charge him.

750
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,200
He will make bail.

751
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,000
<i>He's coming back here, isn't he?</i>

752
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,760
We'll know it if he does.

753
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,640
How will we know?
He could be there right now.

754
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,360
Let's see if he is.

755
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,680
Come on.

756
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,200
You know my mother was an actress
on the soaps?

757
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,840
She used to spend
most of the year in LA.

758
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,200
I used to take a cab home from school
and watch her on TV.

759
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,000
That was just about my life with her.

760
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,040
I had it custom-built in Osaka.

761
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,640
It cost me $6 million.

762
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,480
He's not there.

763
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,520
<i>We'll know if he is, though.</i>

764
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,160
<i>Tomorrow night.
Yeah, I have to be in at 5:00.</i>

765
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,320
<i>No, it's just me. Can you believe it?
There must have been 600 girls there.</i>

766
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,560
Put my apartment on.

767
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,000
<i>- There's nobody home there, either.
- Put it on.</i>

768
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,680
<i>Aren't you gonna come meet us?</i>

769
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,880
<i>Yeah, we're gonna be there in
about a half hour, if I can get ready.</i>

770
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,080
<i>No, I think Henry will be there.</i>

771
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,240
<i>No, he just called me, like,
20 minutes ago.</i>

772
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,720
<i>What does that have
to do with anything?</i>

773
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,240
<i>My God, have you slept with her?</i>

774
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,200
<i>Did you sleep with her?
Simple question, Will.</i>

775
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,120
<i>You're making me do something
I don't want to do.</i>

776
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,280
<i>I know.</i>

777
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,120
You watch them?

778
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,720
<i>- You watch these people?
- So do you, Carly, with your telescope.</i>

779
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,480
<i>- Oh, you...
- I just have better technology.</i>

780
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,840
<i>You want gossip?
I'll give you real gossip. Real life, Carly.</i>

781
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,120
It's better than any book.
Better than any movie.

782
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,960
It's a soap opera. It's real life.

783
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,880
<i>It's a tragedy, it's funny,
it's sad, it's unpredictable.</i>

784
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,040
<i>- Look for yourself, Carly.
- It's wrong.</i>

785
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,120
It's the same as your James Dean book.

786
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,400
Only nobody gets hurt.

787
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,720
<i>- You ready?
- Yes...</i>

788
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,560
They don't even know.

789
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,200
<i>Open the door, Zeke.</i>

790
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,760
<i>Look, Carly, don't...</i>

791
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,440
I love you.

792
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,760
<i>Give me a little bit more time,
for God's sake!</i>

793
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,440
<i>You will ride with your dad, okay?
That's it. No more.</i>

794
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,200
<i>He's not my father, and I'm not riding
with him alone. I don't...</i>

795
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,400
<i>Jonie, get back in here!
Jonie! Come here.</i>

796
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,760
<i>You be nicer to him!</i>

797
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,080
<i>- He touches me.
- Stop it!</i>

798
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,600
<i>He puts his hands on me, Mom,
every chance he gets.</i>

799
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
<i>Don't start. I don't wanna hear it.</i>

800
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,080
<i>He is a decent, hard-working man.</i>

801
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,240
<i>I hate him! I hate him!</i>

802
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,280
<i>- Don't you...
- I hate you, Mom! I hate you!</i>

803
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,440
The little girl's right.
Every chance he gets.

804
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,600
<i>I hate him, Pony, I really do. I hate him.</i>

805
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,120
<i>Whenever the mother's not around,
he's got his hands all over her.</i>

806
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,160
Why don't you give it a try?
You just have to tap the touch screen.

807
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,240
<i>There are some alternatives.
I realize you're in a lot of pain.</i>

808
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,520
- Would you like something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

809
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,960
You haven't eaten anything all day.

810
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,480
You're like a kid with a new toy.

811
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,960
<i>But it's not a toy, is it?</i>

812
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,960
No.

813
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,360
Are you the one
that sent me the telescope?

814
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,600
Yes.

815
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,600
Why did you do it?

816
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,000
<i>Not now, honey.</i>

817
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
<i>What did the x-ray show?</i>

818
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,160
<i>Some kind of shadow, that's all.</i>

819
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,200
<i>Don't worry about it.
It could be anything.</i>

820
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,360
<i>Baby, please tell me everything.
What did he say?</i>

821
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,800
<i>- He said it might be a tumor.
- A tumor?</i>

822
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,840
Were you watching Vida
when she got killed?

823
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,920
No. The lights had gone down
in the stairwell.

824
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,320
What about the others?

825
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,880
I wasn't watching.

826
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,400
<i>I did see Gus Hale
on the floor of the shower, though.</i>

827
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,160
I was the one who called the police.

828
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,960
Do you tape these?

829
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,640
Yes.

830
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,400
Did you tape us?

831
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,840
Would you like to see?

832
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,880
Yes.

833
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,040
There's so much on this tape.

834
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,600
<i>Come on, where is it?</i>

835
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,600
<i>You see, sometimes I just let it run
on record in one apartment for a while.</i>

836
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,480
Like my own little soap opera.

837
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,200
I don't even have the time
to watch most of what I record.

838
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,840
It's amazing what I've found
on some of these tapes.

839
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,000
Good morning.

840
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,400
<i>Oh, God. Are you all right?</i>

841
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,840
- Carly.
- I'm fine.

842
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,160
We've been so worried about you.
Everybody's been calling.

843
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,720
<i>Yeah, and to think I spent the weekend
with an impotent maniac...</i>

844
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:15,000
<i>hoping that he'd, you know...
The police even talked to me.</i>

845
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,200
Carly Norris.

846
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,560
<i>- Carly, will you come and see me later...
- It's Zeke Hawkins.</i>

847
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,840
...and tell me the real skinny?

848
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,440
<i>I wanna hear everything, darling.</i>

849
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, guess what?</i>

850
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,760
<i>I called Ballinger at his office, you know
the guy who can't keep his hands...</i>

851
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,920
<i>off his stepdaughter?</i>

852
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,000
<i>I told him if he ever touched her again,
I'd kill him.</i>

853
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,920
<i>- What did he do?
- He panicked, that's what he did.</i>

854
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,120
I just wish you could have heard him.

855
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,400
<i>Hey, maybe we should
start wiring the whole town, huh?</i>

856
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,640
That way we could see everything.

857
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,240
<i>You there, Carly?</i>

858
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,960
I don't know what to do.

859
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,120
<i>Just come home, you.</i>

860
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,600
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

861
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:52,040
Don't you scream.
Don't. I'm not gonna hurt you.

862
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,080
<i>He set me up, Carly. Zeke set me up.</i>

863
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
<i>I believe you. I do, I believe you.</i>

864
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,880
It's okay. Let me go. Let me go.

865
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,640
He's sick. That man is sick.

866
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,080
His mother died when he was 17.
She was a soap opera actress.

867
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,160
Do you know how she died? She fell.

868
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,240
- She fell?
- She fell in the shower.

869
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,840
- Look!
- What?

870
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:23,120
<i>Look, Carly. Thea Manning.
That's his mother, Carly.</i>

871
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,200
<i>- Who does she look like?
- Oh, she...</i>

872
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,040
<i>She looks like you, Carly.</i>

873
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,040
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

874
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,440
<i>Hey, are you coming down?</i>

875
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,240
<i>- Why don't you come over here?
- Why? What's up?</i>

876
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,800
<i>Well, because I have a surprise for you.</i>

877
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,920
Great. I'll be right there.

878
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,760
Okay.

879
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,560
- Sit down.
- Okay.

880
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,240
<i>- Hey, you.
- Hi.</i>

881
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,240
<i>A little dark in here, don't you think?</i>

882
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,400
<i>- He's got a gun!
- Sit down! All right, you bastard!</i>

883
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,600
<i>You tell the truth now,
or I'll blow your brains out.</i>

884
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,800
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You killed Naomi Singer.

885
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,080
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

886
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,680
<i>- How'd your mother die, Zeke?
- My mother?</i>

887
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,160
<i>Yeah, she fell in the shower,
wasn't that it?</i>

888
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,760
She had an aneurysm and fell.

889
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,280
She fell in the shower
the way you killed Gus Hale.

890
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,400
<i>- Gus Hale?
- Yeah, and he killed Vida, too.</i>

891
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,520
Didn't you? Didn't you?

892
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,360
<i>Three now, Jack? I killed three people?</i>

893
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,920
<i>First of all, I didn't
even know Naomi Singer.</i>

894
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,000
<i>But you did, Jack.
'Cause I saw you with her.</i>

895
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,760
So I know
why you would want to kill her.

896
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,640
<i>What do you mean, you saw us?</i>

897
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,840
<i>I also saw her give you a key
to this apartment, right, Jack?</i>

898
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,480
<i>Is that how he got in here
this time, huh?</i>

899
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,080
<i>- Is it?
- You still have the key, don't you?</i>

900
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,360
<i>- Why don't you show it to us, Jack?
- What the hell are you talking about?</i>

901
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,400
<i>I'm talking about the fact that you
just couldn't get it up, could you, Jack?</i>

902
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,240
<i>I saw that, too.
Is that why you killed her, Jack?</i>

903
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,520
<i>- Is it? Is it?
- He's lying, Carly. He's lying.</i>

904
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,280
<i>Jack, I don't know what to believe.</i>

905
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,880
Just show me the key.

906
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,480
<i>No, Jack! No.</i>

907
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:47,080
<i>Jack, let go! Jack. No!</i>

908
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,720
<i>Oh, my...</i>

909
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,320
<i>Because he was already in this room,
but I didn't see him.</i>

910
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,960
<i>And when he came out,
I saw that he had a gun.</i>

911
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,120
He started screaming at me.

912
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,800
<i>And...</i>

913
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,560
Sorry.

914
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:24,800
Then we wrestled around
on the ground.

915
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,240
And...

916
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,880
the gun skidded across the floor there...

917
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,840
and I picked it up.

918
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,400
How did he get in?

919
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,800
Your door wasn't forced.

920
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
He must have had a key.

921
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,280
<i>I mean, it was just like before.
He was already in here.</i>

922
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,240
He had these in his pocket.

923
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,760
Try them.

924
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,680
Jack Landsford's got a sheet with us.
He's a known offender.

925
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:15,160
Assaulted his ex-wife more than once.
She dropped charges.

926
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,720
I wish she hadn't.

927
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,480
Maybe we wouldn't
have two women dead.

928
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,160
He didn't get in with these.

929
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,040
- You guys about done here?
- Finished.

930
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,240
<i>- Where?
- Floor, next to the counter.</i>

931
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,480
This yours?

932
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,200
No.

933
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,040
Bingo.

934
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,560
<i>Well, that wraps it.</i>

935
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,640
The D.A.'s gonna need to see you both
tomorrow morning...

936
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,800
<i>down at the precinct. Say, 9:30?</i>

937
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,240
You know where it is.

938
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,440
Let's secure it.

939
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,960
<i>I don't...</i>

940
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,800
I don't want to stay here tonight.

941
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,600
Stay with me.

942
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,600
Stay with me.

943
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,400
Okay?

944
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,840
<i>Jonie, can we talk for a minute?</i>

945
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,680
<i>Have you told anyone that I...</i>

946
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,960
<i>- Just Mom.
- You're sure?</i>

947
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,120
<i>Jonie, I'm sorry.</i>

948
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,800
<i>It was just, I couldn't help myself.</i>

949
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,880
<i>It'll never happen again.
I swear it. Never.</i>

950
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,840
It's like playing God.

951
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,760
- We'll only do good things.
- I don't want to do this.

952
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:45,000
I want my privacy.
I want my own experiences.

953
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,000
<i>Zeke, I want to have a real relationship.</i>

954
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,600
<i>Carly, I love you.
You can have anything you want.</i>

955
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,880
I want my tape.

956
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,440
<i>If I have you, I don't need them, right?</i>

957
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,120
Hold on.

958
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,400
Erased.

959
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,640
- You okay?
- Yeah.

960
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,360
Tired.

961
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,960
<i>And hungry, I guess.</i>

962
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,440
I'll go get something for us.
What would you like?

963
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,800
Anything.

964
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,280
You're so beautiful.

965
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,920
Be right back.

966
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,680
<i>You're so beautiful, Vida.</i>

967
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,200
<i>You're so beautiful, Vida.</i>

968
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,320
<i>You smell so good.</i>

969
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,920
<i>You smell so good.</i>

970
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,360
<i>I love you, Naomi.</i>

971
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,520
<i>I love you. You smell like roses.</i>

972
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,760
Carly.

973
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,840
<i>Come on. Come on, open the door!
Let's go. Open up!</i>

974
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,120
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

975
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,680
<i>Carly...</i>

976
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,840
<i>you're watching me, aren't you?</i>

977
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,640
Are you looking at me?

978
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:24,000
<i>You're looking at me.
I can tell, I can feel it.</i>

979
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,320
<i>I love you, Carly.</i>

980
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,040
<i>Carly, let me in. Come on.</i>

981
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
<i>Peekaboo. You see me.</i>

982
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,680
<i>Come on, open the door. Now.</i>

983
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,680
<i>Now, Carly! Open the fucking door!</i>

984
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:50,560
<i>Come on,
open this cocksucking door, now!</i>

985
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,080
Open up! Come on!

986
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,280
<i>Open up the fucking door, Carly, now!</i>

987
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,080
You like to watch? Watch this.

988
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,600
<i>Carly! No, stop!</i>

989
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,880
Those women meant nothing to me.

990
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,480
<i>It was just sex, Carly.</i>

991
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,280
I love you.

992
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,720
That was the past.

993
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,560
<i>What we have is so powerful, Carly.
Can't you feel it?</i>

994
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,160
It feels so good.

995
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,160
<i>You can feel it, can't you?</i>

996
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,680
<i>Give me the gun, Carly.</i>

997
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,160
<i>I love you, Carly.</i>

998
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,960
Carly!

999
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,280
<i>Carly, please! Please don't!</i>

1000
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,400
<i>Carly, please don't!</i>

1001
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,800
Carly!

1002
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,520
Get a life.

1003
01:43:10,721 --> 01:47:25,521
