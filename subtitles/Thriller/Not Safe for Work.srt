1
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:20,540
I know. I know.

2
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,978
Hey, man. It's been a while.

3
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:36,146
Land anywhere yet?

4
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,145
- No.
- Yeah, it's tough out there.

5
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:41,259
Well, they say it's coming back.

6
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:43,741
Not for me, it's not.

7
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,467
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:30,621
Put the gun down!

9
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:32,624
Somebody had to do something.

10
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,348
Don't do it!

11
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,186
The FDA has approved Denning
Pharmaceutical's new wonder drug.

12
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:20,826
Another blockbuster quarter
for Denning Pharmaceutical..

13
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,826
The news that the company's
new drug Prophidil,

14
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,986
is on the fast track
to FDA approval.

15
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,946
A major class action suit
against Denning Pharmaceutical

16
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,826
is gaining momentum on allegations

17
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,906
that the company had evidence that
its flagship drug, Prophidil,

18
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:36,018
has potentially fatal side effects.

19
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,426
No, I'm on my way
to the office now.

20
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:44,027
You can't put yourself in danger.

21
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,906
In danger? No, no,
I'm not in danger.

22
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,066
The news said he
worked for Denning,

23
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,186
isn't that the case you're on?

24
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,746
He killed seven people.

25
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,786
Yeah, including himself.
So, I think I'm safe.

26
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:54,386
Though I think he may have ruined any
chance of my getting a promotion.

27
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,306
- How come?
- He screwed me.

28
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,986
- What do you mean?
- 'Cause he was our key witness.

29
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,186
You don't have other witnesses?

30
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,226
Yeah, but without him,
the whole case is a bust.

31
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:03,347
I know, I'm not an expert, but
you wanna hear what I think?

32
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,466
Of course, I do. Talk to me.

33
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,026
I think you need a security detail.

34
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,306
Someone should make
sure that you're okay.

35
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,946
You're good.

36
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:11,587
- Interesting, interesting.
- Will you get reassigned?

37
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:14,586
I hope so, I wrote a memo on the
Gambizzi case I'm turning in today.

38
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:15,827
That's great.

39
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:17,586
Yeah, I should be on
Gambizzi by lunch.

40
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:19,306
Mom, I gotta go, I gotta go.
I'm running late.

41
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,338
- Love you.
- I love you too.

42
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,586
Excuse me, sorry.
I just gotta.. Sorry.

43
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,586
I need to get through.
Thank you. Okay.

44
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,266
Thanks.

45
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,264
Tom. It's Monday.

46
00:05:58,547 --> 00:05:59,782
I knew that.

47
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,298
- Tom.
- Janine.

48
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,586
So what's going on in there?

49
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:07,186
The servers went down in
Kansas City last night.

50
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:09,266
- We lost all offsite backups.
- Oh.

51
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,746
You're gonna be making
copies all day long.

52
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,986
Yay, I love making copies.

53
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,426
- Really?
- Not really. Where's Emmerich?

54
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:15,586
Hmm, on the warpath.

55
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,664
- I gotta get this to Moyers.
- Got it.

56
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,026
Why don't you take
the scenic route?

57
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,187
- And don't let him see you.
- I love you, Janine.

58
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,107
- You're all set.
- I love you too, Barney.

59
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,706
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

60
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:27,943
Thank you.

61
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,826
- Ooh!
- Oh!

62
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,506
Jefe!

63
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,746
Donna, your lunch
appointment has arrived.

64
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:37,987
She's in the waiting area.

65
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,426
We need to update our
file on the Pamona case.

66
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,666
Per our conversation this morning,

67
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,706
I finally convinced Munson
to get off the dime.

68
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,386
He's agreed to extend
an offered settlement

69
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:47,786
to the amount of 1.5,
structured over three years.

70
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,066
First payment due at signing.

71
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,066
Tell him we'll agree to it. If he
tries to counter, shut him down.

72
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,586
I need the Amato file.

73
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,776
Here.

74
00:06:57,387 --> 00:06:59,346
Give this to Murray and
get it back to me.

75
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,186
He's got to initial it by
noon today. Thank you.

76
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,422
You notice I'm never late.

77
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,784
And I've got two kids.

78
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:14,788
I wondered why you had all those
pictures of children on your desk.

79
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:17,096
Oh, shit.

80
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,295
Tom!

81
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,546
- Get this filed away.
- Yes, sir, right away.

82
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:39,626
I also need 20 copies of each of these
for the Harcourt presentation tomorrow.

83
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,227
Also.. Sorry, hi.

84
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,626
I went ahead and I included
Prophidil heart attack victims, uh,

85
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:46,746
along with the stroke patients
already in the class.

86
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,627
Case goes to trial tomorrow.

87
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:51,026
Our lead witness decided to
go on a suicidal rampage

88
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,386
at the defendant's
office on Tuesday.

89
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,906
So I don't have time
for innovation.

90
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,946
One motion, and it's done.

91
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:57,866
And defense won't mind 'cause
they're gonna be hearing from

92
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,183
- the heart attacks sooner or later anyway.
- Tom..

93
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,783
We work off a 40 cut of whatever
the court awards the plaintiffs.

94
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,225
Lifetime care cost of each
stroke victim is millions.

95
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:11,106
Burial cost of your heart
attack victim is 10,000 bucks.

96
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,865
Got it, got it.

97
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,623
You think you're doing
the right thing, Tom.

98
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,466
The one great aspect of
this justice system is that

99
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,897
there is a market for
all kinds of cases.

100
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:24,544
Large firms, like us, will take
care of the expensive victims.

101
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,987
Small ones can take care
of your heart attacks.

102
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,580
Psst! Tom!

103
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,065
I think he likes you.

104
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,626
It doesn't matter anyway.

105
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:42,306
The case is a bust after the
whistleblower went postal.

106
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:45,946
No case is a bust when you're billing
out a $12 an hour paralegal,

107
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,666
at $65 an hour.

108
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:52,179
Christ, Roger, they're only
paying you $12 an hour? Ouch!

109
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,906
Now we'll preview the
unredacted versions..

110
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:59,179
Jack, meet your client in
conference room B, please.

111
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,067
Your memo's on Moyers' desk.

112
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:04,145
Oh, you're my hero..
Heroine, heroine.

113
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,416
This is Tom.

114
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,707
Yes, sir, right away.

115
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,506
Looks like I'm gonna be joining
you on the Gambizzi case.

116
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,106
Oh, yeah? How's that?

117
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,546
I submitted a memo this morning.

118
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:24,146
Moyers wants to see
me in his office.

119
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,986
Hey, uh, speaking of heart attacks,

120
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:29,786
she is wearing the form fitted
gray thing that is just..

121
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,426
- You're so gross, Roger.
- ..unbelievable.

122
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:33,345
You gonna talk to her this time?

123
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:35,505
If you do, tell her I
want my boxers back.

124
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,222
He's ready for you.

125
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:42,736
- Tom?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,982
Shirt's untucked.

127
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,737
Come in.

128
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,346
You wanna see me, sir?

129
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:53,666
Yeah, Tom, hey! Thanks for
coming. Here, take a seat.

130
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,266
Thanks.

131
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,267
Never been in here before.

132
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,666
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's cool.

133
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,866
Yeah, it's nice, huh?
225 square feet.

134
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,506
- Nice.
- And fifth biggest office in the building.

135
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:05,667
Yeah.

136
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:09,065
So, Tom, this memo on Gambizzi..

137
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,146
It's all your own work? No one
helped you or advised you?

138
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,780
It's a fascinating case.

139
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,986
Yes.

140
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,466
I really feel like there's a spousal
privilege aspect to the case

141
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,706
that's been overlooked.

142
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:22,706
And so I hope the memo helps
shed some light on different..

143
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,143
I don't understand.

144
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:36,506
Tom, when you neglect the
cases that we assign you,

145
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,027
you neglect the client.

146
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:41,386
Without the client,
all of this, it disappears.

147
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,107
Gambizzi's small fry.

148
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,667
It's cases like Harcourt v. Denning
that keep the lights on.

149
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,099
- I understand.
- Do you?

150
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,899
Emmerich wants a follow-up
with you later.

151
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,219
Awesome. Thanks.

152
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,346
Yeah, anytime, Tom.

153
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:14,186
Mr. Ryan, please hold
for Miss Higgins.

154
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,582
Mr. Ryan, please hold
for Miss Higgins.

155
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,979
So long, Harcourt.

156
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:15,103
- Oh, hey, Thomas.
- Oh, hey, Anna.

157
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:19,302
The Xerox machines in the copy room
were all occupied so I just..

158
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,626
Oh, well, I noticed some files out of place
the other day, so can I show you those?

159
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,704
Yeah, that's.. Yeah.

160
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:33,625
- You said you quit.
- Tough day.

161
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:34,986
Moyers didn't like the memo?

162
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,066
He shredded it, in front of me.

163
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,505
Thanks for the support.

164
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:44,426
How's that for support?

165
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:45,786
That's a little better.

166
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:47,306
The guy's a total loser.

167
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,786
You should seriously not
care what he thinks.

168
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,586
Yeah, I don't care what he thinks.

169
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,382
I do care what Emmerich thinks.

170
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,907
Now he wants to follow up
with me this afternoon.

171
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,626
Okay. Okay, here's what you do.

172
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:06,582
You apologize, you act sincere, and
then you forget it ever happened, okay?

173
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,626
- Don't take it personally.
- I know.

174
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,747
Listen, everyone's always gonna
have to answer to someone.

175
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,066
Emmerich doesn't.

176
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,187
- Ever met his wife?
- Well, that's true.

177
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,906
Good news is I get fired, we
can stop sneaking around.

178
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:22,860
You get fired, and I'm dumping you.

179
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:27,736
That wasn't funny.

180
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,066
So not funny, not
funny, not right now.

181
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,146
It's kind of.

182
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,226
Come on, babe, it's kind of funny.

183
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,826
Come here.

184
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,579
- You're so mean.
- Shh.

185
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,657
I gotta get that.

186
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,458
Hey, don't take it personally.

187
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,221
Chin up.

188
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,698
How many of those do they need?

189
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,256
Hey, hey!

190
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:35,703
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,185
Okay, everybody listen up.

192
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:03,420
RBE goes to trial against Denning
Pharmaceutical tomorrow.

193
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:07,746
I don't need to remind you what a big
day it's going to be for all of us.

194
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:10,866
I know how frustrating it's
been having the servers down.

195
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:14,139
There's not a lot more work
we can get done tonight.

196
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,256
I want everybody to go home.

197
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,658
- Tom.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:35,419
The memo you wrote on Gambizzi
references the witness list.

199
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:38,866
If I hadn't caught this before
all our discovery was filed,

200
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:41,066
it would have been submitted
to the district clerk.

201
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,466
That exhibit would have been
unsealed, allowing access

202
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:47,266
to the names and addresses of everyone
who's turning state's evidence

203
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,583
against the Gambizzi crime family.

204
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

205
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,105
You're a paralegal.

206
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,140
There's a lot you don't know, but
I don't have a problem with that.

207
00:15:58,427 --> 00:15:59,696
Hmm.

208
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:02,581
I do have a problem with
you acting like you do.

209
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,578
This is your last day at RBE, Tom.

210
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,619
Tom. I'm sorry.

211
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,936
Sorry.

212
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:50,066
- Hey, Mom.
- Babe, I'm so sorry.

213
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,226
It's okay.

214
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,027
Let's go get a drink tonight,
okay? Just you and me.

215
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,186
Okay.

216
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,226
I'm heading out now, but meet me
at Mahoney's at like 11:00, okay?

217
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:57,576
Bye.

218
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,506
- Moving back in with mom and dad?
- Something like that.

219
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,906
- Hey, Tom.
- Barney.

220
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,066
Sorry to hear what happened, man.

221
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,383
Appreciate it. I'll miss you, pal.

222
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,428
You'll always have
memories of the file room.

223
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,943
Pass card log.

224
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,341
She was never far behind you.

225
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,027
What was he talking about?

226
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:17,187
- I've maybe, possibly been seeing Anna.
- What?

227
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:19,026
For like, three months.

228
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:20,467
Oh, my God.

229
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,987
You're not serious.

230
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:23,106
Ugh!

231
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,581
I wanna get fired.

232
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,747
Oh, you know what?
I'll take the next one.

233
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:28,906
I gotta grab something on my desk.

234
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,946
- You want me to wait for you?
- No, no, go ahead.

235
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,742
- Go see your secret girlfriend.
- Ha..ha.

236
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:48,022
Hey.

237
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,584
Didn't waste any time.

238
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,746
Hey, Frank.

239
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,867
This isn't working.
Can you swipe me up?

240
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:58,661
- You got it, boss.
- I'll just leave this here for two seconds.

241
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,262
Hey, Jefe.

242
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,788
You didn't see a guy walking
around in a suit, did you?

243
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,462
Yeah.

244
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,617
What are you doing at my desk, pal?

245
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,544
They canceled my pass card.

246
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,186
- Hey!
- Hey, stupid pass card's not working.

247
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:30,661
Oh, okay.

248
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:34,584
- So you're still here?
- Yeah, yeah, I tried to leave but, uh..

249
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:37,946
I just had a lot of work
I had to catch up on.

250
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:40,306
Hey, you didn't see a lawyer
walking around here, did you?

251
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,426
No. Why?

252
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,226
What are you still doing here?

253
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,703
- Just wanted one more look at the place.
- Oh.

254
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:51,186
So what are you working on?

255
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:56,142
Oh, you know what, uh, Emmerich is
really invested in that Gambizzi case.

256
00:22:56,267 --> 00:23:00,026
- So he's got me working here late.
- Right, right, right, right.

257
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:01,546
Argh!

258
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,747
Yep!

259
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:05,936
Tom!

260
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:07,463
Get this filed away.

261
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:21,856
All right.

262
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,426
I'm really gone this time.

263
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,226
Okay.

264
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:27,666
You want me to let you out?

265
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:30,346
No, I'll take the scenic
route, old time's sake.

266
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:31,775
All right.

267
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:35,263
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,026
Take care.

269
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:41,345
Yeah. Don't work too hard
on that Gambizzi case.

270
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,745
Can I help you with something?

271
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:22,787
I'm with contractor services.

272
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:25,378
They sent me up to fix a short.

273
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:26,866
You mean building maintenance?

274
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,547
That's it.

275
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:29,986
Oh, well, no one told
me anything about it.

276
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,178
Um, do you mind if
I see your badge?

277
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:33,856
I forgot it.

278
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,388
They called me up at last minute.

279
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,909
I just wanna get this
done and get out of here.

280
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:44,141
Oh, I'm gonna have to
call Jerry about this.

281
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,227
Let's not bother Jerry.

282
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:52,179
What did you say your name..

283
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:26,538
Come on you, let's go.

284
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:29,024
You're not helping, are you?

285
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:47,985
Come on, Tom.

286
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:49,866
Who's in there?

287
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,739
Hello. Excuse me?

288
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,176
Barney?

289
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,746
How you doing in there, Barney?

290
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,619
You wanna toss me your keys?

291
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,188
I promise to take good care of it.

292
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:30,301
Okay, I'll have these.
Thank you, Barney.

293
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,860
Stay there.

294
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,306
- Tom!
- Roger.

295
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,907
- What are you still doing here?
- Keep your voice down.

296
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:46,066
- Keep my voice down?
- There's a guy

297
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,266
on the floor, he just
killed Janine and Barney.

298
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,347
What are you talking about?

299
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:49,546
Roger, we gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

300
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:50,866
Okay, well, what did he look like?

301
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:53,426
I don't know. Six foot,
180, he's wearing a suit.

302
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,186
That's everyone in this city.

303
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:28,421
It's dead.

304
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,300
Janine.

305
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:47,506
Shit!

306
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:49,826
Shit! We're trapped.

307
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:52,906
Look, he doesn't know we're here. Worst
case scenario, we hide out till he leaves.

308
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:55,338
Worst case scenario is he
finds us and kills us.

309
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,506
Get on a computer, see if you
can get online or something.

310
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,027
Okay.

311
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:29,857
- Tom, the Internet..
- Shut up!

312
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,747
Okay, here's the plan.

313
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,146
Take the long route around to
the far side of the bullpen.

314
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:37,587
Get to your desk, call the cops.

315
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:38,946
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find Emmerich.

316
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,467
No, listen to me.

317
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:43,146
Forget Emmerich. Forget doing
the right thing for once.

318
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,386
He wouldn't save us.

319
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,546
- God damn it..
- Roger, will you shut up and listen to me?

320
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,306
None of that matters now, okay?

321
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,146
You have kids at home,
keep it together.

322
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:51,780
Let's go.

323
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,136
Give me this.

324
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,701
Hey, hey, hey!

325
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,668
This isn't how I thought my
day was going to go, either.

326
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:11,347
So you're gonna take the one pass card
we have, you're gonna find a phone,

327
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,387
I'm gonna get Emmerich, and we're
gonna get out of here, okay?

328
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:15,187
- Okay.
- Okay?

329
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:16,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

330
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:43,939
Where'd you go?

331
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,426
Hi, honey.

332
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:01,146
- Sarah, hey. It's me, listen, honey..
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,346
Honey, do you want me to
keep your dinner warm?

334
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:05,266
Hold on a second.

335
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,986
Yes?

336
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,066
I'm with building maintenance.

337
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,466
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

338
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,067
Okay, um.. Thanks
for letting me know.

339
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:15,026
- I'm just on the phone right now.
- I'll wait.

340
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,378
Guys, quiet.
I'm talking to your dad.

341
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:21,746
- Are you okay?
- Hey! No, I'm fine.

342
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:25,706
I'm.. I'm at the office and..

343
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,506
I'm with someone right now.

344
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,746
You got any idea how many other
people are working late tonight?

345
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:30,866
- Hey, honey..
- Sir?

346
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,346
Oh, Elaine and Mike invited us to
go to the lake again on Saturday.

347
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,066
What do you want me to say to them?

348
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,546
Need to make sure nobody's trapped.

349
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,340
I'm out of excuses.

350
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:59,266
Oh, your books from Amazon came
in today. They only sent two.

351
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:02,266
Tell her you've been held up late
in office. You'll be home late.

352
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:03,706
They didn't send the
restaurant guide.

353
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:05,346
Hey, I'm, uh..

354
00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:08,585
I'm just stuck at the office,
I'm gonna be a little late.

355
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:17,586
Tell her everything's fine.
Kiss the kids night-night.

356
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:19,266
Are you sure everything's okay?

357
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:22,459
No, no. Everything's
fine. Uh, just..

358
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,946
Kiss the kids goodnight for me.

359
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:26,266
Okay, well..

360
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,387
Don't forget to tell
her you love her.

361
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,586
I love you, baby.

362
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:32,706
I love you too, honey.

363
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:35,341
Now hang up and put the
phone on the desk.

364
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:50,417
Oh, please. Please..

365
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,107
I didn't see anything. I..

366
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:59,460
Is anybody else
working late tonight?

367
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,861
No, no, it was.. It's just me.

368
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,743
Good. Good.

369
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,975
Roger?

370
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,299
Come on, come on, come on.

371
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,425
What the..

372
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:28,742
Ugh.

373
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,506
Come on. Come on.

374
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,938
Oh, goddamn iPhones.

375
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,943
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

376
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,906
I need to talk to you,

377
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:49,626
you have a problem.

378
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,260
Call me back.

379
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,260
Immediately.

380
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:13,386
Shit.

381
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,864
We have a situation.

382
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:25,337
Nobody was supposed to be up here.

383
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:27,506
Three.

384
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:28,856
And the one we spoke about.

385
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,867
I'll be in touch when it's done.

386
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:41,865
Tom?

387
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:47,461
Tom.

388
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,824
Tom.

389
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:05,303
You think this is a big office,
Tom, but it's about to get really,

390
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,303
really small.

391
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,866
There's only one way out.

392
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,022
And I've got the key.

393
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:19,983
I will find you, Tom.

394
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,626
I'll find you.

395
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:28,504
If I have to burn this place to
the ground, I will find you.

396
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,616
Come on.

397
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:16,742
Hey.

398
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,786
Yes, come on, come on.
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone!

399
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,579
Call the cops.

400
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:42,866
Wait.

401
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,466
I got it, I got it.

402
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,066
There, look, "9-1-1 ."

403
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:49,859
I got it, yes.

404
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,223
Yes, I'm going to shoot
that kid in the face.

405
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:54,737
Yes, I am. Yes.

406
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,107
Come on.

407
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:01,702
Oh, come on.

408
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:25,695
Yes, yeah.

409
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:27,096
Come on, come on.

410
00:44:28,427 --> 00:44:29,696
Yeah!

411
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:48,216
Got you.

412
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:16,860
Here goes nothing.

413
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,824
- Tom.
- Thank Christ.

414
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:30,346
Give me your cell phone.

415
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,346
- What.. what's going on?
- Excuse me, do you have a cell phone?

416
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:33,626
- Tom.
- We have to call the cops.

417
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:34,827
- Tom!
- There's a guy on the floor with a gun.

418
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:36,946
He killed three people. Can
you hurry up and call 9-1-1?

419
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:38,182
You said I'd be safe!

420
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,705
Shit.

421
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,626
- Alan Z. Emmerich?
- Oh, God!

422
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,465
Please, don't.

423
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,979
One of your employees, Tom,
reprogrammed the cards.

424
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,106
Please tell me there's another
card reader on this floor.

425
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:02,263
I don't believe so, no.

426
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:06,182
Oh..

427
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:11,103
This lawyer has started to seriously
affect my ability to do my job.

428
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:13,066
He's just a paralegal.

429
00:46:13,067 --> 00:46:14,747
Let him go, he's nobody.

430
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,942
Do not leave this office.

431
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:56,066
Who is she?

432
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,787
Lorraine Gambizzi.

433
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,580
Gambizzi's wife?

434
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:07,101
She was testifying
against her husband?

435
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,946
That's why he's here.

436
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:11,739
He must be one of Gambizzi's guys.

437
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:14,902
But if she's dead,
why isn't he leaving?

438
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:17,424
Maybe he is.

439
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:19,581
Doesn't sound like it.

440
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:34,616
What is he doing?

441
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:37,184
What does he want in the file room?

442
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,146
Well, he's not gonna
get in there that way.

443
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:43,305
That's reinforced steel and bulletproof
glass. That's impenetrable.

444
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:46,428
So the one room where we're safe is
the room where we can't get into.

445
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,337
It stopped.

446
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,386
Shit.

447
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:14,301
Tom?

448
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:16,502
Tom!

449
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:20,826
Look who I got.

450
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:22,506
Fernando.

451
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,260
See?

452
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:29,819
Tom, I just want to talk.

453
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,026
That's all, see.

454
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:33,866
I'm an employee.

455
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,297
Just like you, I've been hired

456
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:40,900
to do a job, and my boss isn't the
kind of man who accepts failure.

457
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:44,737
Don't try and be a hero, Tom.

458
00:48:45,427 --> 00:48:47,538
Nobody else has to die.

459
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:51,422
If you bring me the pass card,

460
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,587
I promise,

461
00:48:54,427 --> 00:48:56,345
I won't hurt Fernando.

462
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,136
If you don't..

463
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:04,026
I will decorate that
wall with his brains.

464
00:49:05,147 --> 00:49:06,860
What's his nickname?

465
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:09,466
What's his nickname?

466
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:11,101
What do I call him?

467
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,386
The janitor!

468
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:16,660
He's already dead.

469
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:26,216
It's been fun, Tom.

470
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:32,742
What's that?

471
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:35,183
He's turning the elevators back on.

472
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:38,819
He's trying to trick us.

473
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,140
Come on.

474
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:02,701
Stay here.

475
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,826
You heard it too?

476
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,541
Jesus Christ.

477
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:47,376
What is it?

478
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:49,336
It's my number.

479
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,057
Oh, shit!

480
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:03,265
Go, go, go!

481
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:40,581
Shit. Shit.

482
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,057
Oh, God.

483
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:00,702
This is gonna hurt.

484
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:02,346
You ready?

485
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:11,702
Nice phone.

486
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:28,746
You really should protect
your phone with a PIN.

487
00:52:28,747 --> 00:52:30,939
You wouldn't want
just anyone using it.

488
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:42,546
No!

489
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:43,666
No!

490
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:47,106
Hey, hey, hey, leave her out of this.
You already killed the other witness,

491
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:49,067
why are you doing it?
Why are you still here?

492
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:53,222
I'm gonna go let her in.

493
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:57,098
You got everything you wanted,
why are you doing this?

494
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,581
Not everything.

495
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:02,906
Hey! Hey, come back here!

496
00:53:02,907 --> 00:53:04,587
Hey, come back here
and listen to me!

497
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:05,986
You touch her, I'm gonna kill you.

498
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,586
Get back here!

499
00:53:07,587 --> 00:53:09,300
Hey! Hey!

500
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,426
What are you doing?

501
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:15,618
- Don't go out there.
- I have to.

502
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:17,306
He's got Anna.

503
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:18,657
He'll kill you.

504
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:21,902
No, he won't.

505
00:53:22,387 --> 00:53:24,259
I'm gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

506
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:38,986
Hi. I bet your name's Anna.

507
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:40,107
And who are you?

508
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:41,866
I'm the new guy,

509
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:44,627
and I'm having a
really bad first day.

510
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:48,546
What are you doing?

511
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:51,627
Give me your cell phone.

512
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,260
Please.

513
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,982
Thank you.

514
00:54:08,147 --> 00:54:09,336
Let her go.

515
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:11,826
Oh, hello.

516
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:13,226
Let her go and I'll
give you what you want.

517
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:14,746
Tom!

518
00:54:14,747 --> 00:54:16,747
Anna, baby, it's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.

519
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:18,858
Just a friendly exchange.

520
00:54:19,187 --> 00:54:21,855
Something you want for
something I want.

521
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,346
Aw, cute.

522
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,786
You've really thought this
through, haven't you?

523
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:27,146
Now, I don't like the way this is
going, all I gotta do is make a cut

524
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,507
and it's game over, you lose.

525
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:30,625
We both lose.

526
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:33,306
Except, one of us will be able
to live with the outcome,

527
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,826
and one of us will not.

528
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:36,627
I don't believe that's true.

529
00:54:36,628 --> 00:54:37,906
Emmerich, what are
you doing? Emmerich.

530
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,507
- I'm taking a risk..
- Emmerich, I've got this.

531
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:41,220
as an act of good faith.

532
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:44,946
You've been trying to
get into our file room.

533
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,946
I think you have a job to do,
and you intend to see it through.

534
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:49,136
Am I right?

535
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:53,186
But I am confident that if you
were to put your gun down

536
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:55,776
then Tom would throw out that card.

537
00:54:55,987 --> 00:54:57,906
Then both parties

538
00:54:57,907 --> 00:55:01,703
would be confident in the good
faith of these negotiations.

539
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:11,705
Your turn.

540
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:22,816
Now, let her go.

541
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:28,626
That's not gonna work for me,
I want him to bring it to me.

542
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:33,106
- For God's sake, let's just get this done..
- No, Emmerich!

543
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:34,501
Emmerich, what are you doing?

544
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:38,666
Now, let her go.

545
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:43,666
Sorry, I'm renegotiating.

546
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,220
No!

547
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,775
Get up.

548
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:03,699
After you.

549
00:56:09,228 --> 00:56:10,941
You shot me!

550
00:56:14,148 --> 00:56:16,020
You might just live.

551
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,744
You're supposed to be the boss!

552
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:22,106
How hard is it to clear
out your own office?

553
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:24,425
Just get this done so I
can go to the hospital.

554
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:33,817
Come on.

555
00:56:48,787 --> 00:56:50,136
Let him go, or I shoot.

556
00:56:50,228 --> 00:56:51,462
You won't do that.

557
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:54,343
Yeah? Try me.

558
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:03,576
Anna, now!

559
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:11,427
What are you doing?
You can't go in there!

560
00:58:11,428 --> 00:58:13,379
Go get that fire extinguisher.

561
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:25,346
- Oh, shit.
- Tom.

562
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:27,937
Yeah, give that to me. Stay back.

563
00:59:04,347 --> 00:59:06,185
Tom!

564
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:17,306
Get off him!

565
00:59:18,707 --> 00:59:20,057
Hey!

566
00:59:23,507 --> 00:59:25,504
You got no clue who you're..

567
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,104
11-22.

568
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,386
Tom.

569
01:00:07,387 --> 01:00:08,786
- You okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

570
01:00:08,787 --> 01:00:10,022
Yeah.

571
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:14,782
- I'll get the elevator started.
- Yeah.

572
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:19,067
I guess Harcourt's not
going to trial today, huh?

573
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:28,981
Holy shit.

574
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,744
This has nothing to
do with Gambizzi.

575
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:28,266
This is why he broke in the office.

576
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,866
Denning hired him

577
01:01:29,908 --> 01:01:31,506
to destroy the Harcourt file.

578
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:33,266
- Tom..
- This is proof!

579
01:01:33,267 --> 01:01:36,106
Denning knew that Prophidil could harm
people, and they released it anyway.

580
01:01:36,107 --> 01:01:38,457
Tom, I need you to
call me an ambulance.

581
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:40,496
Okay.

582
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:51,983
11-22.

583
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,506
We have a situation.

584
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:29,626
Nobody was supposed to be up here.

585
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:32,057
Three, and the one we talked about.

586
01:02:33,227 --> 01:02:34,463
It was you.

587
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:38,623
What, you were throwing
the case for Denning?

588
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:42,423
- The money was just a way out.
- A way out of what?

589
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:45,144
Think of this more as a settlement.

590
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,066
Oh, don't be so naive.

591
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:50,426
Every lawyer has a price, even you.

592
01:02:50,428 --> 01:02:51,826
I'm not a lawyer.

593
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:52,986
You can be.

594
01:02:52,987 --> 01:02:57,026
You can go wherever you want at
RBE, Tom. I will make sure of that.

595
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,457
Well, I want a raise. A big one!

596
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:02,336
And a corner office.

597
01:03:03,627 --> 01:03:05,306
And then, I want to watch

598
01:03:05,307 --> 01:03:09,819
when you tell Roger's wife and kids
that you had him murdered for money.

599
01:03:10,827 --> 01:03:12,017
You fuck.

600
01:03:12,908 --> 01:03:16,306
It was supposed to be an electrical fire!
No one was supposed to get hurt!

601
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:17,906
Then why did he have a gun?

602
01:03:18,268 --> 01:03:20,986
Why did he call you and say "Three,
and the one we talked about"?

603
01:03:20,987 --> 01:03:24,259
"The one we talked about"?
That was Roger, wasn't it?

604
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,306
Roger found this, brought this
to you and you had him killed.

605
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:30,498
No, I am not a killer.

606
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:32,664
No, you just pay other
people to do it for you.

607
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:35,096
It's easier.

608
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:37,825
Shred that file.

609
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,977
You think the Mafia is scary?

610
01:03:42,107 --> 01:03:45,140
Wait till you see what a multi-billion
dollar corporation will do.

611
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:49,266
Denning has people
everywhere, in every firm,

612
01:03:49,268 --> 01:03:52,379
every police precinct,
every governmental agency.

613
01:03:52,907 --> 01:03:56,226
If you don't shred that file,
they will come for you.

614
01:03:56,227 --> 01:03:57,417
Why would they?

615
01:03:57,787 --> 01:03:59,261
You fired me.

616
01:03:59,707 --> 01:04:00,942
Remember?

617
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,466
I clocked out at 9:00.

618
01:04:06,147 --> 01:04:08,907
Thanks to you, I couldn't
even swipe back up again.

619
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:11,863
Go.

620
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:26,264
Reported gunshots
fired, 34th floor.

621
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:31,186
- Hey.
- Tom!

622
01:05:31,187 --> 01:05:32,947
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

623
01:05:32,948 --> 01:05:34,262
Hi.

624
01:05:34,987 --> 01:05:37,906
- Okay. We've gotta get out of here.
- Okay.

625
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:45,102
Hey, where's Emmerich?

626
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:51,826
Check the perimeter offices,
if you find anyone, detain them.

627
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:53,585
I'll get some backup.

628
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,504
What did you do with the file?

629
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:05,746
What I do best.

630
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,347
Morning, sir.

631
01:06:32,348 --> 01:06:33,869
Morning, how are you doing today?

632
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,547
I'm gonna call in sick,
give me your cell phone.

633
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,146
If anybody asks,

634
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,986
- we were never here.
- Okay.

635
01:07:34,707 --> 01:07:36,022
Yeah?

636
01:07:37,747 --> 01:07:39,619
What does he look like?

637
01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:45,387
Got him.

638
01:07:45,389 --> 01:07:57,000
