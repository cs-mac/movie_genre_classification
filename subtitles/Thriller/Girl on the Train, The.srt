1
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,736
My husband
used to tell me

2
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,354
I have an overactive
imagination.

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,555
I can't help it.

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,195
I mean, haven't you
ever been on a train

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,999
and wondered about the lives of the
people who live near the tracks?

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,114
The lives
you've never lived.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,880
These are things
I want to know.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,675
Twice a day, I sit in the
third car from the front

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,991
where I have the perfect
view into my favorite house.

10
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,838
Number 15 Beckett Road.

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,750
I don't know when exactly.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,515
I suppose I started noticing
her about a year ago,

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,030
and gradually,
as the months went past,

14
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,309
she became important to me.

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,430
I'm not the girl
I used to be.

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,437
I think people can
see it on my face.

17
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,359
She's what I lost.

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,510
She's everything
I want to be.

19
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,676
I imagine
she's a painter.

20
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,273
She's creative.

21
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,315
He is a doctor
or an architect.

22
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,792
He has a good laugh.

23
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,073
She can't cook.

24
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,478
I wonder what they say to each
other before they go to sleep.

25
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,397
Today, her name is Jess.

26
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,790
Tomorrow,
it could be Lisa or Amber.

27
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,152
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.

28
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,920
The truth is,
I don't know her name.

29
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,556
I don't know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.

30
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,997
I just know they know love.

31
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,678
Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember

32
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,591
the last time I had
meaningful contact

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,113
with another person.

34
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,675
I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett Road.

35
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,680
No!

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,676
It was my first home.

37
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,437
We bought it together.
It was ours.

38
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,314
Every day I tell myself
not to look.

39
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,711
But then I look.

40
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,829
Are you alone?

41
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,873
Yeah. No.
Come. It's all yours.

42
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,269
Okay.

43
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,316
Your baby's so cute.
Oh, thank you.

44
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,435
Hi, baby!

45
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,754
Is it a boy?

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Yeah!

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,875
So sweet! How old is he?

48
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,916
- Six months.
- Six months.

49
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,079
So sweet.

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Shh.

51
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,837
A teacher once told me I was
a mistress of self-reinvention.

52
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,517
I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.

53
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
But since moving here,
I've come to understand it.

54
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,399
Ardsley-on-Hudson
is boring and routine.

55
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,949
It's a fucking baby factory.

56
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,189
I wanna start my life
over again.

57
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,399
So far, I've been
a rebellious teenager,

58
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,469
lover,

59
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,998
waitress,

60
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,316
gallery director,

61
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,069
nanny,

62
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,198
and a whore.

63
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,155
And not necessarily
in that order.

64
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,920
I can't just be
a wife anymore.

65
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,514
That's why I stay awake at night,
staring at the ceiling.

66
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,874
In fact, the only time I feel
like myself is when I'm running.

67
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,034
You always
felt that way?

68
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,590
Maybe since I was about 17.

69
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,792
Hmm.
With Mac.

70
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,709
Mac?

71
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,593
Who's Mac?

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,271
My brother's best friend.

73
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,198
My brother who died.

74
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,154
I tend to smile
when I'm nervous.

75
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,231
Sometimes I laugh.

76
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,274
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

77
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,432
We started fucking.

78
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,830
We were the saddest
people we knew.

79
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,839
But in a way,
that cabin made us happy.

80
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,717
No one could find us.

81
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,355
Everyone thought
we were dead.

82
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,158
And if you were
to run away today,

83
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,435
right now,
where would you go?

84
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,630
I read once that
when a train hits,

85
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,280
it can rip the clothes
right off of you.

86
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,988
I'm pretty sure
Scott thinks the nanny job

87
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,991
is gonna make me
less restless.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,150
Make me wanna get pregnant.

89
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,591
And that's not the case?

90
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,759
When I finish
work every night,

91
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,671
I run home
and I get in the shower,

92
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,150
and I wash the smell of that
baby off of me as fast as I can.

93
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Ah.

94
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,914
When you woke up
this morning,

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,037
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

96
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,919
And when I was feeding you,

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,276
we heard Daddy singing from
the kitchen, didn't we?

98
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,155
Happy birthday to you

99
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,238
Happy birthday to you

100
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,911
Happy birthday, dear Anna

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,468
Happy birthday to you

102
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,431
Oh. Daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

103
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,750
that he made for Mommy,
didn't he?

104
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,279
Yes, he did.

105
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,355
Thank you, Megan.

106
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,398
There you go.

107
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,316
Shh, shh, shh.

108
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,750
Ooh, hello.

109
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,957
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

110
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,873
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!

111
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,231
You're not sleeping!

112
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Hello?

113
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
You're not sleeping.

114
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,389
Hello?

115
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,669
Hello?

116
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,919
Is that another hang-up?
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,035
And grab the corners.

118
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
And straight.

119
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,398
I got another job.

120
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
You what?

121
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,679
I'm really sorry, Anna.

122
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,034
I thought you were
happy here.

123
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,872
I mean,
you seemed happy here.

124
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,598
I am.

125
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,750
It's just this isn't
what I do.

126
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,999
Take care of children?

127
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,109
Or laundry.

128
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,036
Another gallery
headhunted me.

129
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,352
That's great.

130
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,590
The thing is,
it starts tomorrow.

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,350
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.

132
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,510
I hate to leave you
like this without childcare,

133
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,278
but you don't have a job.

134
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,471
Okay,
that sounded wrong.

135
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,596
I know that you're busy
volunteering.

136
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,875
It's not the volunteering.

137
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,873
It's all the shopping, it's spending
hours in the farmers' market,

138
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,518
it's finding
the right foods for her,

139
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,874
it's pureeing
sweet potatoes,

140
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,155
and I do all of this
at the same time

141
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,039
as I'm nursing.

142
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,717
Maybe you should
go back to work, too.

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,710
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.

144
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,392
And how would you know?

145
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,148
Your key.

146
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,598
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

147
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,999
Megan, please.

148
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,589
Rachel!

149
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,035
What are you doing?
Give me my baby.

150
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,273
Rachel, what are you doing?

151
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,477
Hello?

152
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,473
Thank you.

153
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,553
Hmm. Beautiful.

154
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,388
How many times
has she texted you today?

155
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,229
I don't know.

156
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,436
She called the landline
three times.

157
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Oh.

158
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,595
You have to talk to her.

159
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I know.

160
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,789
It's getting crazy.

161
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,558
I will. I know,
I know, I know.

162
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,594
Okay.

163
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,795
It's gonna be fine.

164
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,673
Isn't it always fine?

165
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,273
Don't I always
make everything fine?

166
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,713
Stop!

167
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,317
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.

168
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,216
Are you sure you don't want
me to take you out tonight?

169
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,196
No, I like it at home.
Call Megan.

170
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,952
Ask her to come back.

171
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,473
She just quit.

172
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,993
She what?

173
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,832
She just told me
she got another job.

174
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Huh.

175
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Shame.

176
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,600
I thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

177
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Mmm.

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,954
So did I.

179
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,856
Hey, it's Tom.
Sorry I missed you.

180
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,279
I'll get right back to you.

181
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,316
Hey, Tom. It's me.

182
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,109
Uh, I just wanted to wish
Momma a happy birthday.

183
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,713
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!

184
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,314
Jesus.

185
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
No, no, no.

186
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,756
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it. Relax.

187
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Cathy, come on!
Relax!

188
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,070
I just need some to go
to sleep, that's all.

189
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,072
I just need a little bit
to go to sleep.

190
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,599
What brought this on?

191
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,117
He posted another
picture of the baby.

192
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,428
It was a cute picture.

193
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,919
- Yeah?
- Yup.

194
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,395
Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not
make good friends.

195
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,588
I got it. I got it.

196
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,836
All right.
Let's get you to your room.

197
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,079
Rachel, you have to
stop calling them, okay?

198
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,310
I really appreciate
this room.

199
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,472
I do.

200
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,038
I thought that
I would just be here

201
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,954
for a couple of weeks
or months.

202
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,553
Yeah, that was
two years ago.

203
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,593
Get some sleep.

204
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,949
IVF rarely works
the first time.

205
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,633
Would you like a moment?

206
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,311
It's okay, sweetie.

207
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,075
We're gonna try again.

208
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,469
We can't afford
to do it again.

209
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,592
When we can, we will.

210
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,873
I wonder what
she's looking at.

211
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,599
Or if she even sees
this train at all.

212
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,389
Who is that man?

213
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,112
What is she doing?

214
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,598
She's throwing it all away.

215
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,994
Anna, I fell asleep
last night thinking of you.

216
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,389
I dreamed about kissing
the inside of your thighs

217
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,550
and holding your breasts.

218
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,756
God, I wish I was
fucking you right now.

219
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,556
Anna, I love you.

220
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,591
I love you so much.

221
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,399
When it happened to me,
I found dozens of e-mails.

222
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,910
Tom told her that he'd never
felt like this before.

223
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,436
He said it wouldn't be that much
longer until they were together.

224
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,509
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.

225
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,199
I was stupid.

226
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,196
But when I, um...

227
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,430
When I saw it was
from the realtor,

228
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,193
I thought that
it was just spam.

229
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,795
And then I realized that
they were kisses, not X's.

230
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,190
And my husband was fucking
a Century 21 agent.

231
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,679
That sucks.
It does.

232
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,638
Her name was Anna Boyd
and he was in love with her.

233
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,272
Come here for one second.

234
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,632
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

235
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,553
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

236
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,800
That bitch
is living in my house.

237
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.

238
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,549
I picked the dining table,
the kitchen table.

239
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,756
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked Tom

240
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,798
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

241
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,757
I just wanna tell her.

242
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,156
I wish I could tell her.

243
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,276
I picked
everything in that house.

244
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,396
I fucking picked
everything in that house.

245
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,158
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

246
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,038
when I read that e-mail.

247
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,510
But this morning, I did.

248
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,953
I did.

249
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,914
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else, just I...

250
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,670
Betraying her husband,
I felt...

251
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,079
I felt it.

252
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,152
I felt pure rage.

253
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,510
It was like
something had been

254
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,795
taken from me again.

255
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,038
If I could...

256
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,032
If I could,
I'd just go to her house,

257
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,238
and I'd go and find her
sitting at the kitchen table,

258
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,673
and I'd just...

259
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,274
I'd wrap my hand in
her long blonde hair

260
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,753
and I'd jerk her head back.

261
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,751
I'd just jerk it back,

262
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,559
and then I'd pull her down
to the ground,

263
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,476
and I would just smash her
head all over the floor!

264
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,951
Move!
Get out of my way!

265
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Move!

266
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,149
Hey!

267
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Hey!

268
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,108
You whore!

269
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,558
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

270
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,631
What the hell is wrong with you?

271
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,794
I spent the past hour driving
around looking for you.

272
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,073
You scared
the shit out of Anna.

273
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,195
Do you know that?

274
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,151
She thought you were gonna...

275
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,990
She wanted to
call the police. So just...

276
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,472
Leave us alone.

277
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,112
You can ruin your own life
if you want to,

278
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,760
but you're not
gonna destroy ours.

279
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,274
I'm not gonna
protect you anymore.

280
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,914
Oh, my God.

281
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,796
Rachel? Open the door.

282
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,794
Cathy, I just need a sec.

283
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,438
Are you okay?

284
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,397
Rachel, open the door.

285
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,309
I have a stomach flu.

286
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,311
Okay? I just...
You don't have a flu.

287
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,789
What the fuck, Rachel?

288
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,029
I'm not stupid!

289
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,311
Rachel!
Cathy, just go away!

290
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,389
Come here for one second.
Just one second.

291
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,992
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."

292
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,275
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

293
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,348
You whore!

294
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,589
No!

295
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,916
Anyone counting days 1 to 90,
who would like to share a day count?

296
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,816
- Hey, I'm Jason. I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.

297
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,512
I've got 22 days back.

298
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,194
Anyone else?

299
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,670
Hi. I'm Rachel and...

300
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,080
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.

301
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,153
Thank you.
This is day one, I suppose.

302
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Um...

303
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,670
I'm here because I...

304
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,519
Because I...

305
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,591
Because I woke up,
um, covered in blood.

306
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,438
And I had bruises
all over my arm, um...

307
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,510
It's usually from when I've fallen
and someone's helped me up.

308
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,313
My husband...

309
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,590
He used to tell me what I'd
done the night before.

310
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,869
And I learned when you wake up like
that, you just say you're sorry.

311
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,955
You just say you're sorry
for what you did,

312
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,310
and you're sorry
for who you are,

313
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,630
and you're never
gonna do it again.

314
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,950
But you do. You do it again.

315
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,835
And there's time missing.

316
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,518
I need to remember.

317
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,478
I need to remember.

318
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,077
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.

319
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Thank you, Rachel.

320
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,073
Right?
It was that, um...

321
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,479
The homeless thing.

322
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,960
I don't remember
what it was called.

323
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,229
Oh, Safe Shelter.

324
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,038
That was
a tube top, right?

325
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,439
Yep, it was.

326
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,873
Why say,
"Yes, I'm gonna go.

327
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,190
"And I can't wait because
it's fun to dress up."

328
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,349
Then dress up.

329
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,616
Do you like
devil's eggs, Martha?

330
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,551
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

331
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Deviled eggs.

332
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,016
Thank you
for making them.

333
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,155
The classics.
Do you wanna try one, anybody?

334
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,176
Those go outside. I don't want
the eggs with the dessert.

335
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,191
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

336
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,616
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?

337
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,915
Or you can put a couple with
your quinoa if you want to.

338
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,016
Do you wanna put them with your
other salad and your corn?

339
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,600
Rachel.
Put a couple on the wall...

340
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,795
Rachel!

341
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,589
I'm fine, Tom! Stop it.

342
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,511
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

343
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,318
You never have my back.

344
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,470
That's my boss's wife.

345
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,879
Probably got me
fired back there.

346
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,956
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.

347
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,758
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

348
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,233
You never fucking support me.

349
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,594
Rachel, please stop it!

350
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,955
Hey, come on!
I need you to focus here.

351
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,230
- Don't fucking talk to me like that!
- Relax!

352
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,160
- Rachel. There you are.
- Cathy, I'm sorry.

353
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,713
I need to get
my shit together.

354
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,239
You must be Ms. Watson.

355
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,918
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.

356
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,792
We need to ask you
a few questions.

357
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,632
What's this about?

358
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,559
Wanna sit down?

359
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,470
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

360
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,359
I was at work in the city,
and then...

361
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,635
And then I went
to visit my husband.

362
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,233
You mean your ex-husband?

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,476
Yeah. So I got off the train
at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then...

364
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,274
and then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

365
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,510
Around what time did you
reach that conclusion?

366
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,237
I was back here by 11:00.

367
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,112
Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,311
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

369
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
No.

370
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
And what time did you
take the train there?

371
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,308
Um, 6:00.

372
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,154
So, what'd you do during
those hours in Ardsley,

373
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,071
if you weren't
seeing your ex-husband?

374
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you remember
seeing this woman?

375
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,553
She worked
for your ex-husband.

376
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,358
She's gone missing.

377
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,759
What do you mean
she's missing?

378
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,751
Her husband said
she never came back home

379
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,752
the same night you got off the
train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

380
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,109
I was just...

381
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,191
- Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!

382
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,919
- Did you see her?
- No, I don't think so.

383
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,911
Is that because
you were inebriated?

384
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,869
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

385
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,157
Are you referring to your
job in public relations?

386
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,389
Right.

387
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,080
It's my understanding you were fired
from that job over a year ago

388
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,759
because of your
drinking problem.

389
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,029
Okay.
That's enough for now.

390
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,235
If you're able to remember
anything else, give us a call.

391
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,038
Did you really get fired?

392
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,096
Look, I didn't want you to worry
that I couldn't pay the rent.

393
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,192
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

394
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,910
I ride the train.

395
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,069
You what?

396
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,913
I ride the train
to New York and back.

397
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,669
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?

398
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,070
That's really
fucking weird, Rachel.

399
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,513
Okay, okay.

400
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,278
I got on the train,
and then... and then I got off the train.

401
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,715
I don't know.
It's very unclear.

402
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,677
You don't remember
anything, do you?

403
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,639
You know, I read about this man in
Long Island who blacked out.

404
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,118
He left a bar...

405
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,176
...drove to the
house that he'd grown up in,

406
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,156
stabbed its
occupants to death.

407
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,640
He woke up the next morning
oblivious to what he did,

408
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,816
until the police
came to get him.

409
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Rachel!

410
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,199
What? What?

411
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,157
You have to leave.

412
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,016
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...

413
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,155
Hold on.

414
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,875
Hold on.

415
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,478
Detective Riley?

416
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,629
Yeah, I agree with you.

417
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,438
Detective Riley?

418
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,832
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell,
but not on Friday night.

419
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,034
She was having an affair.
She had a lover.

420
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,216
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

421
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,639
I thought
you didn't know her.

422
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,517
No. But I saw her.

423
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,715
You saw her where?

424
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,989
I saw her from the train.

425
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,230
She was standing
on the deck with this man.

426
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,237
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No.

427
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,469
It wasn't him.

428
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,279
This man was different
and they were kissing.

429
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,873
Wow. That's pretty
coincidental, isn't it?

430
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,096
You just happen to be on a
train at the same exact moment

431
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,190
that a woman you don't know,
but somehow recognize

432
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,633
is cheating on her husband?

433
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,835
I know it sounds crazy.

434
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,994
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the
vicinity of her house Friday night.

435
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,913
Megan Hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

436
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,354
Mrs. Watson reported
that you go to their house

437
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,668
sometimes uninvited

438
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,435
and that on one occasion, you actually
broke in and took their child.

439
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,354
Let me give you some advice.

440
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,032
Don't go back
to Beckett Road.

441
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,350
Don't contact
your ex-husband.

442
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,193
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

443
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,349
Are you listening to me?

444
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,589
Yes.

445
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,194
You don't live there anymore.

446
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,473
Stay away.

447
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,950
You know,
I lie all the time.

448
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,038
I lie to Scott.

449
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,678
I lie to you.

450
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,319
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy,

451
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,310
but I have to
keep things vague.

452
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,313
Jumble up all the men,
the exes, the lovers.

453
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,758
It doesn't matter
who they are.

454
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,195
It matters how
they make me feel.

455
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,949
Lying is like
taking a trip.

456
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,516
It's like having a secret.

457
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,031
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

458
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,393
Except you.

459
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,509
But you're just pretending.

460
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,873
You're just pretending
to touch yourself.

461
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,113
Scott's possessive.

462
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,028
Jealous.

463
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,238
He likes to own me.

464
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,469
He figures out
all my passwords.

465
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,432
Which is kind of sexy.

466
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,668
So, when I came home
last night,

467
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,911
Scott was on my laptop,
wondering why...

468
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,592
Scott's behavior
is not normal.

469
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,796
It's a form
of emotional abuse.

470
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,232
Are you ever afraid
of Scott?

471
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,993
It's not abuse.

472
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,629
Not if you don't care,
and I don't.

473
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,549
Maybe it's become
a normal state for you.

474
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,149
Is it normal I think
about you all the time?

475
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,000
"Almost exactly

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,239
"to please come forward."

485
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,439
You Megan's friend?

486
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,317
Yes. Rachel.

487
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,435
Come in.

488
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,355
Do you want a coffee?

489
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,714
Uh, sure.
Thank you.

490
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,399
Sorry, it's a mess.

491
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,955
I've been hunting for her social,
her birth certificate.

492
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,515
The cops need a lot.

493
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,994
Have we met
somewhere before?

494
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,199
I don't think so.

495
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,554
And you know Megan from...

496
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,359
Uh, from the gallery.

497
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,709
Oh, you're an artist?

498
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,030
Uh, well,
I like to think so.

499
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,976
So you said on the phone
you wanted to tell me

500
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,718
something about Megan.

501
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,793
What did you wanna tell me?

502
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,556
I saw your wife with someone
on Friday morning.

503
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,789
With who?

504
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,999
She was up there
on your porch.

505
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,274
Um...

506
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,717
I saw her from the train, because
I commute to Manhattan every day

507
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,916
and I go
straight past here.

508
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
She kissed him.

509
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,953
They were kissing.

510
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,472
I'm sorry. I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

511
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,269
Yeah.

512
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,277
I know how it feels.

513
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Huh.

514
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,591
What did he look like?

515
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,352
He was average height.
He had dark hair.

516
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,876
And they were
out there on the porch?

517
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,075
Yes.

518
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,595
Fuck!

519
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,914
Fuck.

520
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,470
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you.

521
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,479
Okay, sure.

522
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,838
It could... I don't know.

523
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,114
Maybe it's a good thing.

524
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,836
Could mean she's all right.

525
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,158
She just ran off
with someone.

526
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,434
Right.

527
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,074
Has she talked to you?

528
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,433
Oh, no. Um,
I haven't heard anything.

529
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,795
You know her well enough
to know where we live.

530
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,677
Megan doesn't
have many friends.

531
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,831
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I...

532
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,473
We took... We took...

533
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,994
We took Pilates together.

534
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,039
I think I should go. I feel like
I've taken up too much of your time.

535
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,238
So sorry to have had to tell
you that in that way...

536
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Hey.

537
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,830
Do you think you'd recognize
him again if you saw him?

538
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,229
I don't know.

539
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,477
There's a guy. A therapist.

540
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,391
His name's, um,
Abdic...

541
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,835
Um, Kamal Abdic.

542
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,398
Is that who you saw?

543
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,990
I don't know.
I really can't tell.

544
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,599
She spends a lot of fucking
time with her shrink.

545
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,635
That's him.

546
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,597
I remember. That's him.

547
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,829
I remember. That's him.

548
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,353
I'm sorry.

549
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,793
Where are you?

550
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,795
Where are you?

551
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,194
Where are you?

552
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,273
Where are you?

553
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,999
Stay away from me.

554
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,960
This is so stupid.

555
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,832
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

556
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,796
And every time
we go there...

557
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,108
Where?

558
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,192
To that subject.

559
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,159
What subject?

560
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,269
Megan?

561
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,395
What subject?

562
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,748
It's okay.

563
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Megan.

564
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,589
Megan.

565
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,157
All right, Megan.

566
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,271
We shouldn't.

567
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
No.

568
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
Megan.

569
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,199
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

570
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,037
Megan, I could lose
my practice.

571
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,788
I don't give a fuck!

572
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,480
I don't give a fuck
about your fucking practice!

573
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,829
I don't give a...

574
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,198
Dr. Kamal Abdic has
been brought in for questioning

575
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,437
on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson
resident, Megan Hipwell.

576
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,874
He was, according to sources,
Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.

577
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,675
For the first time in ages,
I have purpose.

578
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,756
Or at least
I have a distraction.

579
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,196
I want Megan to show up
safe and sound. I do.

580
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,714
Yeah!

581
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,399
Just not quite yet.

582
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,709
Hi.

583
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,918
What's wrong?

584
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,718
Abdic's been released.

585
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,552
What?

586
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,198
There wasn't
enough evidence.

587
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,520
And because I'm the one that
got him arrested, he talked.

588
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,431
A lot.

589
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,511
They'll build
a case against him.

590
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,192
It'll just take some time.

591
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,510
Are you totally sure he's
the guy you saw Megan with?

592
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,715
Yes.

593
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,238
You sure as fuck better be.

594
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,548
I don't understand.

595
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,039
The police think I did it.

596
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
Yeah, but he's the one...

597
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,912
He told them
Megan's miserable.

598
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,833
That I'm a jealous,
controlling husband.

599
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,990
I'm sure that they're just
trying to rule you out.

600
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,310
Abdic told them
I'm abusive.

601
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,836
When she walked out,
I didn't go after her.

602
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,229
I never called
to check on her.

603
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,996
I went to a sports bar
for fuck's sake.

604
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,308
Got drunk.

605
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,597
No. We just need to find
more evidence on Abdic.

606
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,830
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

607
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,751
There's no e-mails,
there's nothing.

608
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,671
No letters, no e-mails.

609
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,034
Nothing.

610
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,595
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself.

611
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,712
Fucking phone won't stop!

612
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,710
This is Scott. Yeah, yeah.
Hold on. Hold on.

613
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,468
Do you mind?

614
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Oh!

615
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,833
Rachel, no.

616
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Anna, get in the house.

617
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,475
Your wife
hit me on Friday night.

618
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,079
No. What are you
talking about? Yes.

619
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,037
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did!

620
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,237
And then she...
She got in your car.

621
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,268
No. She said you yelled
at her that night.

622
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,713
No. That is not
what happened.

623
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,553
She was in the tunnel
and she hit me.

624
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,198
I don't wanna
argue on the street.

625
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,736
It's the middle of
the day and you're drunk.

626
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,478
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.

627
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,392
My wife is scared of you.

628
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,708
Of what?

629
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,909
I don't even know
if that's a joke or not.

630
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,076
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.

631
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,912
You know that's not
how it happened.

632
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,355
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

633
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,952
Were you just
at Scott Hipwell's house?

634
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,776
Why are you
at Scott Hipwell's house?

635
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Because I'm helping...

636
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,438
I'm helping him.

637
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,635
- How?
- To try and find Megan.

638
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,915
You don't even know Megan!

639
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,350
Rach,

640
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,034
I don't think
you're helping anybody.

641
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,709
So you're here because you
want to uncover lost memories?

642
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,354
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

643
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,475
Pardon?

644
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,155
No. Sorry. I, um, wasn't
expecting you to have an accent.

645
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,355
Well, you have an accent.

646
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Where are you from?

647
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,191
I'm American citizen.

648
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,555
But I guess you're not
here to talk about me.

649
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,952
- Unless you are.
- No. No.

650
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,077
Sorry, I was just, uh,
trying to make conversation.

651
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,513
The blackouts.

652
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,430
You're experiencing
blackouts?

653
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Mmm-hmm.

654
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,319
Do you wanna
tell me about them?

655
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Mmm...

656
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,554
Well, when I wake up, and when
someone tells me what I've done,

657
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,633
it just doesn't feel like me,
or like something that I would do.

658
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,188
I feel bad about it,
but, um...

659
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,036
But it's like it's so far
removed that I have a...

660
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,310
I just don't feel
bad enough.

661
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,153
You wanna take personal
responsibility for what you've done,

662
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,396
but you find it difficult
to feel accountable

663
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,436
because you can't
even remember it.

664
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,875
Yeah?

665
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,155
Yeah.

666
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,549
So, Rachel,
besides drinking...

667
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,797
Because you clearly drink.

668
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,030
You've been drinking today,
haven't you?

669
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,071
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

670
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,833
I like to draw.

671
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,831
Art, I guess.

672
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,916
Good. We can try to regain some
of your memories by drawing them.

673
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,911
I've tried it.
It doesn't work.

674
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,831
And have you ever
tracked all the way back

675
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,433
to when you started
drinking heavily?

676
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,313
When was that?

677
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,356
It was with Tom.

678
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,908
When I couldn't
get pregnant.

679
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,070
Who's Tom?

680
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,912
He's my ex-husband.

681
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,876
You wanna talk about that?

682
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,110
I really wanted a baby.

683
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,957
We tried everything
and nothing worked.

684
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,790
And it just absolutely...

685
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,631
It just broke my heart and...

686
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,390
So I got really sad.

687
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,072
And then, um...

688
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,234
And then the booze
just broke us.

689
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,118
Good. Tell me more.

690
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,988
I used to watch
this perfect couple.

691
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,513
And they were just
the embodiment of true love.

692
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,316
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

693
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,875
And then she betrayed him.

694
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,435
And it sparked
something in me.

695
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,554
Why are you
really here, Rachel?

696
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,717
Because I'm afraid
of myself.

697
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,629
July 5th.

698
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,157
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.

699
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,719
She calls again, 1:38.

700
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,430
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.

701
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,556
And July 6th.
You get the point.

702
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,596
She sometimes texts him
dozens of times a day.

703
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,836
But these are all
from an unknown number.

704
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,751
Unknown is Rachel.

705
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,478
You have a log of the calls.

706
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,275
You don't have a log of what
they're saying to each other.

707
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,316
Look, um...

708
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,016
Has she been back to the house since
the incident with your child?

709
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,553
Not that I know of.

710
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,816
Then, you may have a case for
harassment in the second degree.

711
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,035
But these are texts,
they're not threats. So...

712
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,353
She has been hanging around
Scott Hipwell's house.

713
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
A lot.

714
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,673
Yeah. I'm aware.

715
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,361
There are a lot of loose ends
here that suggest something,

716
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,237
but they don't add up
to much.

717
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,276
If you could bring me
something more solid...

718
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,271
What more do you need?

719
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,588
Evidence.

720
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,319
Real evidence.

721
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,393
You sure your husband doesn't wanna
stay in touch with his ex-wife?

722
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,318
What? No.
She's harassing us.

723
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,839
Is that what he calls it?

724
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,069
Hi.

725
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,031
- Hey.
- Hey.

726
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,479
Hi.

727
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,119
Reporters are in my yard.

728
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,517
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.

729
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,874
Come in.

730
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,471
The detective just...

731
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,159
The detective just
told me something

732
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,515
I've wanted to
hear for a long time.

733
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,032
She's pregnant.

734
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,870
She told her shrink
but not me.

735
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,912
I wanted a family.

736
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,352
But she fought me
every step of the way.

737
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,191
We always fought about it.

738
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,110
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

739
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,873
She loved you.

740
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,314
She loved you in ways that people
only dream of being loved.

741
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,439
You shouldn't be here.

742
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,119
I just...

743
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,390
I need to tell someone.

744
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,752
Just once.

745
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,990
Just say it out loud.

746
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,994
I wanna tell you.

747
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,437
And then I'll be gone.
I swear.

748
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,591
I got pregnant.

749
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,118
I was 17.

750
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,110
I had her by myself.

751
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,833
She had dark eyes
and blonde hair.

752
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,393
I expected it to be hard,
but it wasn't.

753
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,031
It was easy.

754
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,631
Because I loved her.

755
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,837
I loved her.

756
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,875
We called her Elizabeth.

757
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,279
Libby.

758
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,709
Libby.

759
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,717
It was December,

760
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,038
and we had gotten
in a fight, me and Mac.

761
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,196
He'd gone off and left.

762
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,516
The roof was leaking.

763
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,030
It was freezing cold, so

764
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,197
I got in the tub.

765
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,029
I brought Libby in with me,
put her on my chest.

766
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,595
Her head just under my chin.

767
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,796
I fell asleep.

768
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,872
I let her go.

769
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,676
I let her go.

770
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,151
I let her go.

771
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,597
I let her go.

772
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,959
I couldn't look.

773
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,989
I didn't wanna see it.

774
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,751
I didn't wanna
see her like that.

775
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,960
I wrapped her in a blanket
and I buried her.

776
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,989
Mac went out that night.

777
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,756
And he never came back.

778
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,710
He never came back.

779
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,432
I missed our home.

780
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,675
So one day,
when I was drunk,

781
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,391
I decided to go there.

782
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,872
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.

783
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,080
And then I heard Evie.

784
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,394
Who's Evie?

785
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,678
Tom's baby.

786
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,316
I know this sounds insane.

787
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,440
But I just wanted
to hold her.

788
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,797
Just for a moment.

789
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,680
Rachel!

790
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,516
What are you doing?

791
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,480
Rachel.

792
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,794
Give her to me.

793
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
Shh.

794
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,709
Mommy's here. Shh.

795
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
Shh.

796
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,478
I wasn't going to hurt her.

797
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,551
I would never hurt her.

798
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,037
I just wanted to hold her.

799
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,309
"Partially decomposed

01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,396
getting dressed
before going back to her.

812
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,870
Back to this house.

813
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,359
I actually miss
being the other woman.

814
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,918
Did you enjoy
cheating on Rachel?

815
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,319
Seriously?

816
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,871
Can we not fixate on her?

817
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,351
I saw her again today.

818
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,154
Where?

819
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,834
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

820
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,960
She was across the street.

821
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,914
And when she saw me,
she got aggressive.

822
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,911
Aggressive how?

823
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,195
What if Rachel killed Megan?

824
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,477
Rachel did not kill Megan.

825
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,676
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

826
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,520
- She's dangerous and you know it.
- Anna. Anna.

827
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,073
Sweetheart.

828
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,799
Rachel is a sad person.

829
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,155
She's completely harmless.

830
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,990
What are you doing here?

831
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,911
How did you get in?

832
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,350
Come here.
Have a beer with me.

833
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,950
I'm not drinking right now.

834
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,233
Detective Riley came
to see me last night.

835
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,439
And turns out,
I'm not the father.

836
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,949
Neither is the shrink.

837
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,632
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

838
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,514
Sit down.

839
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,158
Sit down!

840
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,116
Look, I don't know.
I don't know what this is about.

841
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,394
Oh, come on.

842
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,994
You and Megan were
such good friends.

843
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,437
You must have known.

844
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,152
Admit it.

845
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,833
Admit what?

846
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,992
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

847
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,112
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

848
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,070
She used other words, too.

849
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,548
Alcoholic.
Maybe even mentally unstable.

850
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,837
I am sorry. I was honestly
just trying to help you.

851
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,518
You're Tom's crazy ex.

852
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,113
When the fuck were
you gonna tell me that, huh?

853
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,400
And now the detective
is asking

854
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,510
if you and I are
in a relationship?

855
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,268
You?

856
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,875
I would never even get near
someone like you!

857
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,033
My wife is dead
and you're lying to me!

858
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,958
What's wrong with you?

859
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,040
Who does this?

860
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,036
I needed to tell you
about Megan's affair,

861
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,634
and you wouldn't have believed
me if I was just Tom's ex!

862
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,188
Oh, well, thank you
for getting Abdic

863
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,872
to point the finger at me.

864
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,191
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

865
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,558
How are they going, huh?

866
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,268
You know, the sessions.

867
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,835
With the doctor.

868
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,518
I wanted to know about Abdic
and I went to him to help you.

869
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,833
You're just a sad liar
with no life.

870
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,273
You're all liars.

871
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,395
Please!

872
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,079
God.

873
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,639
I need to
file a statement.

874
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,720
Name?

875
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
Rachel Watson.

876
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,871
Pete, I got this.

877
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,430
You wanted to
file a statement?

878
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,919
I'm listening.

879
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,674
Scott Hipwell
just assaulted me.

880
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,400
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott Hipwell?

881
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,714
No. We were just friends.

882
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,552
But that's what
you wanted, isn't it?

883
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,800
I mean you got him to stay overnight
at your apartment, right?

884
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,910
No, you... you need the context.

885
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,319
I know the context.

886
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,719
But what I'm trying
to determine

887
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,995
is when your obsession
with Mr. Hipwell began.

888
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,516
Was it before or after his
pregnant wife was murdered?

889
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,716
I mean you were neighbors
at one point.

890
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,153
I met him after.

891
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,753
After being
questioned by me,

892
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,877
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself.

893
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,394
And then you manage to get
him to incriminate himself,

894
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,516
all the while
hoping he'll fuck you.

895
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,591
I came here
trying to help you.

896
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,393
He just assaulted me
in my own house!

897
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,112
You were seen
in the area that night.

898
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,034
There are several hours that
you say you can't account for.

899
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,680
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.

900
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,039
No, he didn't.

901
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,551
Surveillance footage
from a sports bar

902
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,837
accounts for Mr. Hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

903
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,153
You're lying.

904
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,438
You're lying.

905
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,392
Tell me what happened.

906
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,399
It's okay.

907
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,358
Tell me.

908
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,197
I don't know.

909
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,952
Did you murder
Megan Hipwell?

910
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,829
Hi.

911
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,997
I need to see you.

912
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,391
Can you please come over?

913
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:09,154
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.

914
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,429
I can feel how cold she was.

915
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,312
Forgive yourself.

916
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,156
You don't have to be
afraid of being alone.

917
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,476
You're not alone.

918
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,869
You'll be fine.

919
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,916
You and your baby
will be fine.

920
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,595
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?

921
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,356
I could ask you
the same question.

922
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,476
I saw you...

923
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,916
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...

924
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,270
All right. I know
I saw you there.

925
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,954
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.

926
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,309
But what did you see?

927
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,190
What happened that night?
What did you see?

928
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,032
All right. You, uh...

929
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,554
You busted your ass.
You fell.

930
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,359
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

931
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,510
You told me to fuck off,
so I fucked off.

932
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,832
Was I with anyone?
Was I... was I alone? What happened?

933
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,831
I don't know.

934
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,753
You were wasted.
You're always wasted.

935
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,116
That's all I can tell you.

936
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,469
Whoa. Take it easy.

937
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,553
I need you to tell me
the fucking truth.

938
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,469
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?

939
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,033
I don't know.

940
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,470
I'm assuming
it's the worst.

941
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,593
God.

942
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,070
Come here for one second.
Just one second.

943
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,593
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."

944
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,035
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

945
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,588
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked Tom on the...

946
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,430
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else,

947
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,080
betraying her husband, I felt

948
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,754
pure rage.

949
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,559
If I could,
I'd go to her house,

950
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,960
I'd find her
sitting there and...

951
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,917
Smash her head
all over the floor!

952
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,869
Cathy, thank you
for all you have done for me.

953
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,518
I'm sorry to leave this way.

954
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,477
I'll send
for my things later.

955
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,675
Love, Rachel.

956
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,557
That is so true!

957
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,476
It's the worst
restaurant ever.

958
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,152
Why do we keep going back?

959
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,268
Martha?

960
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,475
Martha.

961
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,193
Rachel?

962
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,278
I haven't seen you
in a million years.

963
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,794
Yeah, I wanted to call you.

964
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,354
Um, but Tom said I should
just leave it alone.

965
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,874
Oh.
Um...

966
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,033
I'm so sorry.

967
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,354
For what?

968
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,431
For the barbecue,

969
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,873
and I just need you to know
that I don't remember anything,

970
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,632
and, um, I just
completely blacked out.

971
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,840
Everyone had a little too
much to drink, so it's okay.

972
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,714
I know, but with the eggs,
and then I screamed at you.

973
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,315
That I was that abusive,
I just feel...

974
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,073
I just feel so
ashamed about it.

975
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,633
Um...

976
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,869
I don't...

977
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:20,679
Tom said that I smashed
your plate. I don't...

978
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,070
Tom was fired
because of how I behaved.

979
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,358
You felt sick and you took a
nap in our guest bedroom.

980
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,600
Do you wanna lie down?

981
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,478
Come with me.
Okay.

982
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,353
Excuse us.

983
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,112
Rachel,
are you feeling better?

984
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,312
You guys can stay
the night if you want.

985
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,594
No. That's fine.

986
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
Thanks.
Okay.

987
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,194
I think I'd remember
if you caused a scene.

988
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,479
I'm so sorry.

989
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,629
Get up.

990
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,391
And then Tom took you home.

991
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,072
I'm sorry, Tom.

992
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,355
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!

993
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,440
Sorry.

994
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,256
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.

995
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,400
Can't even fucking stand up!

996
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,431
What is wrong with you?
Can you stand?

997
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,352
Fucking disgusting.

998
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,078
No. No.

999
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,039
Yeah. Tom got fired because he
couldn't keep his dick in his pants.

1000
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,078
You did nothing wrong.
Nothing.

1001
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,951
Wake the fuck up,
Rachel! Wake the fuck up!

1002
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,675
Wake up!

1003
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,712
You can sleep
out here.

1004
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,400
We all
felt so bad for you.

1005
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,311
He's such a bad guy.

1006
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,399
Ugh, God.

1007
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,833
Are you okay?

1008
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Hmm.

1009
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,949
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3:00.

1010
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,832
I'm here. Where are you?

1011
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,639
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.

1012
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,231
What are you doing up?

1013
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,631
Picking up after Evie.

1014
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,228
You whore!

1015
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,160
Leave us alone.

1016
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,957
No new messages.

1017
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,031
No saved messages.

01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,679
You okay?

1023
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,436
I thought I heard something.

1024
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,670
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

1025
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,994
I just...

1026
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,678
Come back to bed.

1027
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,719
Whore!

1028
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,112
Rachel's down there.

1029
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,189
What the hell
are you doing?

1030
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,519
Come here.

1031
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,359
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!

1032
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,256
You're okay.
You just need some help.

1033
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,475
Don't touch me.
You just need to get a little help up.

1034
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,879
Just fuck off. Fuck off!

1035
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,160
Oh.

1036
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,235
Anna?

1037
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,592
- No. Go away!
- Anna, please. Please.

1038
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,715
There's... Okay.
Go!

1039
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,030
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.

1040
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,314
I just need to talk to you.

1041
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,152
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1042
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,559
Where's Tom?

1043
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,435
He's lying to you.

1044
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,279
He always does.
He's a good liar.

1045
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,635
I know he's a good liar.

1046
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,029
We went behind
your back for months.

1047
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,753
He's just done it to you.

1048
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,273
I know he's cheating.

1049
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,188
I know.

1050
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,033
- Anna, he killed Megan.
- No, we don't...

1051
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,394
We don't know that.

1052
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,311
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

1053
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,994
- Anna, you need to leave.
- No.

1054
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:24,079
- You need to leave. 
- No.

1055
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,036
- You need to take Evie and you need to leave. 
- No.

1056
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,315
- Get out of here. It's not safe.
- I'm not leaving him.

1057
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,153
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

1058
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,870
It's not about the affair
and you know that deep down.

1059
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,656
- Anna, please, just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

1060
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,671
Please come with me.

1061
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,558
- Anna, don't.
- Come in the house, honey.

1062
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,789
Please.

1063
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,513
I saw you, Tom.
You motherfucker!

1064
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,036
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!

1065
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,357
You killed her!
You fucking killed her! I know it!

1066
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,592
Un-fucking-believable!

1067
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,797
Listen to me.
Megan got into his car that night.

1068
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,474
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out. I saw you.

1069
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,073
Why did Megan
get in your car?

1070
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,832
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

1071
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,353
Yes, she did!

1072
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,959
Tell her the truth.

1073
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,296
Just tell her
the truth right now.

1074
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,039
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you!

1075
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,394
I found Megan's phone.

1076
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,557
I found it.

1077
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,313
So all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

1078
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,830
So were you fucking her
while she was here working?

1079
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,798
While she was
looking after our daughter?

1080
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,069
Yeah.

1081
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,118
You were so tired
all the time and...

1082
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,271
It's all about Evie.

1083
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,432
That's right.

1084
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,034
It was all about you,
wasn't it?

1085
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,794
Tom, give her to me.

1086
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,279
It's all right.

1087
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,556
It was all about you,
wasn't it?

1088
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,995
Tom, give her to me. Please.

1089
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,718
- Please give her to me.
- She's fine.

1090
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,536
I think she needs changing, please?
She's gonna be fine.

1091
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,039
Please just give her to me.

1092
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,389
Shh.

1093
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,376
- Let her go. You're gonna hurt her.
- Change her here.

1094
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,640
Okay. I'll change her. Let her go.
You're gonna hurt her.

1095
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:35,755
Shh.

1096
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,960
911, what's your...

1097
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,634
What's your emergency?

1098
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,075
No. Stay.

1099
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,469
Stay.

1100
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,234
Do you need a drink?

1101
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,349
No.

1102
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,119
Yeah, you do.

1103
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,437
All those things
that you said I did...

1104
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,917
Those terrible things,
I didn't do any of them.

1105
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,198
You just watched me suffer.

1106
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,475
You made me
feel so worthless.

1107
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,472
You made me think
that everything was my fault.

1108
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,194
Drink it.

1109
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,310
You told me
I got you fired.

1110
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,838
But I didn't.

1111
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,879
You know,
I saw Martha on the train.

1112
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,995
Drink it!

1113
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,509
I saw Martha on the train,

1114
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,114
and she told me
that you were fired

1115
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,351
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

1116
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,428
Shh.

1117
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,751
Rachel's down there.

1118
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,193
Wait here.

1119
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,317
Gonna get in the car?

1120
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,033
What's going on?

1121
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,919
Don't worry about it.

1122
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,913
Come on.

1123
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,439
Okay, I'm here.

1124
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,318
So what is it?

1125
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,955
I just wanna
go to the woods.

1126
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,995
What is it with
you crazy women?

1127
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,517
Is that what you want?

1128
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:11,680
No.

1129
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,280
Oh.

1130
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,233
Like this?

1131
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,075
What?

1132
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,593
I'm pregnant.

1133
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,319
Congratulations.

1134
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,956
I thought you should know.

1135
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,196
You thought
I should know?

1136
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,516
There's a chance
it could be yours.

1137
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,397
Then get an abortion.

1138
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,754
Or if it's Scott's,
do whatever you want,

1139
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,198
but if it's not,
then get rid of it.

1140
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:01,157
You can be as
involved as you want.

1141
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,309
You're a shitty nanny.

1142
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,039
What makes you think you're
gonna be a good mother?

1143
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,750
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

1144
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,434
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

1145
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,997
I played your game so you could fuck
me in between Evie's playdates.

1146
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,356
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

1147
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,715
I took care of your kid
to be near you!

1148
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,353
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

1149
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,476
and you fucked me
'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.

1150
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,758
Take us all away and you're
just a pathetic, impotent man.

1151
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,152
You're not
gonna get rid of me.

1152
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,033
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

1153
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,952
You're like a dog.

1154
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,878
Like one of
those unwanted,

1155
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,837
mistreated dogs.

1156
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,952
And if you kick them,

1157
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,269
they keep coming back to you.

1158
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,749
Thinking that
somehow if they're good...

1159
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,956
You're not doing this again.

1160
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,758
...you'll love them.

1161
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,991
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.

1162
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,235
You brought this
on yourself, Rachel.

1163
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,397
If you'd just stayed away
that one night...

1164
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:53,232
Just left us all alone...

1165
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,116
You brought this on Megan.

1166
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,434
In a way, you killed her.

1167
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,392
But I didn't.

1168
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,118
You did.

1169
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,355
No!

1170
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,314
And you did this
to me in our marriage.

1171
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,833
You made me fucking crazy.

1172
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,879
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be married to a fucking blur?

1173
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,596
I had no choice.
He was...

1174
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,716
He would have killed me.

1175
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,199
I never wanted to hurt him.

1176
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,437
It was self-defense.

1177
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,992
She had no choice.

1178
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,156
Tom would have killed her.

1179
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,991
I saw the whole thing.

1180
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,595
Rachel was right
about Megan.

1181
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,075
She was right
about everything.

1182
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,474
We're tied forever now,
the three of us.

1183
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,400
Bound forever
by the story we share.

1184
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:47,436
Today, I sit in a different
car and I look ahead.

1185
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:53,797
Anything is possible, because I
am not the girl I used to be.
