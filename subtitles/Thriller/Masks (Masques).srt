1
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,176
APPLAUSE

2
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,278
Gustave, that went quite well.

3
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,451
- I'm overwhelmed.
- Of course.

4
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,583
That old song brings back
so many memories.

5
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,854
But you were wonderful.
Thank you.

6
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,434
And now, Number 8.

7
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,864
And isn't she pretty?
Now, what's your name?

8
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,167
Emilie.

9
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,807
Show our friends how pretty you are.

10
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,204
She's so moved,
even a bit scared.

11
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,317
But don't be.
Our friends are so kind.

12
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,651
<i>Now, what have you chosen?</i>

13
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,024
<i>- “White Hands''.
- A pretty song.</i>

14
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,962
<i>A shame it's been forgotten.</i>

15
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,125
<i>Move up to the microphone.
A wonderful choice.</i>

16
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,205
<i>I leave you now with Emilie
and her “White Hands."</i>

17
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,570
Colette.

18
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,651
I'm awful there,
with that charming Emilie.

19
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,616
It's like I wanted
to look down at my watch.

20
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,382
I don't think so, sir.

21
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,392
It was a very sweet
and charming moment.

22
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,020
In fact, I think l did want
to look at my watch.

23
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,558
That would surprise me.
Mr. Wolf has arrived.

24
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,838
Mr. Wolf? Let him in, then.

25
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,238
This way, please.
Mr. Legagneur will see you now.

26
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,650
- Roland Wolf.
- Christian Legagneur.

27
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,850
Colette, Mr. Wolf is doing me
the honor of writing my biography.

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,659
On the contrary, sir.
You're giving me the pleasure.

29
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,161
Call me Christian
or we won't get anywhere.

30
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,926
He also writes detective novels.

31
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,693
Under what name, was it?

32
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,771
Well, Roland Wolf.

33
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,674
Of course. It all gets so confused
in my poor head.

34
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,106
I guess you won't be back
this week?

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,340
You bet.
My head's about to explode.

36
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,178
- And Wednesdays show?
- I'm sure you'll manage.

37
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,048
And if I need to contact you?

38
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,689
Call Colette at the number
I gave you.

39
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,683
Well, then, try to relax.

40
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,622
And you, try to work hard.

41
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,619
Tell me...

42
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,426
I was thinking.

43
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,063
I'm sure you were.

44
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,041
For your book,
the sooner, the better.

45
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,268
Definitely.

46
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,811
How long do you need
to operate on me?

47
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,109
Twenty hours, I'm afraid.

48
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,876
Here's what I propose:

49
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,146
The show is off this week
due to the soccer championship.

50
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,313
I'll take you to my house
in the country.

51
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,484
We'll be in paradise.
No phone calls, no pests.

52
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,323
Do you like the country?

53
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,660
I prefer traveling,
but the country's okay.

54
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,892
You can bring along
your girlfriend.

55
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,233
- I don't have one at the moment.
- What more could the people want?

56
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,064
How about a drink then?

57
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,043
I must say, I'd hoped
for something like this.

58
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,341
I thought so.

59
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,780
You could've put your bag
in the trunk.

60
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,851
I thought it was full.

61
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,386
Is that true, Max?

62
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,927
By the way, Max is mute.

63
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,366
A serious illness.

64
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,371
A sort of tongue cancer
with metastases in the ear.

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,500
But they stopped it in time,
right, Max?

66
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,328
Here we are. And welcome.

67
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,430
Max, show Mr. Wolf to his room.

68
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,100
See you in a few minutes.

69
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,006
What is all this crap?

70
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,476
I tell you, getting
the Clos Vougeot was no picnic.

71
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,482
Madeleine.

72
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,981
My dear Roland,
take a seat there, next to Patricia.

73
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,980
- Roland Wolf.
- Patricia Marquet.

74
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,052
Watch out.
She's got a strong grip.

75
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,715
She's a masseuse, and a good one.

76
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,858
An in-house masseuse.
What a luxury.

77
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,894
- Good to have someone new beside me.
- She reads cards as well.

78
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,829
- Only for those I'm fond of.
- You've never read them for me.

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,594
Cut the nonsense
and pour us some wine.

80
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,431
My husband, Manuel Marquet.

81
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,598
Yes, Manu. Pour us some wine.
He's an expert in the red stuff.

82
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,608
I ordered Clos Vougeot and Moults.
Do you want some Savigny too?

83
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,250
You know you have carte blanche here.

84
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,552
- You're in charge of the cellar?
- Christian was kind enough -

85
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,021
I'm not kind.
I just rely on experts.

86
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,444
- Good.
- Good?

87
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,816
Very good.

88
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,154
Full-bodied, rich color,
lingering taste.

89
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,057
Keep it under control.

90
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,725
I must say it's excellent.

91
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,895
It's quite good.

92
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,971
Terrine of pheasant.
I hope you like game.

93
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,005
- The season's open?
- One of Max's little secrets.

94
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,080
Best not to dig any deeper.

95
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,480
How do you like his chef's hat?
Isn't he handsome?

96
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,449
He loves wearing many hats.
Right, Max?

97
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,815
And Colette,
the best secretary I've ever had,

98
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,427
puts on her little apron
and serves at the table.

99
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,791
You seem surprised,
my dear Wolf.

100
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,357
- It's quite unusual.
- Indeed.

101
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,025
That's why they do it -
for the fun of it.

102
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,330
- Right, Colette?
- Absolutely, sir.

103
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,465
It's very amusing
to live several lives at once.

104
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,170
Here you are, darling.

105
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,809
I'm late.

106
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,889
Catherine, my godchild.

107
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,359
Allow me to introduce Roland Wolf.

108
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,821
He's the one writing the book
I told you about.

109
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,890
Hello, miss.

110
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,195
Forgive me for being late, sir.

111
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,361
- Please don't mention it.
- Help yourself.

112
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,469
You eat like a bird.

113
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,039
Be a good girl.

114
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,473
There.

115
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,515
- I put in the tablets.
- Very good.

116
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,756
Drink it while you eat.

117
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,464
- Is the medicine unpleasant?
- It's all right.

118
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,831
No point in restraining
your curiosity, Mr. Wolf.

119
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,574
My goddaughter's been ill
for several months.

120
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,306
All because of a blasted quack

121
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,442
who came to cure her
of simple food poisoning

122
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,105
and gave her such
a bizarre prescription

123
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,242
that she was left paralyzed
for several days.

124
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,717
Not paralyzed.

125
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,347
You couldn't use your legs, pet.

126
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,183
But things are going better,

127
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,091
thanks to a gentle
yet effective treatment

128
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,425
that Patricia helped me to perfect.

129
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,600
Using only herbs.

130
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,096
Unfortunately,
her eyes are still sensitive.

131
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,097
You know what?

132
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,006
I'll close the drapes.

133
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,666
I think my goose is cooked.

134
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,901
You're very good.

135
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,968
You're good too,

136
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,176
but your goose is indeed cooked.

137
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,512
No one's as good as you.

138
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,348
Don't smother me with compliments.

139
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,452
And put down that knitting.

140
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,658
Don't worry.
I'm hardly even aware of it.

141
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,994
You look tired, little girl.

142
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,356
I'm sleepy as well.

143
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,225
We're all sleepy.

144
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,501
One thing:
There are no hangers in my room.

145
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,574
Max will straighten that out.

146
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,179
Oh, that idiot has gone to bed.

147
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,172
You look after it.
You know where the hangers are.

148
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,622
<i>I'll</i> bring the hangers
to your room, sir.

149
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,649
Are these enough?

150
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,419
Oh, yes. I'm very neat,
but I don't have many clothes.

151
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,951
Well, then, good night.

152
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,070
Why did you do that?

153
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,006
Because I love you.

154
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,305
I love your eyes.

155
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,242
Kiss me...

156
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,619
and look right at me.

157
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,869
Don't say anything to my godfather.

158
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,278
He trusts me so much.

159
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,381
He's so afraid for me.

160
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,675
He's so kind.

161
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,690
Ah, my friend!

162
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,663
You slept well?

163
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,335
- Quite well.
- Sit down.

164
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,134
You're an early riser.
I like that.

165
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,035
It depends on the day.

166
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,532
Are you a tea or coffee person?
I take tea.

167
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,304
Tea then.

168
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,480
Would you like eggs or something?

169
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,172
- No, I'll just have some toast.
- Help yourself.

170
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,086
What would you say
to a half hour of jogging?

171
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,819
Frankly, it's not my cup of tea.

172
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,122
We'll get along just fine.

173
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,627
But you're wrong.
It feels great.

174
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,891
You get rid of all the filth inside.

175
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,428
It's almost a metaphysical exercise.

176
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,670
Yeah?

177
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,238
I must say I find it quite boring.
I'm more of a tennis person.

178
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,033
You're a snob.
But I'll put you to the test.

179
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,076
Here's what I propose:

180
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,681
May I speak informally with you?
I can't work any other way.

181
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,752
We'll work for a couple hours.

182
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,756
Then Max will take me to Paris
for a business lunch.

183
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,052
I'll look after some things
for next week's show.

184
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,721
And when I get back,
we'll play a set or two.

185
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,358
- Two hours isn't very long.
- We'll work more tomorrow.

186
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,698
Come on, let's get a move on.

187
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,039
From the start:

188
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,379
My father was a pharmacist.
He died when I was 12.

189
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,712
My mother was unable to work.

190
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,779
She'd never given it a thought.

191
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,218
She looked after the estate
as best she could,

192
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,152
which was not very well.

193
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,822
It was depleted very quickly.

194
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,295
How unpleasant it is
to slowly become poor,

195
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,465
to sink quietly into poverty.

196
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:31,241
But in the end, I found that people
were generally quite kind.

197
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,205
That's surprising.
Normally, people say the opposite.

198
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,008
If you lack the strength to fight,
others can't do a thing for you.

199
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,377
Very enlightening.

200
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,815
I'm not an intellectual, you know.

201
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,657
With me,
it's all about emotion.

202
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,989
I chose this career-
or it chose me, I don't know -

203
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,497
because I like people,
no matter who they are.

204
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,302
When they come on stage

205
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,964
with their timid looks,

206
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,711
their little bouquets,
their thin voices...

207
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,143
it wells up in me.

208
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,281
I almost feel like crying.

209
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,815
Sounds silly, right?

210
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,455
You'll write some nice line
about the strong protecting the weak.

211
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,061
I think I can manage that.

212
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,537
What's wrong, Frangois?

213
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,811
The poor old girl.

214
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,014
She was wearing a sort of
violet perfume. It was horrible.

215
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,922
It reeked like an Outhouse.

216
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,689
You're quite the actor, aren't you?

217
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,126
Why?

218
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,963
She was charming.

219
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,362
The fact is, I have allergies.

220
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,807
And not just to violets,
but to dust, mosquitoes, feathers.

221
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,374
Feathers are the worst.

222
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,773
Aren't allergies rather psychosomatic?

223
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,881
That's what they say.
But they also say the opposite.

224
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,915
Be careful about
the mosquitoes here.

225
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,683
Did you get bitten last night?

226
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,578
Last night? No.

227
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,122
Because mosquitoes are dreadful.

228
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,758
Mosquitoes come from
the same era as the diplodocus.

229
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,363
The diplodocus disappeared,

230
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,363
but the mosquito survived.

231
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,060
- A beautiful metaphor.
- I love metaphors.

232
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,965
They're the most subtle and powerful way
of expressing complex ideas.

233
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,536
That is, if you can decipher them -
if they are decipherable.

234
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,271
That's the problem.

235
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,350
Otherwise, they're just images, which is already not half bad.

236
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,549
You're here, darling.
We didn't hear you.

237
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,789
You crept in like a little mouse.

238
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,957
- A little mosquito.
- I didn't mean to intrude.

239
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,057
Did you sleep well?

240
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,325
I've been up for a while.

241
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,594
What's this?

242
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,796
I made it.

243
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,503
It's baked clay.

244
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,946
Baked? Where?

245
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,015
In the kitchen.

246
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,544
In the oven.

247
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,951
You could've burned yourself.

248
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,488
You need a special oven
that has safety devices.

249
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,999
That's crazy.
You worked so hard on it.

250
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,762
So what? You weren't happy with it.

251
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,269
But I was, Catherine.

252
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,168
The poor child.

253
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,839
I do everything I can
to help her recover.

254
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,878
She gets better for a few days,
then without warning she has a relapse.

255
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,623
I think it was just nerves.

256
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,021
She has no reason to be nervous!

257
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,218
I treat her like a daughter.

258
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,390
Her parents died when she was five

259
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,167
in a tragic car accident.

260
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,827
We can't even glue it back together.

261
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,002
They were my best friends.
They were killed instantly.

262
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,634
Since she had no family,
and I was her godfather,

263
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,303
I took her in.

264
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,177
Then I grew fond of her.

265
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,213
The love of children, you know.

266
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,517
It's crazy.

267
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,658
It eats you alive.

268
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,090
They're the real ogres.

269
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,197
Could you ring for Colette?
It's near the chimney.

270
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,363
Thanks.

271
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,377
She's like a daughter to me,
and she worries me.

272
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,912
I don't really know what to do.

273
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,276
- Why don't you call a doctor?
- No.

274
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,744
They're the ones
who put her in this state.

275
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,558
Colette, could you take this away?

276
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,459
Catherine made it
and then smashed it.

277
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,757
The poor girl.
I saw her run crying to her room.

278
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,697
Look after her.
Try to console her.

279
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,671
I have to go now.
Where's Max?

280
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,335
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Don't get too bored without me.

281
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,242
- I'll be transcribing.
- And when I get back-

282
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,609
Madeleine.

283
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,594
Rummaging, are we?

284
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,698
Mr. Legagneur challenged me
to a match.

285
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,901
If you accepted, you're crazy.
He'll beat you.

286
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,296
I play well, you know.

287
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,904
At least, not bad.

288
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:48,042
He beats everybody at every game.
He's a monster.

289
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,709
He didn't beat Madeleine, did he?

290
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,107
You know Madeleine?

291
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,317
Not at all.
He spoke of her to me.

292
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,589
She was a true champion.

293
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,249
But he must have beat her
a couple of times.

294
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,953
And what happened
to little Madeleine?

295
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,489
She left one day,just like that,
without fanfare.

296
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,360
She went to the Seychelles.

297
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,067
She left a note for Christian.
I think he was quite hurt.

298
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,670
But he's so kind,
he made excuses for her.

299
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,240
When'll you do my cards?

300
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,643
Whenever you want.

301
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,356
But I'd rather do
other things for you.

302
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,488
Come now, Patricia.

303
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,225
What are you thinking?
I'm a masseuse, before all else.

304
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,789
Here, my dear Wolf.

305
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,100
I bet you can't guess
the origin of this wine.

306
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,134
I wouldn't even dare.

307
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,415
There's just a little salad after this.
Will that be enough?

308
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,612
Certainly.

309
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,018
Light lunches are healthier.

310
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,981
That's debatable.

311
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,787
Look at you.
As fat as a monk.

312
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:11,992
Shall I serve you?

313
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,653
Please do.

314
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,199
And the wine, Mr. Wolf?

315
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,796
Excellent. But I couldn't tell you
where it's from.

316
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,865
Of course not.
It's from Australia.

317
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,705
Catherine isn't eating?

318
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,807
No, she's in her room.

319
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,980
Her godfather wants her to rest.

320
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,918
I'll bring her something later.

321
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,889
Mr. Wolf found Madeleine's racquet.

322
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,886
Little Madeleine.

323
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,730
Madeleine's racquet?

324
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,727
Do you know Madeleine?

325
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,728
Not at all. Who's she?

326
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,571
A young girl.
A friend of Catherine's.

327
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,210
Mr. Legagneur invited her here
for his godchild.

328
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,447
She wanted to be an actress.

329
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,217
She left one night
without a word.

330
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,046
She was a bit ﬂighty.

331
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,649
Didn't she have family?

332
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,790
I don't know.

333
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,521
You should ask Mr. Legagneur.

334
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,687
Some salad?

335
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,388
Please.

336
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,568
May I take over Mr. Legagneur's office
this afternoon?

337
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,068
Of course.
That's what we had in mind.

338
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,902
<i>A little silly, right?</i>

339
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,540
<i>You'll write some nice line
about the strong protecting the weak.</i>

340
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,380
<i>I think I can manage that.</i>

341
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,285
<i>You like to play the cynic.
Young people like to be cynical.</i>

342
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,652
<i>But be careful:</i>

343
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:57,268
<i>In an interview like this, I can learn
as much about you as you do about me.</i>

344
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,394
- <i>Maybe. But I've got nothing to hide.</i>
- <i>Me neither.</i>

345
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,270
<i>And that's what
makes up my strength:</i>

346
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,839
<i>my sentiments, my emotions,
my naiveté even.</i>

347
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,809
<i>I accept all that.</i>

348
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,576
<i>I'm not ﬂattering myself
I'm just happy to be that way.</i>

349
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,609
<i>You're a happy man?</i>

350
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,577
<i>I feel good.</i>

351
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,888
<i>I feel well-balanced.</i>

352
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,626
<i>I'd like everyone around me
to feel the same.</i>

353
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,097
<i>You should jog, Roland.</i>

354
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,635
<i>You'd breathe deeply,
rid yourself of the filth inside.</i>

355
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,099
<i>You know St. Paul's epistles
to Timothy?</i>

356
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,500
<i>Hardly at all.</i>

357
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,711
<i>Actually,
I'm not the church-going type.</i>

358
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,015
<i>Catechism was a nightmare for me.</i>

359
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,620
<i>Even as kids,
we thought it was a bore.</i>

360
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,217
<i>But St. Paul is something else.</i>

361
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,154
<i>He's completely modern.</i>

362
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,525
<i>What he says about
understanding truth, for instance,</i>

363
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,097
<i>is extraordinary.</i>

364
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,532
<i>What I want you to understand,
because it's the key to everything...</i>

365
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,398
COLLECTOR'S EDITION
PLEASE DO NOT CUT PAGES

366
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,132
<i>is that I love my work passionately.</i>

367
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,839
<i>Don't worry I'm not saying
it'; a religion to me.</i>

368
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,875
<i>But frankly, ifs almost that.</i>

369
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,919
<i>I feel so strong.</i>

370
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,053
St. Paul to Timothy.

371
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,524
“Let the woman remain in silence“ -

372
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,427
<i>And they seem so weak to me.</i>

373
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,425
<i>I've taped all my shows.</i>

374
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,559
<i>I'll play one for you,
so you'll understand.</i>

375
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,874
So, did you get some work done?

376
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,450
Yeah, a little.
I worked in your office.

377
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,109
Good move.

378
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,280
It's a comfortable room.
I like it a lot.

379
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,025
Are things starting to take shape?

380
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,024
Yes, things are taking shape.

381
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,126
Excuse me,
but may I have a word with you?

382
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,891
Go ahead, my dear friend.

383
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,433
It's confidential.

384
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,236
Well, then,
let's speak in confidence.

385
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,409
You did well.

386
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,812
Let her sleep.
I'll take care of it tonight.

387
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,855
And our match?
No backing out now.

388
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,656
- Damn it!
-30-40.

389
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,655
I'm going to lose.

390
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,065
But the match isn't even.
I was a real pig at lunch.

391
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,171
I think you're letting me win.

392
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,306
You guessed right.

393
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,410
You owe me another set.

394
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,244
I owe you nothing, but I accept.

395
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,112
I'm worn out.

396
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,692
You must be ranked,
you cagey devil.

397
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,259
You're not so bad yourself.

398
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,524
Oh, come on, I was terrible.

399
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,359
I was using Madeleine's racquet.

400
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,264
Madeleine?

401
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,402
“M.C."

402
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,843
Ah, right.
That's Madeleine's racquet.

403
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,882
I thought she took it with her.

404
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,347
- Who told you about her?
- Patricia.

405
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,951
We came here before lunch.

406
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,116
You're fooling around with her?
Be careful.

407
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,494
- She's a man-eater.
- So it would seem.

408
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,026
And just who is this Madeleine?

409
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,198
One of those girls
who want to get into showbiz.

410
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,033
She followed me around for a month

411
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,470
like a regular groupie.

412
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,910
I thought she'd make
a good friend for Catherine.

413
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,505
She was quite charming.
Pretty, even.

414
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,987
I invited her here for Easter,
and she ended up staying three months.

415
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,181
Shall we go in?

416
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,418
- Did she have no relatives?
- How should I know?

417
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,221
She never mentioned any.

418
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,587
And I never asked.

419
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,655
Why did she leave?

420
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,261
She left an odd note saying
she was going on a trip.

421
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,371
To the Seychelles, Patricia said.

422
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:33,274
My old-timers win trips there.
She must've dreamed about it, too.

423
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,844
- Catherine didn't say anything?
- She said nothing.

424
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,408
But why are you so interested?

425
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,518
I'm just intrigued
by young people's behavior.

426
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,744
Indeed.

427
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,746
- May I ask you how old you are?
- Twenty-seven.

428
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,915
I'm also intrigued
by young people's behavior.

429
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,723
Did you get him?

430
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,304
I can't stay long.

431
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,085
What did you do all day?

432
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,348
I slept.

433
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,457
Colette told me
he wanted me to sleep.

434
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,290
Were you tired?

435
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,268
I don't know.
My eyes and legs were sore.

436
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,836
I like you.

437
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,776
I wanted to see you,
but I was afraid I'd hurt him.

438
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,882
Fear the image of God.

439
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,452
It's a very common
and dangerous image.

440
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,190
I don't know what you mean.

441
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,862
Did you like Madeleine?

442
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,663
How do you know her?

443
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,170
I don't. I'm just asking.

444
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,500
I hated her.
She was mean and deceitful.

445
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,012
- She paid back good with evil.
- What do you mean?

446
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,015
I don't want to talk about her.
I was glad she left.

447
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,551
I have to go.

448
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,414
Another time.

449
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,104
May l?

450
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,529
Show me your knees.

451
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,921
Have you been
having problems walking?

452
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,650
It depends.
In the evening, sometimes.

453
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,127
Don't be so upset, my pet.

454
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,725
Colette will bring you your medicine.

455
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,958
Don't send me to the hospital.

456
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,626
Havel ever sent you there?

457
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,069
I know you like
that young man very much.

458
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,971
No, don't say a word.

459
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,974
I was young once myself.

460
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,843
I know that the feeling of love

461
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:35,451
is like a wave that's hard to stop.

462
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,516
But the problem is,
Wolf is just having his fun.

463
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,428
For him, women are just toys.

464
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,755
He takes up with one,

465
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,357
then another.

466
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,267
Toys are easily broken.

467
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,100
Especially by careless people.

468
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,477
Remember Madeleine.

469
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,115
You're not a toy.

470
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,216
I don't want you to get broken.

471
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,123
Is everything all right?

472
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,792
Just fine.

473
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,694
There now.

474
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,030
Sleep tight.

475
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,237
We'll look after you.

476
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,217
They mustn't see each other.

477
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,485
We can stop them during the day,
but at night?

478
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,185
Double her dose.

479
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,056
Why were those tires in my trunk?

480
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,395
It's scrap. Max is going to Aida
day after tomorrow.

481
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,259
Really bright.

482
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,705
You have to lay
your hands on the cards.

483
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,941
So, you've taken over my territory?

484
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,518
Are you going to be long?

485
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:19,386
I'd like Mr. Wolf and I
to work a bit.

486
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,355
- If you don't mind.
- Not at all.

487
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,428
- We'll continue later, Roland.
- Of course.

488
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,497
You call him by his first name now?

489
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,634
Mr. Wolf asked me to.

490
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,793
He knows how to talk to women,
this guy.

491
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,531
Roland, be kind and pass me a cigar.

492
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,105
There are none left.

493
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,939
Manu's work again, right, Patricia?

494
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,778
There must be some in my drawer.

495
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,615
Now you know
why I keep them locked up.

496
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,626
Will you give me a little massage?

497
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,061
- I'm sore.
- With pleasure.

498
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,261
No, the small gold one.

499
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,634
- Take one, if you want.
- No, thanks. Never in the morning.

500
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,584
I'll go get my recorder.

501
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,917
That feels good.

502
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,486
That's wonderful.

503
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,261
Thank you, dear.

504
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,807
That reminds me of my youth,
when I sang.

505
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,571
We had relaxation sessions
to clear our voices. Sit down.

506
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,072
There was an old Chinese masseur
with extraordinary hands.

507
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,582
- You sang?
- Years ago.

508
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:33,254
I don't have good memories of it.
But we must be honest, right?

509
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,085
Did you sleep well last night?

510
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,853
Not bad.
A few mosquitoes. And you?

511
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,156
I barricade myself in
with eyeshades and earplugs.

512
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,357
It takes a lot to wake me up.

513
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,502
Why did you stop singing?

514
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,530
Allergies.They're awful.

515
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,733
They destroy your voice
in two weeks. Horrible.

516
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,772
Just the thought of it
and I'm in a cold sweat. After 25 years.

517
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,179
Your singing career
was strangled, if you will.

518
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,185
- What a cruel way to put it.
- Sorry.

519
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,518
- I'd kill my sister for a well-turned phrase.
- How awful!

520
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,553
My dear Patricia,

521
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,990
be kind enough
to leave us to our work.

522
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,731
Your charm can only distract us.

523
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,525
Excuse me.

524
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,340
Isn't she amusing?

525
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,899
Turn that off for a couple minutes,
would you?

526
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,405
You didn't ask about Catherine.

527
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,708
Oh, how is she today?

528
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,781
Still tired.
Colette's looking after her.

529
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,380
Without meaning to,
I think you've upset her a bit.

530
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,047
I've upset her?

531
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,591
She's very fragile.
And she's lonely.

532
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,158
I know she went
to your room last night.

533
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,460
- It was all quite innocent.
-What did she want?

534
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,997
To see someone, I think.

535
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,264
To stretch her legs.

536
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,000
She only stayed two minutes, you know.

537
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,509
I must ask you not to to see her today.

538
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,172
I'm not trying to.

539
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,775
And keep your balcony door shut...
to keep the mosquitoes out.

540
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,213
No problem.

541
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,093
- Shall we begin?
- Of course.

542
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,853
By the way...

543
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,199
yesterday, Catherine spoke to me
about that girl, Madeleine.

544
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,028
What did she say?

545
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,536
She was very odd, really violent.

546
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,875
She told me she hated her.

547
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,143
That may be it.

548
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,216
They were inseparable
for three months.

549
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,757
- What're you doing here?
- They kicked me out.

550
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,295
It seems they're working.

551
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,696
You call that work?
I'm the one who's working here.

552
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,859
You're not complaining, are you?

553
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,395
I'm not. I'm not ungrateful.

554
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,465
But I'd like
that journalist to get lost.

555
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,835
I know.
Something doesn't feel right.

556
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,381
Seems like he's looking
for something.

557
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,311
Something specific.

558
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,408
Like what?

559
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,077
I don't know.

560
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,151
It's too specific.

561
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,215
“Miss Catherine Lecoeur“

562
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,317
“Miss Catherine Lecoeur

563
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,325
and Mr. Christian Legagneur.“

564
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,791
“Legagneur and Lecoeur.
joint account.“

565
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,502
“Deposit, Legagneur.“

566
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,731
“Withdrawal: 75,000 francs.“

567
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,574
“Withdrawal, Legagneur:
90,000 francs.“

568
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,576
“Inheritance from Mr. and Mrs. Lecoeur
to Catherine, minor.“

569
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,243
She's a minor.

570
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,453
“Mr. Christian Legagneur,

571
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,956
one oil painting by Claude Monet.

572
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,055
One oil painting by Monet.

573
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,754
One charcoal sketch
by Claude Monet.“

574
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,931
“Sale of The Blue Mimosas,

575
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,360
a retirement home,

576
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,368
to Mr. Christian Legagneur.“

577
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,934
A retirement home.
The bastard.

578
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,611
“Christian Legagneur,
Capellaci, Max,

579
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,078
and Chapiteau, Colette.“

580
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,640
“Company name:

581
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,878
AIDA Auto Demolition”

582
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,216
I get it now.

583
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,123
You scared me.

584
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:29,465
Sorry. I wanted some aspirin.
I've got a splitting headache.

585
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,070
Come along.
I'll get you some.

586
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,354
It's Bluebeard's den in here.

587
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,654
His repertory costumes.

588
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,489
Mr. Legagneur collects them.

589
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,098
- How many?
- Two.

590
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,689
A sleeping pill?

591
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,428
No, thanks. I don't take them.

592
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,373
Thanks.

593
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,323
You're welcome.

594
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,794
Good night, Mr. Wolf.

595
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,962
Don't make a sound.

596
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,400
- I'm just returning your visit.
- Go away. I'm tired.

597
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,402
- Don't you love me anymore?
- Go away!

598
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:48,204
- I have something funny to tell you.
- I don't want to hear it. Let me sleep.

599
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,776
I intend to wake you up.

600
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,546
You didn't tell me you were rich.

601
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,944
And I mean “were,“
because you no longer are.

602
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,249
Your dear godfather
has robbed you blind.

603
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,550
Sometimes the truth
can make you dizzy.

604
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,423
He took you under his wing
for your money.

605
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,431
He took your funds
and bought companies in his name,

606
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,627
from a travel agency
to a scrapyard.

607
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,797
Even a retirement home.
A little soft shoe, then he robs them.

608
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,464
I don't believe you.

609
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,306
You have the eyes of a liar.
Let me sleep.

610
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,408
All this before you reach legal age,
of course.

611
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,145
He's been good
and generous all his life.

612
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,790
- You must stop taking that medicine.
- Shut up!

613
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,464
What are you doing here?

614
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,433
She fainted. Call a doctor.

615
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,268
Go and get Mr. Legagneur.
No, I'll go. You stay here.

616
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,675
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- <i>We heard a scream.</i>

617
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,837
<i>It's nothing. Go back to bed.</i>

618
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,873
Was that her screaming?

619
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,281
- Poor thing. Can we help?
- Call a doctor!

620
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,116
- I'll do it.
- No.

621
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,279
I'll have no doctor
in this house.

622
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:11,553
Sorry, but it was doctors
who put her in this state.

623
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,956
She's much better now,
thanks to Patricia and myself.

624
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,725
I will have no doctors here.

625
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,129
- I was trying to help.
- I know.

626
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,364
But things are more complicated
than you think.

627
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:25,030
It'll pass. This isn't
the first time, unfortunately.

628
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,836
- She should sniff vinegar.
- It's no use.

629
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,702
She's burning up.

630
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,973
You can all go back to bed.

631
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,479
I'll stay with Wolf.

632
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,951
- You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

633
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:42,216
- Call if you need anything.
- Thank you, my friends.

634
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,828
Catherine, wake up, my child.

635
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,853
My little pet.

636
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,689
How did you get in?

637
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,932
She let out a terrible scream.

638
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,336
I came in,
and she fainted in my arms.

639
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,704
She must've had a nightmare.

640
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,175
There she is.

641
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,084
Go to sleep now.

642
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,582
You can go now, Roland.
Thank you for your help.

643
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,728
Please. It's only natural.

644
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,756
Good night.

645
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,638
Will you sleep now?

646
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,463
And now, my dear friends,

647
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,131
we'll find out which
of our charming finalists

648
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,406
have won a wonderful trip
to Polynesia.

649
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,567
Two weeks in heavenly locations,
first class all the way.

650
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,474
An unforgettable vacation

651
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:14,413
that I'm so happy
to be able to offer you.

652
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,883
Watch now! The number of points
given to each couple

653
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,579
will now appear
on the board behind me.

654
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,988
Control room,

655
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,419
let's have it.

656
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,861
Couple number one:

657
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,022
56 points.

658
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,862
Couple number two: 54.

659
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,630
Couple number three: 51.

660
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,104
Couple number four: 62.

661
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,503
Couple number five: 55.

662
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,274
And, here we go,
couple number six...

663
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,784
Here we go.

664
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,553
59 points.

665
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,953
So, it's couple number four

666
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,651
who wins the trip to Polynesia.

667
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,319
I'll just ask Rosette and Maurice

668
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,561
to come join me.

669
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,037
<i>This envelope contains your happiness.</i>

670
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,697
<i>- Who shall I hand it to?
Whey re so cute.</i>

671
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,175
- <i>She holds the purse strings.</i>
- With <i>my best wishes, Rosette.</i>

672
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,814
<i>Thank you, Christian.
Let me give you a kiss.</i>

673
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,012
Excuse me.

674
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,954
He does that with such kindness.

675
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,792
You like him a lot, don't you?

676
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,993
I'd be ungracious not to.
He's so good to us.

677
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm sure.

678
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,661
<i>And for every couple,</i>

679
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:46,401
<i>a portable color television.</i>

680
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,883
What a night.
So, shall we play the game?

681
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,749
Christian will interrupt us again.

682
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,889
No, he's with Catherine.

683
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,425
He's so worried about her.

684
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,893
You look much better.

685
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,896
You've got more color
than last night.

686
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,261
- Right, Colette?
- Without a doubt.

687
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,733
You faint too often, my dear.

688
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,109
You're much too emotional.

689
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,069
- I wasn't like this before.
- You must've had a nightmare.

690
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,879
Tell me about it.

691
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,450
I don't remember.

692
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,320
I hope the journalist hasn't planted
any ideas in your head.

693
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,421
Don't cry.

694
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,226
Come on now.
Don't cry, my child.

695
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,601
Men have lots of imagination,
you know.

696
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,908
Especially when it comes
to seducing girls.

697
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,074
I'd like to go out.

698
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,318
I must get up, wake myself up.

699
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,853
Of course.
You're not a prisoner.

700
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,992
I'll prepare your clothes.
You can take a walk.

701
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,019
You'll succeed in your undertakings,

702
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,426
but they won't earn you money.

703
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,694
What a waste of time.

704
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,130
However, there is money present.

705
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,195
You've reassured me.

706
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,806
But there will be problems.

707
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,635
You go from hot to cold, don't you?

708
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,947
That's strange.
Your cards are good,

709
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,880
but they're arranged
in an odd pattern.

710
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,483
I'll have to make the best of it.

711
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,825
But, if you want,
you could have an interesting affair.

712
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,759
It's not so bad after all.

713
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,232
It's up to you. But you'll have to
make the first move.

714
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,330
- Am I intruding?
- We just finished.

715
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,804
Did she promise you good things?

716
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,875
- Not bad.
- I'd say so-so.

717
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,911
I've got some news
I think will make you happy.

718
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,310
Catherine's much better this morning.

719
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,577
- You must be very glad.
- I must say I'm relieved.

720
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:12,016
Take a look out the window.

721
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,182
I suppose you want to work?

722
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,928
A resurrection, isn't it?

723
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,271
- You see, no need for a doctor.
- You're right.

724
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,072
Listen, I've got a bit of an appetite.

725
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,573
While I'm having brunch
as the Anglo-Saxons say,

726
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,911
why don't you go keep her company?

727
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,977
I'm sure she'll want to thank you
for last night.

728
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,885
I'll come get you when I'm done
so we can get to work.

729
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,618
And don't whisper sweet nothings
in her ear.

730
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,230
Thank you for last night.

731
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,433
Good. You've learned
your lesson by heart.

732
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,364
Your godfather sent me to you.

733
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,543
We're his puppets,
just like his old folks.

734
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,043
If you've come to torture me,
go away.

735
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:15,116
No, to open your eyes
and make you see the danger.

736
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,909
He's so sure of himself

737
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:21,056
that he thinks anything I say
will turn you more against me.

738
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,986
I'm just asking you to listen.

739
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,890
Don't be so familiar with me.

740
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,724
You approached me first.

741
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,992
Why did you start hating
Madeleine Chevalier?

742
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,636
You loved her,
then suddenly you hated her.

743
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,434
Did she say the same things as me?

744
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,639
She realized that
your godfather had a scheme,

745
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,610
that he was ﬂeecing you,
and that now he's after your life.

746
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,841
You didn't believe her, did you?

747
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,250
And you started hating her.
Is that it?

748
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,487
You told Legagneur.
He laughed his hearty laugh

749
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,156
and said Madeleine was crazy, bitter

750
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,121
and unbalanced.

751
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:07,333
And his proof? One day,
she left without even a good-bye.

752
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,061
She didn't leave.

753
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,333
He did away with her,
one way or another.

754
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,839
Just like he could do away with you.

755
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:25,014
He thought she had no family
to worry about her.

756
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,250
Roland Wolf isn't my name.
It's a pseudonym.

757
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:33,156
And the book on Legagneur is a pretext.
I came to find out about Madeleine.

758
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,825
I'm in your hands.
Do what you want.

759
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,729
Come on, old fellow.
Let's get to work.

760
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,664
There's not much time left.

761
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,667
Are you all right, Catherine?

762
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,001
You all right?

763
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,372
I'm all right.

764
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:52,377
I'm stealing Wolf from you.

765
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,273
- You're looking great.
- You too.

766
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,112
I came to get a piece of bread.

767
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,686
Hungry, huh?
Do you want some jam?

768
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,517
No, I don't like jam.

769
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,147
I saw you left the garden.

770
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,354
Are you throwing him out?

771
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,020
Don't you like him anymore?

772
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,355
I was afraid it would scare this one.

773
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,393
Are you crazy?

774
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,901
Please understand,
I can't stand feathers.

775
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,674
I'm allergic to them.

776
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,543
I almost lost my voice.
I almost died.

777
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,878
Look at me.

778
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,358
Allergies are very dangerous.

779
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,018
It was the bird or me.

780
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,586
Do you understand?

781
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,857
Understand?

782
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,727
Yes, I do.

783
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,986
I heard you come in.
I was waiting.

784
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,650
What's the matter?

785
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,753
- You woke me up.
- Really?

786
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,420
I'm sorry.

787
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,225
I was asleep for too long.

788
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,699
But your eyes entered mine.
I see clearly now.

789
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,435
He killed an injured bird,

790
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,274
just like its life meant nothing.

791
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,314
No more than any other life.

792
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,144
Do you believe me now?
Do you trust me?

793
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:56,155
Yes. Take me with you.
Let's go.

794
01:04:56,492 --> 01:05:01,054
He's got every power to bring
you back, and he'd use it.

795
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,992
He'd call the police.

796
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,767
- Just tell them what you told me.
- There's no “just“ here.

797
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,063
His public status protects him.

798
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:15,671
Publicly, he's the best of men,
oozing goodness and charity.

799
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,773
I have no proof.

800
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,752
He'd laugh with a twinge of sadness
if confronted with such nastiness.

801
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:26,253
We'll find some other way.

802
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,486
You're the one who doesn't trust me.

803
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,787
- Why do you say that?
- I know it's true.

804
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,761
It's because
I didn't believe Madeleine.

805
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,699
You couldn't believe her.

806
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,929
You were blinded.

807
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:45,834
But still...

808
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,803
I feel guilty.

809
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,139
She was my friend.
She was so kind to me.

810
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:55,876
Suddenly I started hating her,
because I didn't want to believe her.

811
01:05:56,285 --> 01:06:00,153
She might have had many faults,
but she never lied.

812
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:04,054
When I told my godfather, I was
so anguished I could hardly breathe.

813
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,956
- It's all my fault.
- No, it's not.

814
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,620
You were in darkness.
You couldn't see the light.

815
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,929
Think of yourself now.
Forget the past. Live in the present.

816
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,195
Tell me I'm not ugly.

817
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,967
Did he put that idea
in your head as well?

818
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,537
In his own way.

819
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,678
He'd say that I was pretty,

820
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,715
but that I shouldn't believe
those who said I wasn't.

821
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:34,145
He's really the most incredible
son-of-a-bitch!

822
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,089
It'll be a close game.
Are you up to it?

823
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,088
Ask me again.

824
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,693
Are you up to it?

825
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,169
Yes.

826
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,037
I want to be all yours.

827
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,600
You won't be mine, nor his.

828
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:57,768
You're your own person.

829
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,548
Then I'm giving myself to you.

830
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,148
Are you awake?

831
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,126
Did you sleep well?

832
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,959
Yes, thanks.
I feel great this morning.

833
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,664
Mr. Legagneur will be glad.

834
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,803
Drink while it's hot.

835
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,467
I'm hungry-

836
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,544
Hungry?

837
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,784
Will you get me some toast?

838
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,541
Certainly.

839
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,947
I I thought maybe you'd like a little jam.

840
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:46,512
No, thanks.

841
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,485
I don't like sugary things.

842
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,516
Some more tea?

843
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,523
No, thanks.

844
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,468
You're so kind to look after me.

845
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,069
- Happiness is a good appetite.
- Quite true.

846
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,375
I'll miss your breakfasts.

847
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:18,309
The weather's so fine
I went around the park.

848
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,648
ﬂogging?
- No, I took a stroll.

849
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,585
Tell me, old fellow.

850
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:28,693
Time's passed quickly, but tomorrow
it's back to the rat race.

851
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,161
<i>I'm taping Happiness for Everyone.</i>

852
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:35,632
You're cordially invited,
if you want.

853
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,332
I'd like to.

854
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,932
I'm very glad.

855
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:43,567
Usually, intellectuals despise
these kinds of shows.

856
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,304
Not in my case.

857
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,576
In any case, you've made me
understand their interest.

858
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,980
You'll write a good book, won't you?

859
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,119
You have everything you need.

860
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,192
I think I've got all I need.

861
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,591
And we've still got today.

862
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,367
Look who's coming.

863
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,106
My dear, be careful of your eyes.
It's very bright.

864
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,110
I've decided to get used to it.

865
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,247
I've decided to shake myself up.

866
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,210
You're very pretty.

867
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,816
May I ask you something?

868
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,584
Anything you want.

869
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,557
I'd like my checkbook.

870
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,155
I want to go shopping in Paris.

871
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,824
Are you sure you feel strong enough?

872
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,163
What do you think, Roland?

873
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,169
I don't want to interfere.

874
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,774
- Does that annoy you?
- Of course not.

875
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,168
I'm happy to see
you're feeling better.

876
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,176
I'm just afraid
you'll tire yourself out.

877
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,839
Well, all right.

878
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,407
I'll ask Max...

879
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,683
to get the car ready
and drive you there.

880
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,867
Don't get carried away.
Enjoy yourself.

881
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,371
Watch your coat.

882
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,050
What's going on?

883
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,682
The battery?

884
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,222
The ignition?

885
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,057
Go check.

886
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,878
This is ridiculous, Max.

887
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,485
I'm not at all happy.

888
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,181
Sorry, Catherine.

889
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,225
- You must be disappointed.
- It doesn't matter.

890
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,025
I'll go another time.

891
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,095
Get it fixed. And quickly.

892
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,863
This isn't good.

893
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,611
Come on, Catherine.

894
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,284
Put on your glasses, my girl.

895
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,053
The sun's so strong.

896
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:46,058
“The sun enlightens the sky,“
like the song says.

897
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:49,197
- You changed your mind?
- The car's broken down.

898
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,856
That great car? What bad luck.

899
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,296
You said it.

900
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,627
“Tomorrow, the motor will hum.

901
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,202
The lights will brighten up
the dark hillsides.“

902
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,936
My dear Roland,
your culture dazzles me.

903
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,073
Now, to work.

904
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,272
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

905
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,947
There's one thing
you must emphasize:

906
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,950
how difficult it is
to move an audience.

907
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,382
That's important.

908
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,668
Catherine's transformed.

909
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,096
She's sunbathing.

910
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:33,734
Sunbathing?

911
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,238
She's not thinking.

912
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,946
She's mad.
What's come over her?

913
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,012
Excuse me for a moment.

914
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,591
Don't lie out in the sun like that.

915
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,225
It's not good for you.
It's even dangerous, I told you.

916
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:05,202
- But it feels healthy.
- Listen, my little girl,

917
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,205
I'm not used
to giving ultimatums.

918
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,638
But either go into the shade,
or go to your room.

919
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,140
It bothers you that I'm better.

920
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,778
Don't be silly,
but don't lie out like that.

921
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,479
I'm going in.

922
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,788
That's right, go inside.

923
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,895
For God's sake.

924
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,949
Mr. Legagneur isn't here?

925
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,250
He'll be back any minute.

926
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,984
Wonderful, isn't it?

927
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,722
Mr. Legagneur loves beautiful books.

928
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:04,389
He loves all beautiful things.

929
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,662
Here he is.

930
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:10,371
Be kind and accompany Catherine
to her room.

931
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,071
I can go alone.

932
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,608
The studio called. You're needed
there at 11:00 tomorrow.

933
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:18,905
As if I didn't know.
They're extraordinary.

934
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,049
So, on to the home stretch?

935
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:25,209
In a sense.

936
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:26,915
My keys, then.

937
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:29,751
Don't take a sip. It's bad.

938
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,052
Bring another bottle, then.

939
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,956
This is the first time it's happened.

940
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,960
You should've tried it.

941
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,031
He tries them enough as it is.

942
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,629
Vacation's over.
Tomorrow it's back to the rat race.

943
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,465
But you love it.

944
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,539
That's true, but these three days
have been very pleasant.

945
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,304
- This one's good.
- I'll get some other glasses.

946
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,040
The roast looks overcooked, Max.

947
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,044
Look at that.

948
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,483
It's like leather. inedible.

949
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,585
This isn't your day, Maxime.

950
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:05,816
- We should make shepherd's pie.
- That's an idea.

951
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,723
That will take three hours.

952
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,456
We can't wait three hours.

953
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,465
Make it for tonight.
Let's have sandwiches now.

954
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,262
Will that be all right with you?

955
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,305
Good idea. That's just fine.

956
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,607
Colette, go get Maxime.

957
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,643
- He's making the fruit salad.
- That can wait.

958
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:30,944
I want him now.

959
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,183
So, Wolfie,

960
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,653
feeling downhearted?

961
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,793
Well, I must say,

962
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,351
thanks to everyone here,
it hasn't felt much like work.

963
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,294
Your work has only just begun.

964
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:51,432
Mr. Max, it's my great pleasure
to raise a glass in your honor.

965
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:56,635
With this admirable shepherd's pie
made from a frightful roast,

966
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,945
you've given us a lesson
on turning defeat into victory.

967
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,811
Long live Maxime!

968
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,546
You're a brave little soldier.
I'm proud of you.

969
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,556
Why?

970
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,321
You've decided to fight your illness.

971
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,122
That's the best way to recover.

972
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,127
- Will you help me?
- Of course.

973
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,497
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

974
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,532
I must get up early
to say good-bye to Mr. Wolf.

975
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,900
Say good-bye now
in case he leaves earlier.

976
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:28,372
- Right, that'd be smart.
- There are taxis at the station.

977
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,135
Well, in that case.

978
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,247
Good-bye, Mr. Wolf.
Glad to have met you.

979
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,384
Me, too. I hope you get well soon.

980
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,382
I'm on the way now.

981
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:41,882
If your godfather will allow me,
I'll give you a kiss.

982
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,091
Go right ahead, my old fellow.

983
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,528
A little formal, aren't we?

984
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,357
Good night, everyone.

985
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,301
Good night, dear.

986
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:00,937
I'll leave you with Manu
and Patricia for a moment,

987
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,407
in Patricia's capable hands.

988
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,376
I've something
to look after with Colette.

989
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,448
I'll join you in a minute
in the library.

990
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,849
Be kind enough to wait.
I've something to ask you.

991
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,511
Turn on the TV.

992
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,524
The soccer final's on tonight, alas.

993
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:22,363
I say “alas,“ but I'm actually
happy to go back.

994
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:26,796
Come with me to my room, Colette.
All my papers are there.

995
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,106
Manu, have one of my cigars.

996
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,437
It's getting tense.

997
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,334
That lousy bastard!

998
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,877
We took care of him, right?

999
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,742
I don't know.

1000
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,115
Better to make certain.

1001
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,912
We just have to do
the same thing as before.

1002
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,180
- Impossible.
- I don't see why.

1003
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,021
Tell him! He gets on my nerves!

1004
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,257
Christian means that
this guy has ties.

1005
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:30,125
It's different than a runaway
no one gives a damn about.

1006
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,135
His disappearance
would create a fuss.

1007
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,161
- Let's “suicide“ him.
- Too risky.

1008
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,707
Catherine's just as dangerous.

1009
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,036
- I can't control her.
- Me neither.

1010
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,906
She's playing around with me.

1011
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:50,476
It's hard to admit it,
but it's true.

1012
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,384
Anyway, it had to happen.

1013
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,181
She's the one we'll take care of.

1014
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,328
You scared me.

1015
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:13,033
Did I?

1016
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,872
What's going on?

1017
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,039
You're packing?

1018
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,117
You want to leave me?

1019
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,314
I suppose you want
to leave with Wolf.

1020
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,259
Are you in love with him?

1021
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,520
Look at that.

1022
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,995
Her little chin is trembling.

1023
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,663
You think I'm going to scold you?

1024
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,107
You think I won't understand?

1025
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,104
You love Wolf? All right.

1026
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,906
Okay. It's the best I can say.

1027
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,045
Want some money?

1028
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,442
Here.

1029
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,846
Buy a few dresses.

1030
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,685
This bag's a bit of a mess.
Colette will help you with it.

1031
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,589
Never mind.

1032
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:10,193
You have to get to the station.
Colette will help.

1033
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,764
And Max, too.

1034
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,037
You already know the way.

1035
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,805
You can't do this to me.

1036
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:24,434
I'm not doing anything.
You're leaving on your own.

1037
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,580
Take her down the back staircase.

1038
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:48,001
Too bad you can't come with us.
We'll visit wine cellars.

1039
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,104
They uncork
such extraordinary wines.

1040
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,100
It'll last 15 days - 15 great days.

1041
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:55,800
Leave him alone.

1042
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,911
No, it's very interesting.

1043
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,644
Did I take too long?

1044
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,810
You didn't exactly take
the smallest one.

1045
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,780
You're not watching the match?

1046
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,750
Patricia didn't want to.

1047
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,124
When France isn't playing,
it doesn't interest me.

1048
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,456
I'd rather watch your show.

1049
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,031
I never could stand watching myself.

1050
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:27,135
- Everything okay?
- She's light as a feather.

1051
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,145
Excuse me, but I've got
to be off early tomorrow.

1052
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,146
I'll go too.
You always wake me in the morning.

1053
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:37,843
- Are you coming?
- Please stay, Roland.

1054
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,645
I've got something to ask you.

1055
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:44,321
In case I don't see you tomorrow,
here's a kiss.

1056
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,861
Good-bye, Patricia.

1057
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,294
Thanks for telling my fortune.

1058
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,032
If you change your mind,
I leave at 8:00.

1059
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,635
Good-bye, Manu.

1060
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,717
It's silly.

1061
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,660
I wanted to suggest a game of chess.

1062
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,722
For the pleasure of beating me.

1063
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,023
I accept.

1064
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,169
- But under one condition.
- Go ahead.

1065
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,671
Tell me why you switch between
formal and informal address.

1066
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,441
Good question.
The answer is simple:

1067
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:39,444
informality comes from the heart,
formality from reason.

1068
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,344
Informality is sentimental,
formality social.

1069
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:45,250
- Is that good enough?
- Interesting.

1070
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,793
- Right or left?
- Right.

1071
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,122
You lose.

1072
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,795
Black can win too.

1073
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,300
Give me a hand.

1074
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,488
Are you coming?

1075
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,957
Shut up and drive.

1076
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,469
I must confess something, Christian.

1077
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,332
May I?

1078
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,275
It won't disturb you?

1079
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,480
“Wolf” is a pseudonym.

1080
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:29,654
My real name is Roland Chevalier.

1081
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,786
Madeleine was my little sister.

1082
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,296
Well, what do you know?

1083
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:51,338
Don't you believe me?

1084
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,908
Impossible.

1085
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,181
She always hated traveling.

1086
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,853
She only wanted to be an actress.

1087
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:05,082
She wouldn't waste her time
in the Seychelles.

1088
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,317
Hollywood, perhaps.

1089
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,263
She didn't mention
Hollywood in her note.

1090
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,467
All I know is that she disappeared.

1091
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,634
What do you want me to say?

1092
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,034
Say, “How much?“

1093
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,208
I don't get it.

1094
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,473
Say, “How much?“

1095
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,048
You want me to say “How much“?

1096
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,582
How much?

1097
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,622
But Catherine's yours,
my old fellow.

1098
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:47,757
Didn't you notice?

1099
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,296
Catherine...

1100
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,066
and the money.

1101
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,144
Grooms are demanding these days.

1102
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:06,747
I'd sell my soul
for the Impressionists.

1103
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:46,616
Who's there?

1104
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,194
It's me.

1105
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:51,458
- Want a beer?
- No time.

1106
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:55,099
Ask Totor to look after
the Cadillac in the morning.

1107
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:57,671
The pink Cadillac? Okay.

1108
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:25,022
SQ?

1109
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,898
I thought I was on the right track.

1110
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,332
Where did I make my mistake?

1111
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,701
You didn't make any specific mistake.

1112
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:37,173
You were just
a little too optimistic...

1113
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,370
and you lost.

1114
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,210
Good night, old fellow.

1115
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:46,876
Sleep well.

1116
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:16,706
My God!

1117
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,675
Totor will crush it at dawn.

1118
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,824
- Wake up, for God's sake!
- Are you nuts?

1119
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:40,024
You must help me.
Catherine's going to be killed.

1120
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,294
- How come?
- She's been kidnapped.

1121
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,667
Do you know
the scrapyards address?

1122
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,774
Manu, wake up.

1123
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:51,777
Give him the scrapyards address.

1124
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,808
Aida's scrapyard?

1125
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:58,379
I took a bottle of
<i>Chateau Neuf du Pape</i> there one day.

1126
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,315
17 Avenue Gabriel Peri.

1127
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,989
- I'll come along.
- I can't wait.

1128
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:10,392
You're both angels.
Not a word to anyone.

1129
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,859
There are taxis at the station.

1130
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:14,524
I know.

1131
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,282
Totor!

1132
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:14,990
Max came by last night.
The pink Cadillac goes first.

1133
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:16,356
Sure, buddy.

1134
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:30,137
Hi there.

1135
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:33,711
- I work with Max. Was he here?
- Yeah, for the pink Cadillac.

1136
01:32:33,781 --> 01:32:35,442
Totor's on it with the crane.

1137
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:11,440
Totor!

1138
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,180
Change of plans!
Forget the Cadillac!

1139
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:17,984
- Should I drop it?
- No!

1140
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,257
Set it down.

1141
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,658
Can't you make up your mind?

1142
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:33,102
What the hell are you doing?

1143
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,601
- Are you off your rocker?
- Help me open the trunk.

1144
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:41,981
There's someone in there!
Help me!

1145
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,639
Get the crowbar.

1146
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,119
Call an ambulance.

1147
01:33:57,164 --> 01:33:58,654
Is she alive?

1148
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:01,659
Yes.

1149
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,306
Who's that chick?

1150
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:15,380
My wife, I think.

1151
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,714
Mrs. Lemonnier and Mr. Loury,

1152
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:24,085
who may soon be
Mr. and Mrs. Loury.

1153
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,723
- Remind us where you're from.
- From Pontoise.

1154
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:33,925
I was a grocer
in Pontoise for 40 years.

1155
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:36,202
Now I'm retired,

1156
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,668
and I feel great.

1157
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,632
I can understand.
And you, Simone?

1158
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:44,438
- Simone, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Legagneur.

1159
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,907
I'm a grandmother,
and even a great-grandmother.

1160
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,846
I used to be a laundress.

1161
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:55,045
A great-grandmother and a laundress.
Do you believe that?

1162
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:58,620
How's it feel to be
a great-grandmother and engaged?

1163
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:04,257
Her little chin is trembling.

1164
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,735
But she told her children
and grandchildren

1165
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:11,963
that she met a fiancé
thanks to this show.

1166
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,970
I certainly did.
And they're very happy.

1167
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:18,373
And I'm happy they're happy.

1168
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,379
But I can tell you,
they'll be a little jealous

1169
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,245
when they find out what you've won.

1170
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:25,949
A trip.

1171
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,712
My God! It can't be.

1172
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:30,049
And not just any trip.

1173
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,089
A trip around the world.

1174
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:37,257
Yes, that's what you've won -
a trip around the world.

1175
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:41,231
And now, a young couple will
present you with the tickets.

1176
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,892
Be sure not to lose them.

1177
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:47,264
A young couple
waiting at the back of the studio.

1178
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,979
Our surprise guests.

1179
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,783
No need to tell you
everything has an end.

1180
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,484
Mr. Loury, I must confess
something to you.

1181
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,552
I don't like old age.

1182
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:40,523
- It frightens me.
- It shouldn't.

1183
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:43,561
Same with the audience.
It disgusts me.

1184
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,495
Deep down,
you know what I like? This.

1185
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:51,304
So, my golden-age fiancés,
isn't that wonderful?

1186
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,134
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's horrible!

1187
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,004
It's a total fraud.

1188
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,805
Because crimes of the heart
are the worst.

1189
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:07,343
We make you believe
there's a little heart somewhere,

1190
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:10,013
and you gobble it up!

1191
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:12,916
Flaunting what should remain private -

1192
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,995
isn't that a good definition
of obscenity?

1193
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:22,059
You couldn't know.
Anyway, it's not important.

1194
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:29,040
To think I've always loved
beautiful things.

1195
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:33,645
Why do we always do
the opposite of what we want?

1196
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,282
Maybe life forced you?

1197
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:38,051
Yeah, right.

1198
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,176
Life never forces anyone to do shit!

1199
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,618
No, it's something else.

1200
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:47,023
Something else.
I've always believed...

1201
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,257
that life was a game.

1202
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:54,390
And that I was the manager
of the toy department.

1203
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:58,595
It seems we're having
problems backstage.

1204
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:00,933
That's the risk of broadcasting live.

1205
01:38:01,108 --> 01:38:04,600
Gentlemen, allow me to finish
the show with a ﬂourish.

1206
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:05,972
So.

1207
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,443
Young wolf with a big appetite,

1208
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,542
chevalier at another's table,

1209
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:17,489
it turns out black can win after all.

1210
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:22,551
Ladies and gentlemen,

1211
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,460
I have only one thing left to say,

1212
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,931
from the bottom of my heart:

1213
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,735
Get fucked!
