1
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:36,156
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

2
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:42,591
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

3
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,684
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

4
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,436
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:56,065
Sure.
I'll take one.

6
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,588
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:03,805
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

8
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,187
I've watched you for days.

9
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:12,829
You're everything a man could ever want.

10
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,265
It's not just your face,

11
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:19,743
your figure, or your voice.

12
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:24,577
It's your eyes.

13
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,123
All the things I see in your eyes.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,601
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,544
I see a crazy calm.

16
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,131
You're sick of running.

17
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,214
You're ready to face what you have to face.

18
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,012
But you don't want to face it alone.

19
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:54,978
No.

20
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:57,145
I don't want to face it alone.

21
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:07,397
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

22
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:10,974
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.</i>

23
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,868
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

24
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,780
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right.</i>

25
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,283
<i>That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, Far away.</i>

26
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,363
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

27
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,980
<i>The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

28
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,689
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

29
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:48,030
<i>I'll never know
what she was running from.</i>

30
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,471
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning.</i>

31
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:45,270
<i>Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.</i>

32
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:48,128
<i>Early retirement.
Not my idea.</i>

33
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,005
<i>Doctor's orders.
Heart condition.</i>

34
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,652
<i>"Angina", he calls it.</i>

35
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,843
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.</i>

36
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:01,458
<i>It, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears</i>

37
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,937
<i>and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.</i>

38
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:09,015
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

39
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:13,686
<i>About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

40
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:17,023
<i>And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

41
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,847
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.</i>

42
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,612
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

43
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,844
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

44
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,772
Let go of my coat, Bob.

45
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,747
You're draggin' me down with you.

46
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,113
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

47
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,412
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

48
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,810
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

49
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:50,656
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

50
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,756
Victim number four!

51
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:55,249
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

52
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,493
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

53
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,329
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

54
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:05,693
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

55
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,311
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

56
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,287
Settle down and think straight.

57
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,024
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

58
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,009
You ain't savin' anyone.

59
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,730
You got a great attitude, Bob.

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,116
Real credit to the force, you are.

61
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:27,664
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

62
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,382
Heck, Bob,

63
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,237
maybe you are right.

64
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:39,508
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

65
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:43,027
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

66
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,655
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

67
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,407
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

68
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,862
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

69
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,638
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

70
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,007
You've been very quiet.

71
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,213
Don't be scared.

72
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,351
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

73
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:07,252
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

74
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:10,484
He's a very nice man.

75
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,480
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her. And it hits.</i>

76
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:18,003
<i>Wicked spot of indigestion.</i>

77
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,371
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

78
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,683
... lighthearted
and momentary digression.

79
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,531
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

80
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,559
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

81
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:33,884
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

82
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,984
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

83
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,146
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.</i>

84
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,927
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

85
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,555
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

86
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:48,720
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

87
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:51,923
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.</i>

88
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,937
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

89
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,881
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

90
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:59,403
shall surely be athwart us.

91
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:12,398
<i>Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

92
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,412
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

93
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,353
<i>Get over it.</i>

94
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,530
<i>She needs you.</i>

95
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,257
We're all done here, Benny.

96
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:25,709
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

97
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:27,570
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

98
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,881
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

99
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:35,472
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

100
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,512
You must be awfully scared now.

101
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,849
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

102
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,589
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

103
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:51,248
That's all, just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

104
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:54,671
Don't you cry now.

105
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,714
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

106
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,025
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

107
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,613
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

108
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,627
<i>Not anymore.</i>

109
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,527
<i>Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

110
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:19,212
<i>What the hell?
Go out with a bang.</i>

111
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:21,361
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

112
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,921
<i>I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,</i>

113
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:28,659
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

114
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:33,195
<i>No screams.
Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late.</i>

115
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,189
Ooh!

116
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:47,312
<i>It's nothing, barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.</i>

117
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,818
Roark.
Give it up.

118
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,101
Let the girl go.

119
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,268
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

120
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,282
You know who I am.

121
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,497
You know who my father is!

122
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,991
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

123
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:11,690
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

124
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,739
Sure, I can.

125
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,886
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

126
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,820
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

127
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,858
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

128
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,039
<i>Both of them.</i>

129
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,104
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

130
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,029
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

131
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:55,498
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

132
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,751
Never better.

133
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:01,808
I'm ready to kick your ass.

134
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,618
<i>Keep him talking.
Buy time.</i>

135
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:07,245
<i>Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.</i>

136
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:11,091
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

137
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:14,898
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -
skinny little Nancy.</i>

138
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,653
<i>He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.</i>

139
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,176
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

140
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:22,033
Hey, don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

141
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:25,265
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at.

142
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:28,142
You shoot your partner in the back...

143
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,281
then you try to scare a little girl.

144
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:34,481
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

145
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,620
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

146
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,593
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

147
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,950
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

148
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:45,673
You'll never be able to stop me.

149
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:57,229
<i>I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.</i>

150
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:00,902
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

151
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,144
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

152
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:16,170
<i>Things go dark.
I don't mind much.</i>

153
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:20,495
<i>Getting sleepy.
It's OK.</i>

154
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,768
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

155
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:25,165
<i>An old man dies.</i>

156
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,726
<i>A little girl lives.</i>

157
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,740
<i>Fair trade.</i>

158
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,750
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

159
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,982
<i>It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

160
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,502
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

161
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,899
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

162
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,649
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

163
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:51,241
I want you.

164
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,621
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

165
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,030
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

166
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,659
<i>The goddess.</i>

167
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,998
I need you.

168
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,218
<i>Goldie.</i>

169
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,625
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

170
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,558
<i>Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

171
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,627
<i>And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.</i>

172
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:38,636
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.</i>

173
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,896
<i>You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

174
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,620
<i>aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.</i>

175
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,439
<i>She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.</i>

176
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:51,755
<i>Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

177
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,070
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?</i>

178
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:58,478
<i>Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,</i>

179
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,738
<i>giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?</i>

180
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,491
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

181
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:07,377
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

182
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:09,708
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

183
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,174
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much.</i>

184
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,073
<i>Showing up before anybody
but me and the killer</i>

185
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,269
<i>could know there's been a murder.</i>

186
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:22,721
<i>Somebody paid good money
for this frame.</i>

187
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,388
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

188
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,456
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

189
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,716
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie.</i>

190
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,506
Open up, police!

191
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,261
I'll be right out.

192
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,853
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

193
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:21,672
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight.</i>

194
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:25,355
<i>But you were a friend and more
when I needed one.</i>

195
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:28,002
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

196
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,042
<i>it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.</i>

197
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:34,657
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.</i>

198
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:37,611
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to</i>

199
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:41,121
<i>will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

200
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:42,540
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

201
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,902
Claire?

202
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:18,666
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

203
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:23,461
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

204
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,489
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

205
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,187
No.

206
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,719
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

207
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,991
Thanks.
You're the best.

208
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,514
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

209
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,691
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

210
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:42,143
<i>With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.</i>

211
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:45,221
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i>

212
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:48,933
<i>She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.</i>

213
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,903
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

214
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,288
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

215
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:00,738
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

216
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:03,462
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

217
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,435
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

218
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:09,063
This isn't some barroom brawl.

219
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:12,199
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

220
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:13,790
Hey, hey.
This is big.

221
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:17,444
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

222
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,379
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

223
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,771
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

224
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:27,840
They're back.
There's no choices left.

225
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,633
And I'm ready for war.

226
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,098
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

227
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,546
Ah.

228
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:37,507
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

229
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,518
But I'm out now.

230
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:43,961
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

231
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:47,931
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

232
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,501
<i>So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?</i>

233
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:57,119
<i>Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.</i>

234
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,842
<i>So you hit the saloons. The bad places,</i>

235
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,033
<i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

236
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,661
<i>Well, I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

237
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:09,509
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

238
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:13,662
<i>Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

239
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,769
<i>- Leave your hands off Nancy.
... and you could find anything.</i>

240
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,454
That coat looks like Baghdad.

241
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,945
So does your face.
Take off!

242
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,464
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

243
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,871
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

244
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:39,814
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig,
but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i>

245
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,953
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

246
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,635
<i>shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.</i>

247
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:49,021
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

248
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:51,428
What'll it be, Marv?

249
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,276
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

250
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,853
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

251
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,914
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

252
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:18,558
<i>He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.</i>

253
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,994
<i>He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,</i>

254
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,363
<i>swinging an ax into somebody's face.</i>

255
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:28,158
<i>Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

256
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:31,975
<i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i>

257
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,317
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

258
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,165
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

259
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:47,549
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

260
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:52,412
<i>I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

261
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,433
- Take it off.
- What?

262
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,831
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

263
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:07,286
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

264
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,748
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

265
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:15,102
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

266
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,305
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

267
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,455
I don't hear you giving me any names.

268
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,974
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

269
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:34,436
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

270
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,750
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

271
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:46,586
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

272
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:49,885
Thanks again.

273
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:56,800
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

274
00:20:56,867 --> 00:21:00,828
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

275
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:03,292
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

276
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,402
Bastard.

277
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,442
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

278
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,825
Feel like talking, Louie?

279
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,290
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

280
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,054
How many for the kill?

281
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,615
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

282
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,026
He'll never talk.

283
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:29,982
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

284
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,978
<i>Connelly talks.
They all talk.</i>

285
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,047
And what have been
your sins, my son?

286
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,569
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

287
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,581
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

288
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:46,515
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

289
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,635
You're speaking figuratively.

290
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:53,113
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

291
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,578
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

292
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:58,714
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

293
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:04,449
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

294
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:05,820
Tortured 'em first.

295
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:10,049
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

296
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,802
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

297
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,539
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

298
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:20,215
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

299
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,898
Just give me a damn name.

300
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:27,168
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

301
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:30,083
feeding me garbage like that.

302
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,292
It can't be that big.

303
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,593
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

304
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,480
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

305
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,436
And while you're at it,

306
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:43,644
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

307
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:46,041
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

308
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:48,055
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

309
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,395
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

310
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:52,323
Amen.

311
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,499
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

312
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:01,913
<i>or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

313
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:05,912
<i>Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.</i>

314
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,853
Goldie.

315
00:23:16,452 --> 00:23:17,660
Goldie!

316
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:30,070
It couldn't be Goldie.

317
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:34,270
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i>

318
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,981
<i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

319
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,899
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

320
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,338
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

321
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:45,203
<i>and that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

322
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,924
<i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

323
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:56,884
<i>The cold thing, it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.</i>

324
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:00,115
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

325
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:01,851
<i>People have died here...</i>

326
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,179
<i>... the wrong way.</i>

327
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:09,696
I don't want to fight, pooch.

328
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,287
I got no gripe with you.

329
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:19,325
Easy, boy.

330
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,021
<i>No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.</i>

331
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,706
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i>

332
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:31,667
<i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i>

333
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,362
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

334
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,550
Here we go.

335
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,606
<i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

336
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:57,628
<i>I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

337
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:01,176
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

338
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,041
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

339
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,544
You killed Goldie.

340
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,203
It was...

341
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:12,214
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

342
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:15,254
<i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i>

343
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,815
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

344
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:20,270
<i>A killer born.</i>

345
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:22,735
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

346
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:38,808
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

347
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:42,107
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

348
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:46,835
The wolf just gets scraps.

349
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,791
Bones.

350
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:51,131
It's him.

351
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:55,447
He eats people.

352
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,695
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

353
00:25:59,772 --> 00:26:01,939
Just like they were steaks.

354
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:04,250
Now he's got both of us.

355
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:07,415
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

356
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:10,906
Just look at the heads on the wall.

357
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,006
The heads on the wall.

358
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,548
The heads on the wall.

359
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:19,422
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

360
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:23,479
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

361
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,164
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

362
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:30,968
He made me watch!

363
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,444
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

364
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:44,855
<i>Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i>

365
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,116
<i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i>

366
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,705
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

367
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,184
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

368
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,399
Any leads?

369
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:01,043
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

370
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,752
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

371
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,300
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

372
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,410
The dead one.

373
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:13,587
Goldie.

374
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:16,023
I didn't know she was a hooker.

375
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:19,121
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

376
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:25,584
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

377
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:27,253
She must have shown you quite a time.

378
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,392
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

379
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,510
Kevin!

380
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:40,113
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

381
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:42,099
I'll see you later, Kevin.

382
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:52,686
Let's go.

383
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:10,648
They're done checking the house.

384
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:12,653
They're coming this way.

385
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,693
Bastards.
I'll show them.

386
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:24,497
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

387
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,220
No, don't shoot!
Please.

388
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,455
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

389
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:31,891
He's unconscious and unarmed,

390
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,825
so there's no need to kill him.

391
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,996
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

392
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:44,243
Here's a sign!

393
00:28:58,427 --> 00:29:02,004
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

394
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,783
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.</i>

395
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,535
<i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

396
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:18,058
<i>so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.</i>

397
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:22,229
<i>It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

398
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:27,724
<i>Just a name -
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

399
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,765
<i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i>

400
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,214
<i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i>

401
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:39,060
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i>

402
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,570
<i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

403
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:47,432
<i>And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

404
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

405
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:57,195
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

406
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,094
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

407
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:00,945
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

408
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:03,083
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

409
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,929
<i>And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.</i>

410
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:09,106
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

411
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:14,256
<i>What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

412
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:16,625
<i>A maniac.</i>

413
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,993
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

414
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:22,062
<i>Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

415
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:24,076
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

416
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,336
<i>The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

417
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:34,060
<i>For an hour or so,
I asked around about Goldie.</i>

418
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,812
<i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i>

419
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,922
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

420
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:41,645
<i>and if she was, she has roots here -</i>

421
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:44,436
<i>friends, maybe even family.</i>

422
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:51,916
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

423
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,504
Ha.

424
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:05,774
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

425
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:09,735
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

426
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:12,267
No wonder I'm seeing things.

427
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:13,744
Bastard!

428
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:21,070
He's crazy.

429
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:24,072
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

430
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:27,956
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

431
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:30,258
Because that's my name, you ape.

432
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:35,091
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

433
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:37,422
I guess she was the nice one.

434
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,830
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

435
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:48,805
What did you do to them?

436
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,251
You crazy goddamn broad.

437
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:53,226
Just take a look at this mug.

438
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:57,321
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

439
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,870
None of you would, but Goldie.

440
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,977
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

441
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:09,098
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

442
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:14,056
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

443
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:19,340
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

444
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,917
So, go ahead, doll.

445
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:27,530
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

446
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:36,142
Aw, nuts.

447
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,374
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

448
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:45,291
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

449
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:47,152
You sat there and took it,

450
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:50,067
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

451
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:54,440
Well, sure, I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

452
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,643
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

453
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,715
and I don't hurt girls.

454
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,026
I need a pair of handcuffs.

455
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,028
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

456
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:08,902
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

457
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,750
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

458
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,088
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

459
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:17,514
I know that sounds crazy.

460
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,784
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

461
00:33:20,851 --> 00:33:25,186
<i>Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.</i>

462
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:27,564
<i>I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,</i>

463
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:32,388
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one, and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

464
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:36,809
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

465
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:41,250
<i>I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

466
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,398
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

467
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,441
<i>Yeah, yeah.
This'll do.</i>

468
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:50,763
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

469
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:54,091
and a spool of razor wire...

470
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:59,145
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

471
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,089
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

472
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:03,623
You can bet your ass.

473
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:07,824
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

474
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:11,305
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

475
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:16,330
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

476
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:20,703
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

477
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,494
You know, the way I look.

478
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:27,915
<i>I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

479
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,831
<i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i>

480
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,954
<i>I check the list -
rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

481
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,886
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

482
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,131
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

483
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:44,995
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

484
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,527
Keep the engine runnin'.

485
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:52,198
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

486
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,125
Kill him for me, Marv.

487
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:58,115
Kill him good.

488
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,879
I won't let you down, Goldie.

489
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,247
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

490
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:21,735
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.</i>

491
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,607
Come on, you son of a bitch.

492
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:40,330
<i>Damn, he's slick.</i>

493
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,284
Is that the best you can do, creep?

494
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:59,818
<i>That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

495
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,159
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

496
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:13,445
<i>I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

497
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:17,032
<i>My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

498
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,743
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

499
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:23,266
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

500
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:26,018
Oh, but I want to...

501
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:29,988
<i>I'm sorry, kid,
but I haven't even started with this creep.</i>

502
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:34,112
<i>And I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i>

503
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:37,085
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

504
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,231
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

505
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,079
It's all that sawing and tying.

506
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:46,272
It's not as easy as it looks.

507
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:51,432
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

508
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:57,800
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

509
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:02,950
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

510
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:08,100
Well, what do you know?

511
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:11,389
Look who's here.

512
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:12,895
Here he comes.

513
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,957
That's a good dog.

514
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:25,889
<i>He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

515
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,450
<i>and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.</i>

516
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:32,267
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i>

517
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:36,323
<i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i>

518
00:37:36,745 --> 00:37:39,114
<i>He never screams.</i>

519
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,964
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

520
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:48,330
<i>and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes", like always.</i>

521
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:51,044
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

522
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:53,960
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

523
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:56,837
<i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

524
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:59,493
<i>Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

525
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:01,824
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

526
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,439
<i>It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.</i>

527
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,204
So, what do you want me to do with her?

528
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:11,711
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

529
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:14,751
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

530
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:17,475
Hell, no.
I like it here.

531
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:23,047
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i>

532
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,319
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

533
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:29,482
<i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i>

534
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,361
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

535
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:33,730
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

536
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:36,645
<i>So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose -</i>

537
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:41,057
<i>hell, I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.</i>

538
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:48,000
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

539
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,685
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

540
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:09,118
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

541
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:12,282
The dog ate the rest.

542
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,675
Oh, my God.
You monster.

543
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:26,437
You demon.

544
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,864
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

545
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:34,838
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

546
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,655
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

547
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:44,160
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

548
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:46,404
When he came to me...

549
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:50,048
he was a tormented boy.

550
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:54,431
Tormented by guilt.

551
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:57,605
I tried to counsel him.

552
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:03,350
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

553
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:08,318
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

554
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,195
What the hell do you know?

555
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,631
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

556
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:16,517
He didn't just eat their bodies,

557
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,972
he ate their souls.

558
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:22,818
And I joined in.

559
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,025
They were all whores.

560
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:32,763
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

561
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:38,037
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

562
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:40,349
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

563
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,660
<i>And then with you.</i>

564
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:44,098
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

565
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,302
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

566
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,814
Who would believe a thug like you?

567
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,416
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

568
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:55,070
<i>I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

569
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:56,546
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

570
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:59,423
And now he's dead and you're here to...

571
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,790
eliminate me.

572
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,875
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

573
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:13,339
Killing a helpless old fart?

574
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:16,091
The killing, no.

575
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:18,844
No satisfaction.

576
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:23,322
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

577
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:28,251
Kevin...

578
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,701
we're going home.

579
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,647
You can scream now if you want to.

580
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:50,491
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

581
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,025
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>

582
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:56,159
<i>the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.</i>

583
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:59,093
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

584
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:08,089
<i>Jerks.</i>

585
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:11,810
<i>They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.</i>

586
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:13,594
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

587
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,468
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

588
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:19,645
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

589
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,999
<i>Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

590
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:27,806
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.</i>

591
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:31,546
<i>After a while,
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

592
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:34,069
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

593
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:36,955
<i>before the cops kick them out
from under me.</i>

594
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,969
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

595
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:43,314
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

596
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,337
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

597
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:48,818
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.</i>

598
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:53,201
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

599
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:57,564
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession,
they'll kill my mom.</i>

600
00:42:57,632 --> 00:43:00,950
<i>I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.</i>

601
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:03,990
<i>From then on,
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.</i>

602
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:08,286
<i>They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill,</i>

603
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:12,410
<i>but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

604
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,779
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

605
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:19,833
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.</i>

606
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:23,707
<i>Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,</i>

607
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:26,843
<i>when I get my first surprise in 18 months.</i>

608
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,689
<i>My only visitor.</i>

609
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:33,623
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

610
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:36,692
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

611
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:44,153
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

612
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,318
I... I got confused again.

613
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:49,908
Just seeing you like this.

614
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:54,616
You can call me Goldie.

615
00:44:03,362 --> 00:44:06,259
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

616
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:08,858
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

617
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:10,651
<i>The goddess.</i>

618
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:14,008
<i>Goldie.</i>

619
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:16,568
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

620
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:22,485
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.</i>

621
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:26,897
<i>They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

622
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:31,481
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

623
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:34,300
<i>And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.</i>

624
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,823
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

625
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,508
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

626
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:42,164
You heard the man.
Hit it.

627
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:53,970
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

628
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:07,703
He's gone.

629
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,902
Forget it, man.

630
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:28,974
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

631
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,506
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

632
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:34,910
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

633
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:39,130
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

634
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:40,923
Ha. It meant plenty.

635
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,088
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

636
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,677
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

637
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,269
I know you're angry, baby.

638
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:51,376
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

639
00:45:51,453 --> 00:45:53,208
There's a difference
between getting honked off

640
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:54,934
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

641
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,991
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

642
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:01,523
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

643
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:04,208
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

644
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:07,066
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

645
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:09,981
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

646
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:12,340
That hurt, Shellie.

647
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:17,807
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

648
00:46:17,883 --> 00:46:20,300
I am impossible to get.

649
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:26,611
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

650
00:46:26,678 --> 00:46:29,401
Get help and get lost.

651
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:31,089
Just open the door.

652
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:35,865
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

653
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:39,855
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

654
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:44,659
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

655
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:48,246
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

656
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:51,660
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

657
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:53,779
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

658
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,369
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

659
00:46:56,445 --> 00:47:01,173
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

660
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:06,573
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

661
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,102
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

662
00:47:10,169 --> 00:47:13,171
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

663
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:15,281
You feel like taking them on?

664
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:18,292
You are teasing me, baby.

665
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:21,773
Some of my best friends...

666
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:24,401
But you're really pushing my buttons.

667
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,606
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

668
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:29,397
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

669
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:32,533
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

670
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:35,410
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

671
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,683
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

672
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,618
All right.
All right, all right!

673
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:46,554
Troops, make yourself at home.

674
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:57,803
You brought your whole pack with you?

675
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,594
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

676
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:02,253
You're gonna love this, baby.

677
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,044
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

678
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,458
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

679
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:10,290
and it's gonna be great.

680
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,399
I ain't calling up nobody.

681
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:21,366
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

682
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:25,624
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

683
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:28,914
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

684
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:32,280
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

685
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:36,241
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

686
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,676
'cause you scared him so bad.

687
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:44,622
You think
I have no feelings at all.

688
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:46,771
If you're gonna slug me,

689
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:49,743
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

690
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:53,771
There you go,
lying about me again,

691
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,332
right in front of my friends.

692
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:59,573
I have never hit a woman in my life.

693
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:07,082
That's showing her, man.

694
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:11,504
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

695
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:14,419
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

696
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:18,130
- I gotta take a leak.
- Oh!

697
00:49:18,197 --> 00:49:20,566
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

698
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,115
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

699
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:26,570
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

700
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:30,319
There you go, after my nuts again.

701
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,592
But I forgive you.

702
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:34,568
I'm a generous guy.

703
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:38,922
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

704
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:42,000
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

705
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:45,424
My temper you don't have to worry about.

706
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,452
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

707
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:52,118
Ooh.
I've been told.

708
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:58,802
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

709
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:01,516
Answer me!

710
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,597
Oh, I don't need this grief.

711
00:50:03,664 --> 00:50:09,294
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

712
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:14,070
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

713
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:17,608
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

714
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:21,991
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

715
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:27,189
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

716
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:29,519
You didn't flush.

717
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:22,351
Troops, get outta here.

718
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,490
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

719
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:26,322
Now!

720
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:46,413
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

721
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,300
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

722
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,429
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

723
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,236
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

724
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:59,178
Dwight, he was from a while back,

725
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:02,410
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

726
00:52:02,477 --> 00:52:06,092
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

727
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:08,499
And it was only once.

728
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:10,465
I've done some dumb things.

729
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,450
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

730
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:15,116
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

731
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:19,279
But this guy, he's a menace.

732
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,089
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

733
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:25,541
I'll call you later.

734
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,056
No, don't go!

735
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,358
<i>Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out</i>

736
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:32,005
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter.</i>

737
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:35,591
<i>- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop", but I can't be sure.</i>

738
00:52:36,244 --> 00:52:39,686
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,</i.
but I can't just go home and forget about it,</i>

739
00:52:39,763 --> 00:52:42,985
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.</i>

740
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:48,423
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.</i>

741
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,655
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

742
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,570
You fool.

743
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:56,814
You damned fool.

744
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,569
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

745
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:02,051
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

746
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:04,036
<i>I'm speeding.</i>

747
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:08,716
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

748
00:53:08,783 --> 00:53:12,974
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

749
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:16,043
<i>the last thing you want
is to get noticed.</i>

750
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:21,605
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

751
00:53:21,682 --> 00:53:24,712
<i>there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.</i>

752
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:30,179
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,
or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

753
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:34,408
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

754
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:36,968
Watch it, Jack!

755
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:44,391
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

756
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:47,815
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

757
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:50,817
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

758
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:55,084
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i>

759
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:59,342
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

760
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,536
<i>He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.</i>

761
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:06,698
<i>The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.</i>

762
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:08,654
<i>If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules,</i>

763
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,023
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i>

764
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,725
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse.</i>

765
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:25,005
Hey, baby.

766
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:29,858
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

767
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,557
Aw, sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

768
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:37,569
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

769
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:41,453
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

770
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,524
I don't do talk jobs, either.

771
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:48,453
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

772
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,069
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

773
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:54,179
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

774
00:54:54,255 --> 00:54:57,698
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

775
00:54:57,775 --> 00:55:00,077
well...

776
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:02,541
there's only so much a man can take.

777
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:04,680
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

778
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:07,049
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

779
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:09,638
The Amigo's a fag joint.

780
00:55:10,156 --> 00:55:15,852
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

781
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:21,194
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

782
00:55:21,261 --> 00:55:23,716
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

783
00:55:23,783 --> 00:55:25,730
Everything's under control.

784
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:28,837
Enjoy the show.

785
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,724
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

786
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,572
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

787
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,507
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

788
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:40,394
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

789
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:42,177
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

790
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:46,339
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

791
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:49,312
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

792
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:52,285
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

793
00:55:52,362 --> 00:55:56,102
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

794
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:58,174
One of them thinks he is.

795
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,188
He's outta control.

796
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:03,563
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

797
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:07,102
Us helpless little girls.

798
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:11,581
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

799
00:56:11,686 --> 00:56:15,100
<i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i>

800
00:56:15,177 --> 00:56:17,795
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

801
00:56:17,862 --> 00:56:20,231
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

802
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,667
from seeing what Miho can do.

803
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:26,561
And she's been aching for some practice.

804
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:32,065
<i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

805
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:36,132
<i>- Deadly little Miho.
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.</i>

806
00:56:36,678 --> 00:56:40,294
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

807
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,950
You're a sassy little thing.

808
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:47,649
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

809
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:51,620
<i>The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.</i>

810
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:55,427
<i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i>

811
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:58,726
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i>

812
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:01,891
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

813
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:06,465
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

814
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:07,913
And they won't.

815
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,014
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

816
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:13,437
<i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i>

817
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:17,599
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

818
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:20,515
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

819
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,718
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

820
00:57:23,785 --> 00:57:27,458
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

821
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,865
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

822
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,085
You wanna see it?

823
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,458
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

824
00:57:38,535 --> 00:57:42,428
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

825
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,861
You seen this one?

826
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:49,314
Get in the car.

827
00:57:49,419 --> 00:57:53,860
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

828
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:11,582
Oh, God, no!

829
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:15,169
This is crazy!

830
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:18,458
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

831
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:26,936
Go ahead.

832
00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:30,149
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

833
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,479
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

834
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:36,229
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

835
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:42,597
I got you right where I want you.

836
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:45,723
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

837
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,147
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

838
00:58:52,225 --> 00:58:53,472
Yeesh.

839
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:02,774
This isn't funny.

840
00:59:03,494 --> 00:59:06,937
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

841
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:09,152
Every one of you is gonna burn.

842
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:12,988
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

843
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:16,229
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

844
00:59:17,025 --> 00:59:20,478
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

845
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:24,228
I told you to shut up.

846
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,104
I can't see.

847
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:33,118
What's happening?

848
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:36,935
I can't see.

849
00:59:36,992 --> 00:59:39,610
I can't hear anything.

850
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:43,005
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

851
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:46,486
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you?

852
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,224
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

853
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:57,026
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

854
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:02,301
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

855
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:06,463
<i>and going through their pockets,
divvying up cash when they find it.</i>

856
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,505
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

857
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:10,337
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

858
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:14,202
<i>Mastercard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,</i>

859
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:16,446
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

860
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:20,292
<i>that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

861
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:22,143
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

862
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:26,650
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

863
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,057
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

864
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:35,866
<i>There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket.</i>

865
01:00:35,943 --> 01:00:38,973
<i>I couldn't quite make out what she said.</i>

866
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,380
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop".</i>

867
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:43,960
<i>She said "cop."</i>

868
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,096
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

869
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:50,366
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

870
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:53,080
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

871
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:58,211
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.</i>

872
01:00:58,278 --> 01:01:02,105
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.</i>

873
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,895
<i>The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.</i>

874
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:09,748
<i>They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

875
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:14,044
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling. They send him packing,</i>

876
01:01:14,112 --> 01:01:16,663
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

877
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,782
<i>That's the rules.</i>

878
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,671
<i>That's the truce.</i>

879
01:01:20,738 --> 01:01:23,155
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

880
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:26,224
<i>That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

881
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,168
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

882
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:31,096
<i>It'll be war.</i>

883
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:34,510
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

884
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:36,821
<i>women's blood.</i>

885
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:39,228
The cops!
The mob!

886
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:41,875
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

887
01:01:41,942 --> 01:01:45,654
The hell they will!
We got guns.

888
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,725
We'll fight the cops and the mob

889
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:51,101
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

890
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:52,721
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

891
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:55,953
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

892
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,061
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

893
01:01:59,156 --> 01:02:00,470
I'll hide the bodies.

894
01:02:00,566 --> 01:02:03,884
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

895
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,378
The cops know Rafferty came here.

896
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,389
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

897
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:11,288
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

898
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:14,136
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

899
01:02:14,203 --> 01:02:16,026
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

900
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:20,111
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

901
01:02:20,188 --> 01:02:22,672
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

902
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:25,366
You got what you wanted out of me!

903
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:28,915
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

904
01:02:28,982 --> 01:02:33,038
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

905
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:35,733
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

906
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:39,761
<i>One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.</i>

907
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:43,348
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

908
01:02:43,415 --> 01:02:46,513
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

909
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,198
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

910
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:53,072
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

911
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:55,316
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

912
01:02:55,383 --> 01:02:57,867
Get that gun out of my face now!

913
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,135
Bastard!

914
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:08,819
I forgot how quick you are.

915
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:12,339
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

916
01:03:12,406 --> 01:03:14,928
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off,</i>

917
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:18,093
<i>shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.</i>

918
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,459
<i>An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years</i>

919
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:25,650
<i>between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.</i>

920
01:03:26,484 --> 01:03:29,170
A hardtop with a decent engine.

921
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,510
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

922
01:03:33,495 --> 01:03:36,525
I'll always love you, baby.

923
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:40,342
Always... and never.

924
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,028
Where'd you find that heap?

925
01:03:50,105 --> 01:03:53,481
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

926
01:03:53,557 --> 01:03:56,943
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

927
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,918
you think maybe I could go home?

928
01:03:58,995 --> 01:04:02,994
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

929
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:05,171
Sure, Becky, go home.

930
01:04:05,238 --> 01:04:07,923
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

931
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:10,800
They'll never fit in that trunk.

932
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:14,483
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

933
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:16,785
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

934
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:18,895
You'll catch cold if you don't.

935
01:04:26,806 --> 01:04:28,331
Yeesh.

936
01:04:30,163 --> 01:04:32,656
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

937
01:04:32,723 --> 01:04:36,339
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

938
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,928
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

939
01:04:41,364 --> 01:04:42,822
Hey, Mom?

940
01:04:46,552 --> 01:04:48,202
<i>Dizzy dames.</i>

941
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:52,134
<i>What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

942
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:54,800
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,</i>

943
01:04:54,867 --> 01:04:56,459
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

944
01:04:56,536 --> 01:05:01,235
<i>There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,</i>

945
01:05:01,302 --> 01:05:05,042
<i>out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.</i>

946
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,972
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

947
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:12,686
<i>It'll help.</i>

948
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:40,372
It's got you smoking there, bud.

949
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:47,661
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

950
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:49,838
You're dead.

951
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:53,962
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

952
01:05:54,038 --> 01:05:58,766
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

953
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,164
It's got you hearing things.

954
01:06:01,231 --> 01:06:04,271
It's got your nerves shot.

955
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:06,822
It's got you smoking.

956
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:10,677
You know it's true.

957
01:06:10,735 --> 01:06:14,254
Nobody ever really quits.

958
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:20,363
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

959
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:25,139
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

960
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:29,004
Will you look at that?

961
01:06:30,481 --> 01:06:33,799
Ooh, those hookers let you down.

962
01:06:35,094 --> 01:06:40,014
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

963
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:44,137
You sucker for the babes, you.

964
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:47,081
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

965
01:06:47,149 --> 01:06:50,150
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

966
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,555
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

967
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:57,516
Watch it!

968
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,875
Ah, this is great.

969
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:03,183
Just like being in a buddy movie.

970
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,514
Shut up!

971
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,332
Boy, you're screwed.

972
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:14,375
It's over.

973
01:07:14,452 --> 01:07:16,868
You're flushed.

974
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:20,388
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

975
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,697
Sure, he's an asshole.

976
01:07:23,764 --> 01:07:26,276
Sure, he's dead.

977
01:07:26,353 --> 01:07:29,834
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

978
01:07:29,901 --> 01:07:33,795
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

979
01:07:33,872 --> 01:07:37,190
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

980
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:39,405
Not in this heap.

981
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,889
Pull over!

982
01:07:43,347 --> 01:07:46,723
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

983
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,168
Tough call.

984
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:52,294
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

985
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,428
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

986
01:07:56,495 --> 01:07:58,701
My hand moves all on its own,

987
01:07:58,768 --> 01:08:02,633
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

988
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:09,384
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

989
01:08:10,698 --> 01:08:13,489
Whatever you say.

990
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:23,683
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

991
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:27,816
I'm the designated driver.

992
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,428
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

993
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:43,525
I'll let you off with a warning.

994
01:08:50,986 --> 01:08:52,415
What next?

995
01:08:56,491 --> 01:09:01,037
<i>The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

996
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,952
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

997
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,146
<i>A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.</i>

998
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:10,445
<i>Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

999
01:09:10,512 --> 01:09:14,568
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i>

1000
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,553
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1001
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:31,207
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

1002
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,864
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1003
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:36,204
Not tonight.

1004
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:42,917
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1005
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:45,161
Your cause is lost.

1006
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:46,916
We know everything.

1007
01:09:46,993 --> 01:09:50,886
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1008
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:55,748
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1009
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,856
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1010
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:02,663
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1011
01:10:02,759 --> 01:10:07,142
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1012
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:12,004
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1013
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:16,300
by facilitating the process of transition,

1014
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:21,479
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1015
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,481
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1016
01:10:24,557 --> 01:10:29,477
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1017
01:10:29,544 --> 01:10:31,491
I serve a new master now,

1018
01:10:31,596 --> 01:10:36,228
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1019
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:41,513
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1020
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,994
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1021
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:47,717
You don't know him.

1022
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,921
My man will find a way.

1023
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:53,922
He always finds a way.

1024
01:10:55,342 --> 01:10:57,279
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1025
01:10:57,356 --> 01:11:00,587
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1026
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:02,851
This is a fine, grand country.

1027
01:11:02,956 --> 01:11:05,219
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1028
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:08,384
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1029
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:11,942
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1030
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:14,531
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1031
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:16,871
without shite to show for it.

1032
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:20,640
Yeesh.

1033
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:23,201
You find something, Murphy?

1034
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:26,433
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1035
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,418
It's all bent up.

1036
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,238
What's this stuck in it?

1037
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:33,280
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1038
01:11:42,122 --> 01:11:45,632
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1039
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:49,123
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

1040
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:51,099
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

1041
01:11:51,175 --> 01:11:53,352
<i>And if they were hired
by who I think they were,</i>

1042
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,229
<i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i>

1043
01:11:56,297 --> 01:11:59,644
<i>And everything seemed
to be going so well.</i>

1044
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:16,100
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1045
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,373
You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1046
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,538
Lend me your knife.

1047
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:24,578
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1048
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:27,551
I'm at the bone, all right?

1049
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,713
There we go.

1050
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:38,532
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1051
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:42,914
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1052
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,763
use your imagination, OK?

1053
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,415
<i>Silence, now.</i>

1054
01:12:57,482 --> 01:12:59,783
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

1055
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,744
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i>

1056
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:09,124
<i>Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs.</i>

1057
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:12,701
<i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i>

1058
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:17,794
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

1059
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:21,409
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

1060
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:23,298
<i>You're a saint.</i>

1061
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:25,504
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

1062
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,547
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

1063
01:13:27,624 --> 01:13:29,762
<i>You're God.</i>

1064
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:35,804
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

1065
01:13:36,226 --> 01:13:39,103
Dwight, they got Gail!

1066
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,198
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1067
01:13:43,303 --> 01:13:46,046
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1068
01:13:46,113 --> 01:13:48,453
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1069
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,429
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1070
01:13:50,534 --> 01:13:54,524
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1071
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:59,616
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1072
01:14:07,365 --> 01:14:10,328
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

1073
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,888
<i>We talk.</i>

1074
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:29,221
<i>Stay smart.
Stay cool.</i>

1075
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:32,597
<i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i>

1076
01:14:32,674 --> 01:14:35,714
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

1077
01:14:35,781 --> 01:14:39,128
<i>Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.</i>

1078
01:14:39,204 --> 01:14:41,592
There they are.
What do we do?

1079
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:43,741
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1080
01:14:51,652 --> 01:14:53,724
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1081
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:57,474
<i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i>

1082
01:15:02,528 --> 01:15:04,637
Get the head!
Get the head!

1083
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,186
I got it!
I got it!

1084
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:17,469
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1085
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:23,933
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

1086
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,546
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.</i>

1087
01:15:31,202 --> 01:15:35,508
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1088
01:15:40,064 --> 01:15:42,173
Brave lad.

1089
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,952
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1090
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:49,634
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1091
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:51,898
You got the drop on me, love.

1092
01:15:52,003 --> 01:15:54,372
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1093
01:16:01,085 --> 01:16:03,809
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1094
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:08,700
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1095
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:11,289
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1096
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,329
It's my preference to blow things up.

1097
01:16:14,406 --> 01:16:16,707
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1098
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:20,380
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1099
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:24,245
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1100
01:16:24,322 --> 01:16:29,856
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1101
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:33,241
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1102
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:35,869
You killed me mates.

1103
01:16:35,936 --> 01:16:40,213
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1104
01:16:42,112 --> 01:16:44,183
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

1105
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,645
<i>You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.</i>

1106
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:50,398
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

1107
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,162
<i>He feels it.</i>

1108
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:58,492
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.</i>

1109
01:16:58,588 --> 01:17:02,865
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.</i>

1110
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:07,737
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.</i>

1111
01:17:07,804 --> 01:17:11,601
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

1112
01:17:21,508 --> 01:17:24,251
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1113
01:17:24,318 --> 01:17:26,361
What, are you kidding me, man?

1114
01:17:26,466 --> 01:17:29,756
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1115
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:31,232
I mean, the man's an artist.

1116
01:17:31,328 --> 01:17:36,219
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1117
01:17:36,286 --> 01:17:38,137
Your skin is perfect.

1118
01:17:38,205 --> 01:17:41,177
Your nerves, responsive.

1119
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:42,491
Beautiful.

1120
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,522
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1121
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:52,340
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1122
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:56,637
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1123
01:17:56,704 --> 01:17:58,804
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1124
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,758
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1125
01:18:01,854 --> 01:18:03,705
We gotta cut a deal.

1126
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:07,224
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

1127
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:10,197
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1128
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:12,374
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1129
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:14,484
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1130
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:17,083
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1131
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,538
It wasn't your mom!

1132
01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:22,645
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1133
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:25,302
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1134
01:18:25,378 --> 01:18:29,119
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1135
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:31,833
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1136
01:18:31,938 --> 01:18:33,942
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1137
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:38,584
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1138
01:18:38,622 --> 01:18:40,473
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1139
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,171
Your neck.

1140
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,199
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1141
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:54,034
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1142
01:18:55,549 --> 01:18:58,896
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1143
01:18:58,973 --> 01:19:02,838
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1144
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:05,561
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1145
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,014
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1146
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,878
Hey.

1147
01:19:13,339 --> 01:19:15,094
Hey.

1148
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:17,463
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1149
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:21,049
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1150
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:23,898
There's something wrapped around it.

1151
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:25,624
Some kind of note.

1152
01:19:25,691 --> 01:19:27,868
Give it to me.

1153
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:30,716
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1154
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:34,677
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1155
01:19:34,782 --> 01:19:36,470
And bring the women.

1156
01:19:36,576 --> 01:19:39,673
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1157
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,291
McCarthy, you fool.

1158
01:19:43,903 --> 01:19:44,910
Hey.

1159
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,355
Guys?

1160
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,903
Aw.

1161
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:57,722
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

1162
01:19:57,789 --> 01:20:01,616
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

1163
01:20:01,692 --> 01:20:07,063
<i>But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.</i>

1164
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:09,681
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

1165
01:20:09,786 --> 01:20:14,706
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

1166
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:21,199
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1167
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:25,744
Just give me the woman.

1168
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,730
Shut up.

1169
01:20:27,806 --> 01:20:30,674
Dwight, don't do this.

1170
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:34,874
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1171
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:38,317
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1172
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:40,120
She's all yours.

1173
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:53,306
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1174
01:20:53,374 --> 01:20:57,018
Dwight, what have you done?

1175
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,022
Exactly what I had to.

1176
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:02,801
Every step of the way.

1177
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:08,142
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1178
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:10,521
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1179
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:24,561
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

1180
01:21:24,637 --> 01:21:29,174
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good.

1181
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:33,106
<i>But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

1182
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:35,963
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1183
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:41,075
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

1184
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:47,472
<i>No escape, no surrender, no mercy.</i>

1185
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:51,317
<i>We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

1186
01:21:51,384 --> 01:21:53,485
<i>Every last one.</i>

1187
01:21:53,561 --> 01:21:57,618
<i>Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,</i>

1188
01:21:57,685 --> 01:22:00,754
<i>not because it'll make
the world a better place.</i>

1189
01:22:01,847 --> 01:22:03,602
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1190
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,534
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,</i>

1191
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:11,763
<i>he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

1192
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:14,899
<i>The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing</i>

1193
01:22:14,995 --> 01:22:20,145
<i>with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

1194
01:22:20,212 --> 01:22:22,456
<i>and so am I.</i>

1195
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:29,112
<i>The fire, baby.</i>

1196
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:31,855
<i>It'll burn us both.</i>

1197
01:22:31,932 --> 01:22:35,720
<i>There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,</i>

1198
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:39,987
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

1199
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:42,836
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

1200
01:22:42,903 --> 01:22:44,974
<i>Always...</i>

1201
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:46,672
<i>and never.</i>

1202
01:22:59,638 --> 01:23:02,572
Evenin', officer.

1203
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:07,463
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

1204
01:23:07,578 --> 01:23:10,868
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1205
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:14,416
You know who I am and what I can do.

1206
01:23:14,483 --> 01:23:17,101
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1207
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:19,758
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1208
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:22,030
You blew my son's ear off.

1209
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:28,398
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1210
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:34,095
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1211
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,984
My boy.

1212
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:38,669
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1213
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:42,803
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

1214
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:46,581
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1215
01:23:47,348 --> 01:23:51,338
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

1216
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:54,771
Power comes from lying.

1217
01:23:54,838 --> 01:23:59,442
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1218
01:23:59,509 --> 01:24:02,415
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1219
01:24:02,482 --> 01:24:04,975
you've got 'em by the balls.

1220
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:10,317
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1221
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:16,263
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1222
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:19,571
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

1223
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,353
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1224
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:26,217
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1225
01:24:29,555 --> 01:24:32,854
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1226
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:35,846
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1227
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,020
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1228
01:24:40,852 --> 01:24:44,333
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1229
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:50,701
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1230
01:24:50,768 --> 01:24:53,070
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1231
01:24:53,137 --> 01:24:56,781
disgraced, destroyed...

1232
01:24:56,848 --> 01:24:58,795
alone.

1233
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:01,557
Your wife?

1234
01:25:01,615 --> 01:25:03,792
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1235
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:06,822
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1236
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:10,351
They won't let me testify.

1237
01:25:10,447 --> 01:25:14,609
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1238
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,390
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1239
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:19,913
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1240
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,348
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1241
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:26,415
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1242
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:30,893
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

1243
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:33,166
They got it all backwards.

1244
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:36,743
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1245
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:40,263
But you'll always remember things right.

1246
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,373
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1247
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:48,741
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1248
01:25:48,846 --> 01:25:50,755
Don't visit me.

1249
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:52,557
Don't write me.

1250
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,734
Don't even say my name.

1251
01:25:55,156 --> 01:25:59,079
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1252
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:01,064
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

1253
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,475
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1254
01:26:05,552 --> 01:26:09,772
I'll write you every week... for forever.

1255
01:26:09,839 --> 01:26:12,524
Sure, kid.

1256
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,634
Now, run on home.

1257
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:16,974
It's not safe for you here.

1258
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:23,466
Bye, Nancy.

1259
01:26:25,711 --> 01:26:27,945
I love you.

1260
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,900
John Hartigan.

1261
01:26:38,705 --> 01:26:40,642
Mr. Law and Order.

1262
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:44,977
Mr. By the Book.

1263
01:26:45,073 --> 01:26:47,145
Mr. High and Mighty.

1264
01:26:49,485 --> 01:26:52,688
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1265
01:26:52,755 --> 01:26:54,826
without it catching up with you.

1266
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:58,029
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1267
01:26:58,097 --> 01:27:00,264
It's catching up with you but good.

1268
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:06,862
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1269
01:27:06,929 --> 01:27:13,067
Ohh, he's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1270
01:27:13,134 --> 01:27:16,366
He's the picture of health.

1271
01:27:16,462 --> 01:27:19,694
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1272
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:21,966
I rented her out of Old Town.

1273
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:26,503
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1274
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:27,884
You hear me, Hartigan?

1275
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:31,499
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1276
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:34,319
you might just get some of Tammy.

1277
01:27:34,386 --> 01:27:37,924
You see that?
She flinched.

1278
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:40,236
You make her sick.

1279
01:27:40,303 --> 01:27:42,988
She heard about you and that little girl.

1280
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:47,246
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

1281
01:27:47,313 --> 01:27:51,533
<i>You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs.</i>

1282
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,508
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

1283
01:27:53,614 --> 01:27:56,913
<i>They want a confession.
They won't get it.</i>

1284
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:03,616
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i>

1285
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:06,656
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia."
Just like she promised.</i>

1286
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:10,349
<i>She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.</i>

1287
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,283
<i>At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two</i>

1288
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,458
<i>before her young mind
moves on to better things.</i>

1289
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:19,661
<i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i>

1290
01:28:19,757 --> 01:28:21,483
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

1291
01:28:22,058 --> 01:28:25,770
<i>I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

1292
01:28:25,837 --> 01:28:30,095
<i>She's the only friend I've got -
the daughter I never had.</i>

1293
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:32,099
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

1294
01:28:32,176 --> 01:28:34,660
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1295
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:38,783
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

1296
01:28:42,994 --> 01:28:45,861
<i>Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,</i>

1297
01:28:45,928 --> 01:28:47,875
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

1298
01:28:47,952 --> 01:28:51,395
<i>only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

1299
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:54,530
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.</i>

1300
01:28:55,115 --> 01:28:57,455
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

1301
01:28:57,513 --> 01:28:59,306
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1302
01:28:59,374 --> 01:29:01,675
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1303
01:29:01,742 --> 01:29:04,159
<i>Nothing.</i>

1304
01:29:04,236 --> 01:29:07,784
<i>Two months now -
not a word from Nancy.</i>

1305
01:29:07,851 --> 01:29:11,150
<i>Did they find her?
Did they get to her?</i>

1306
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:14,526
<i>Of course!
Stupid old man.</i>

1307
01:29:14,603 --> 01:29:18,084
<i>Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

1308
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:20,549
<i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i>

1309
01:29:20,616 --> 01:29:24,164
<i>She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.</i>

1310
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:27,204
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

1311
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:29,199
<i>You're alone.</i>

1312
01:29:29,256 --> 01:29:31,558
<i>You're all alone.</i>

1313
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:42,472
<i>This guy smells awful -
like bad food.</i>

1314
01:29:42,539 --> 01:29:45,799
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.</i>

1315
01:29:45,867 --> 01:29:47,976
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

1316
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:01,374
<i>Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.</i>

1317
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,165
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

1318
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,368
<i>The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,</i>

1319
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,804
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

1320
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,808
<i>There's something soft,</i>

1321
01:30:11,885 --> 01:30:15,654
<i>something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone</i>

1322
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:19,653
<i>that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

1323
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,762
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1324
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,556
<i>She was so careful.</i>

1325
01:30:23,623 --> 01:30:26,375
<i>She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.</i>

1326
01:30:31,276 --> 01:30:34,565
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.</i>

1327
01:30:34,661 --> 01:30:39,552
<i>Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

1328
01:30:39,629 --> 01:30:42,113
<i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i>

1329
01:30:42,189 --> 01:30:45,728
<i>You got me, Roark.
You beat me.</i>

1330
01:30:46,342 --> 01:30:49,794
<i>I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.</i>

1331
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:53,161
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted.
Wretched child molester.</i>

1332
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:56,488
<i>I agree to everything they want from me.</i>

1333
01:30:56,556 --> 01:30:58,531
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1334
01:31:09,828 --> 01:31:12,418
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1335
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:19,361
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1336
01:31:19,428 --> 01:31:23,178
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1337
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:25,662
Christ.

1338
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:28,452
Eight years.

1339
01:31:28,519 --> 01:31:31,684
Yeah.
Eight years.

1340
01:31:32,998 --> 01:31:35,846
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1341
01:31:37,611 --> 01:31:39,711
you made me hate myself.

1342
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:45,216
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

1343
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,282
She got remarried four years ago.

1344
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:55,525
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

1345
01:31:55,592 --> 01:31:57,530
Don't be.

1346
01:31:57,606 --> 01:31:59,994
I'm glad.

1347
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:03,140
Eileen always wanted kids.

1348
01:32:03,207 --> 01:32:05,058
She'll make a good mother.

1349
01:32:06,947 --> 01:32:11,109
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

1350
01:32:21,515 --> 01:32:24,737
<i>Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

1351
01:32:24,804 --> 01:32:28,832
<i>then I go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

1352
01:32:28,899 --> 01:32:30,242
<i>Nancy.</i>

1353
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:33,627
<i>How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?</i>

1354
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,360
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1355
01:32:36,456 --> 01:32:39,458
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

1356
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:45,087
<i>Not a sound.</i>

1357
01:32:45,154 --> 01:32:47,772
<i>No sign of life.</i>

1358
01:32:47,849 --> 01:32:51,426
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,</i>

1359
01:32:51,493 --> 01:32:55,109
<i>like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1360
01:32:55,176 --> 01:32:57,861
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1361
01:32:57,928 --> 01:33:00,547
<i>It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.</i>

1362
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,754
<i>No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

1363
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:10,559
<i>Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

1364
01:33:11,268 --> 01:33:15,680
<i>It's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there.</i>

1365
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:24,129
<i>A dead end.</i>

1366
01:33:24,196 --> 01:33:27,744
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this.</i>

1367
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:31,590
<i>But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1368
01:33:31,657 --> 01:33:34,592
<i>or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.</i>

1369
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:39,483
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1370
01:33:39,588 --> 01:33:42,753
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1371
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:45,601
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1372
01:33:45,668 --> 01:33:48,037
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1373
01:33:48,133 --> 01:33:51,230
She's just warming up.

1374
01:33:58,979 --> 01:34:01,799
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1375
01:34:01,856 --> 01:34:03,678
<i>She grew up.</i>

1376
01:34:03,746 --> 01:34:06,565
<i>She filled out.</i>

1377
01:34:06,632 --> 01:34:10,104
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

1378
01:34:11,974 --> 01:34:14,909
<i>And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

1379
01:34:15,014 --> 01:34:18,620
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

1380
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:24,355
<i>How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.</i>

1381
01:34:28,354 --> 01:34:30,627
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1382
01:34:30,694 --> 01:34:33,111
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

1383
01:34:33,187 --> 01:34:35,355
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

1384
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,941
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

1385
01:34:46,911 --> 01:34:49,788
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

1386
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:52,310
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

1387
01:34:53,413 --> 01:34:55,034
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

1388
01:34:55,110 --> 01:35:00,097
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him.</i>

1389
01:35:00,164 --> 01:35:03,962
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.</i>

1390
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:06,878
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

1391
01:35:07,587 --> 01:35:10,272
<i>No, Nancy.
Don't notice me.</i>

1392
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,571
<i>Don't recognize me.</i>

1393
01:35:22,912 --> 01:35:24,821
There's no time to explain.

1394
01:35:24,926 --> 01:35:27,803
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1395
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:30,143
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1396
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:33,922
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1397
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:40,577
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1398
01:35:40,644 --> 01:35:42,946
Kept me going.

1399
01:35:44,126 --> 01:35:46,370
Kept me from killing myself.

1400
01:35:47,971 --> 01:35:49,947
Hurry up, will you?

1401
01:35:55,394 --> 01:35:58,108
Maybe I should drive.
Not a chance.

1402
01:35:58,885 --> 01:36:01,532
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1403
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:10,614
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1404
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:13,558
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1405
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,895
It's loaded and it works.

1406
01:36:18,813 --> 01:36:21,335
Yeah, this'll do.

1407
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:24,759
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1408
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:33,783
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1409
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,315
You've never been far from my thoughts.

1410
01:36:36,382 --> 01:36:39,864
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

1411
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:42,616
What are you talking about?

1412
01:36:42,683 --> 01:36:47,258
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

1413
01:36:49,952 --> 01:36:51,803
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

1414
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:53,558
What are you doing?

1415
01:36:53,664 --> 01:36:55,965
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

1416
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,280
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1417
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,538
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

1418
01:37:08,605 --> 01:37:11,386
<i>He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

1419
01:37:11,454 --> 01:37:14,321
<i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i>

1420
01:37:18,205 --> 01:37:20,181
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

1421
01:37:20,257 --> 01:37:23,422
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i>

1422
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,885
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1423
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,956
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1424
01:37:36,033 --> 01:37:38,996
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1425
01:37:45,374 --> 01:37:48,126
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1426
01:37:48,193 --> 01:37:52,279
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1427
01:37:52,346 --> 01:37:54,456
No!
Let me stay close.

1428
01:37:54,523 --> 01:37:56,949
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1429
01:37:57,055 --> 01:38:00,085
Please?
Let me stay close.

1430
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,955
<i>The stink - I almost gag.</i>

1431
01:38:13,022 --> 01:38:14,873
<i>His blood smells
even worse than he does.</i>

1432
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,808
<i>- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.</i>

1433
01:38:17,885 --> 01:38:22,191
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

1434
01:38:22,267 --> 01:38:24,243
We're out of time.

1435
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,597
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.</i>

1436
01:38:29,115 --> 01:38:31,867
<i>There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,</i>

1437
01:38:31,934 --> 01:38:35,540
<i>get Nancy calmed down and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

1438
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:39,031
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.</i>

1439
01:38:39,769 --> 01:38:41,716
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1440
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:45,562
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1441
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:47,796
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1442
01:38:47,873 --> 01:38:51,479
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1443
01:38:51,546 --> 01:38:55,027
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1444
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,585
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1445
01:38:58,652 --> 01:39:01,107
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1446
01:39:02,297 --> 01:39:05,145
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

1447
01:39:05,787 --> 01:39:07,993
<i>I've never been all that good with people.</i>

1448
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,292
<i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,</i>

1449
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:15,099
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

1450
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,948
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1451
01:39:18,015 --> 01:39:19,894
All these years.

1452
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:23,510
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1453
01:39:23,577 --> 01:39:26,675
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1454
01:39:26,751 --> 01:39:29,811
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1455
01:39:30,233 --> 01:39:32,247
Eight years.

1456
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:35,795
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1457
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,972
It wasn't just gratitude.

1458
01:39:38,077 --> 01:39:41,041
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1459
01:39:41,117 --> 01:39:43,381
Even thought I did once or twice.

1460
01:39:43,448 --> 01:39:47,313
But I was already in love... with you.

1461
01:39:47,389 --> 01:39:49,969
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

1462
01:39:50,046 --> 01:39:52,280
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1463
01:39:52,347 --> 01:39:54,937
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1464
01:39:55,608 --> 01:39:57,267
No.

1465
01:40:31,034 --> 01:40:34,103
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1466
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,587
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1467
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:39,473
I love you.

1468
01:40:43,933 --> 01:40:46,292
I love you, too.

1469
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:48,181
With all my heart.

1470
01:40:49,399 --> 01:40:52,468
<i>Cold shower - it helps.</i>

1471
01:40:52,535 --> 01:40:53,782
No, Nancy.

1472
01:40:57,177 --> 01:40:59,344
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

1473
01:40:59,421 --> 01:41:03,094
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1474
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:06,834
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1475
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:10,737
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

1476
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:16,060
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

1477
01:41:16,156 --> 01:41:18,486
<i>I've been suckered
into betraying the only friend I've got,</i>

1478
01:41:18,553 --> 01:41:22,102
<i>and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

1479
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:26,197
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.</i>

1480
01:41:26,264 --> 01:41:28,172
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

1481
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,138
Klump, it's me.

1482
01:41:30,196 --> 01:41:32,948
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1483
01:41:33,015 --> 01:41:34,962
I want you to set me up for a party.

1484
01:41:35,029 --> 01:41:37,369
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

1485
01:41:37,436 --> 01:41:40,179
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1486
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:42,673
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1487
01:41:42,778 --> 01:41:45,396
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1488
01:41:47,228 --> 01:41:52,522
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1489
01:41:53,049 --> 01:41:56,175
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

1490
01:41:56,243 --> 01:41:58,899
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1491
01:41:58,966 --> 01:42:02,035
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1492
01:42:02,102 --> 01:42:06,293
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1493
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,187
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1494
01:42:10,263 --> 01:42:12,364
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

1495
01:42:12,469 --> 01:42:14,128
I've been having the time of my life.

1496
01:42:14,234 --> 01:42:17,581
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1497
01:42:17,686 --> 01:42:19,691
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

1498
01:42:19,796 --> 01:42:21,685
She left not a clue.

1499
01:42:22,999 --> 01:42:26,126
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1500
01:42:28,696 --> 01:42:32,522
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1501
01:42:32,599 --> 01:42:35,668
Nancy, don't scream.

1502
01:42:35,735 --> 01:42:38,036
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

1503
01:42:38,104 --> 01:42:42,256
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1504
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:45,526
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1505
01:42:45,622 --> 01:42:48,173
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1506
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:50,964
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

1507
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:54,062
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1508
01:42:54,138 --> 01:42:56,306
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1509
01:42:56,373 --> 01:43:00,199
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1510
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:02,865
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1511
01:43:11,544 --> 01:43:15,026
<i>This is it.
No way to fight it now.</i>

1512
01:43:15,093 --> 01:43:17,068
<i>No hope left.</i>

1513
01:43:17,174 --> 01:43:18,833
<i>No chance.</i>

1514
01:43:18,929 --> 01:43:22,573
<i>This is it.
This is the end.</i>

1515
01:43:25,201 --> 01:43:26,256
<i>No.</i>

1516
01:43:26,869 --> 01:43:30,964
<i>Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

1517
01:43:31,032 --> 01:43:34,733
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm.
The window.</i>

1518
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:37,361
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!</i>

1519
01:43:37,428 --> 01:43:40,113
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

1520
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:41,322
<i>No alarm.</i>

1521
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:44,045
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

1522
01:43:44,113 --> 01:43:46,836
<i>You can do it.
You can do it.</i>

1523
01:43:46,903 --> 01:43:48,524
It is inclement upon me

1524
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:52,782
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1525
01:43:52,849 --> 01:43:59,342
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

1526
01:43:59,409 --> 01:44:04,846
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

1527
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:10,831
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1528
01:44:10,898 --> 01:44:13,353
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1529
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:18,129
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1530
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:24,688
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1531
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:32,552
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1532
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:34,250
In plain English, creep!

1533
01:44:34,327 --> 01:44:37,932
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

1534
01:44:39,218 --> 01:44:41,222
The farm!

1535
01:44:42,037 --> 01:44:44,885
<i>That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force</i>

1536
01:44:44,943 --> 01:44:48,875
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.</i>

1537
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:51,148
<i>Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.</i>

1538
01:44:51,215 --> 01:44:54,217
<i>Once things get loud,
I'll probably have use for the cannons.</i>

1539
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:57,170
<i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

1540
01:44:57,237 --> 01:44:59,376
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

1541
01:44:59,923 --> 01:45:03,155
<i>Nancy's car - six miles from the farm.</i>

1542
01:45:03,222 --> 01:45:06,348
<i>"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running", she told me.</i>

1543
01:45:06,415 --> 01:45:09,762
<i>Good girl.
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

1544
01:45:09,839 --> 01:45:12,112
<i>and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.</i>

1545
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:15,948
<i>You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

1546
01:45:16,015 --> 01:45:18,508
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i>

1547
01:45:18,576 --> 01:45:22,373
<i>But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

1548
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:24,589
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

1549
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:26,574
<i>Don't scream.</i>

1550
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,014
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods.</i>

1551
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,888
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

1552
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:39,242
<i>My heart.
Can't be my heart.</i>

1553
01:45:39,309 --> 01:45:42,033
<i>I was cured.</i>

1554
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,996
<i>Bad cough - blood in it.</i>

1555
01:45:45,485 --> 01:45:47,049
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

1556
01:45:47,125 --> 01:45:50,156
<i>I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.</i>

1557
01:45:54,644 --> 01:45:57,003
<i>Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.</i>

1558
01:46:02,738 --> 01:46:05,702
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

1559
01:46:16,845 --> 01:46:19,751
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

1560
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,770
Do you think I'm tired?

1561
01:46:30,828 --> 01:46:32,870
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1562
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:35,278
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1563
01:46:35,345 --> 01:46:37,234
You'll crack!

1564
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:40,226
You'll cry and beg!

1565
01:46:40,303 --> 01:46:41,962
You'll scream!

1566
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:46,575
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1567
01:46:46,642 --> 01:46:48,071
You'll scream!

1568
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:55,906
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1569
01:46:56,491 --> 01:46:58,888
That was foreplay.

1570
01:46:59,915 --> 01:47:02,734
Hartigan was right about you.

1571
01:47:02,801 --> 01:47:05,170
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1572
01:47:06,762 --> 01:47:08,459
You're pathetic!

1573
01:47:09,706 --> 01:47:11,720
You're pathetic.

1574
01:47:14,003 --> 01:47:16,966
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1575
01:47:18,385 --> 01:47:20,744
It brings out the worst in me.

1576
01:47:27,026 --> 01:47:28,714
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1577
01:47:28,781 --> 01:47:30,852
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

1578
01:47:32,425 --> 01:47:35,216
Damn!
It can't be!

1579
01:47:35,695 --> 01:47:39,042
<i>Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1580
01:47:39,148 --> 01:47:40,395
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1581
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:44,490
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

1582
01:47:49,035 --> 01:47:50,790
Good advice.

1583
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:02,759
Give it up, Junior.

1584
01:48:02,826 --> 01:48:04,734
It's over.
Let her go.

1585
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,470
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1586
01:48:06,576 --> 01:48:11,304
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

1587
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:14,440
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1588
01:48:14,507 --> 01:48:17,163
You can't even lift that cannon!

1589
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:19,494
Sure, I can.

1590
01:48:26,092 --> 01:48:28,643
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1591
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,529
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1592
01:48:32,201 --> 01:48:34,886
I'm taking no chances with you.

1593
01:48:37,322 --> 01:48:40,669
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1594
01:48:43,786 --> 01:48:46,126
Here it comes.

1595
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,415
It's gonna hurt.

1596
01:48:49,482 --> 01:48:51,429
You're right about that.

1597
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:56,972
Sucker.

1598
01:49:00,108 --> 01:49:01,834
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

1599
01:49:03,695 --> 01:49:04,999
<i>Both of them.</i>

1600
01:49:16,363 --> 01:49:19,873
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1601
01:49:20,871 --> 01:49:24,668
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

1602
01:49:24,745 --> 01:49:25,896
<i>so I stop.</i>

1603
01:49:27,373 --> 01:49:29,761
So long, Junior.

1604
01:49:29,837 --> 01:49:32,254
Been a pleasure.

1605
01:49:37,423 --> 01:49:40,770
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1606
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:43,647
I didn't scream.

1607
01:49:43,753 --> 01:49:45,795
I know it, baby.

1608
01:49:45,901 --> 01:49:48,135
You grew up strong.

1609
01:49:59,116 --> 01:50:02,338
<i>By the time I get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.</i>

1610
01:50:02,406 --> 01:50:06,184
<i>Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.</i>

1611
01:50:06,251 --> 01:50:08,620
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1612
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:11,909
And for all the little things.

1613
01:50:12,590 --> 01:50:15,899
Like saving my life, twice.

1614
01:50:16,906 --> 01:50:19,773
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1615
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:24,635
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1616
01:50:24,712 --> 01:50:27,330
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1617
01:50:27,397 --> 01:50:29,642
I'm gonna clear my name.

1618
01:50:29,709 --> 01:50:33,602
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1619
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:37,151
I can't lose you, not again.

1620
01:50:39,433 --> 01:50:42,301
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1621
01:50:54,509 --> 01:50:58,153
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

1622
01:50:59,496 --> 01:51:03,802
<i>Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

1623
01:51:03,878 --> 01:51:07,331
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure.</i>

1624
01:51:07,398 --> 01:51:10,812
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off
that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

1625
01:51:10,889 --> 01:51:14,533
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

1626
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,605
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

1627
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,714
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

1628
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,505
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

1629
01:51:21,706 --> 01:51:24,286
<i>He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.</i>

1630
01:51:24,363 --> 01:51:27,806
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.</i>

1631
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:30,270
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

1632
01:51:30,347 --> 01:51:32,447
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

1633
01:51:32,524 --> 01:51:35,008
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

1634
01:51:35,075 --> 01:51:37,569
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

1635
01:51:38,182 --> 01:51:40,733
<i>An old man dies,</i>

1636
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,949
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

1637
01:51:44,004 --> 01:51:46,181
<i>Fair trade.</i>

1638
01:51:49,029 --> 01:51:51,848
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1639
01:51:58,533 --> 01:52:00,508
Yes.

1640
01:52:00,585 --> 01:52:02,848
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1641
01:52:02,915 --> 01:52:07,873
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1642
01:52:07,941 --> 01:52:11,393
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1643
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:13,733
It should be right as rain in no time.

1644
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:19,228
Uh-huh.

1645
01:52:27,524 --> 01:52:29,221
Mm-hm.

1646
01:52:32,194 --> 01:52:35,397
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1647
01:52:35,464 --> 01:52:39,770
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

1648
01:52:39,847 --> 01:52:41,468
Becky.

1649
01:52:43,434 --> 01:52:45,985
Care for a smoke?

1650
01:52:47,941 --> 01:52:50,080
Love you, too, Mom.

1651
01:52:52,295 --> 01:52:53,225
<i>Anything.</i>
