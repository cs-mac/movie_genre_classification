1
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,287
Shit.

2
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,876
Hi, Daddy.

3
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:02,507
- Hi, Daddy.
- Merry Christmas.

4
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,968
Christina, it's time to go in.
We're going in again.

5
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,848
- Come on, kids. Come on.
- What?

6
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:23,605
If you want a Slurpee,
you're out of luck.

7
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,734
No, no.
You're the one that's out of luck.

8
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:39,584
We don't carry no more than $50 cash.
It's the store policy.

9
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,212
It's okay.

10
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,916
Just take out what's ever there.

11
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,521
- Is there anything else?
- No, there's nothing.

12
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,104
Your wallet?

13
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,816
Oh, I forgot that. Here you are.

14
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:10,902
Do you believe in God?

15
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:14,112
Yes. Yes, I do.

16
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,156
That's nice...

17
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,326
...because I have the instrument...

18
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,459
...of your salvation.

19
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,503
Please.

20
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:26,792
Please.

21
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:31,842
I didn't look at you.
I can't identify you.

22
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,722
No...

23
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:36,924
...but I can identify you.

24
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:40,814
You are a dead nigger.

25
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,854
No. Please, no.

26
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:50,947
Attention, all units, armed robbery
at convenience store, Foothill and Loma.

27
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:52,907
Store manager seriously wounded.

28
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:57,026
Following description of one suspect:
Male, Caucasian, 18 to 25...

29
00:06:57,205 --> 00:07:01,369
...5'10"to 6'2", medium build.
Nothing further.

30
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:06,874
This is Kimble. I'm making a stop
at the intersection of Foothill and Noble.

31
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:10,133
Possible suspect matching
the description of the stop and rob.

32
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:22,348
- Good morning.
- Is there any problem, officer?

33
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:26,389
No. You're just up
a little early this morning, aren't you?

34
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:29,687
It's the Santa Anas.
I find it difficult to sleep...

35
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:32,400
...when the winds start blowing in
from the desert.

36
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,116
- Yeah.
- Hey, by the way.

37
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,742
Merry Christmas.

38
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,947
Yeah, Merry Christmas.
You got some ID on you?

39
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:42,123
ID? Sure. Is a driver's license okay?

40
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,958
That'll be fine.

41
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,366
Wait a minute.

42
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,469
Homicide?

43
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:02,885
Yeah, that's us, all right.

44
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,981
Our day begins when yours ends.

45
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:09,564
I'm glad to see somebody's out here
crushing crime.

46
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:13,436
Personally, I was hoping to get one
full night's sleep before Christmas.

47
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,654
Fat fucking chance.

48
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,534
- You Homicide?
- Yeah. Are you the handling unit?

49
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,832
- Yup.
- What do you got?

50
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,795
Pictures of the casings and the body.

51
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:32,918
Take some overalls,
and then step out of the way.

52
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:39,127
The officer that was involved
in the shooting here...

53
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:03,240
What's his name?

54
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,914
Gary Kimble.

55
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:17,834
I'm telling you, I got it covered.

56
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:21,088
Okay.
How does 20 pounds of ice sound?

57
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:23,304
I think that ought to do it.

58
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,477
I got... I got five cases of beer
being delivered by 5:00.

59
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:32,598
Yes. Three quarts of bourbon
and the plastic glasses.

60
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,318
Okay?

61
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:38,104
I'Il... I'll be there no later than 7...

62
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,857
Plenty women. Foxes.
All shapes and sizes, okay?

63
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:45,527
Okay. Take care.

64
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:50,040
Hey, Beck,
still living in Heartbreak Hotel?

65
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,080
No, I got a suite at the Bonaventure.

66
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:58,467
We're having a party tonight.
The Lonely Guys' Christmas Eve Ball.

67
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:02,633
A little something for the bachelors,
the divorced and the disenfranchised.

68
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,882
It's gonna be over at Brubaker's place.

69
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:08,474
We're gonna have plenty of booze,
maybe even some fine women.

70
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,104
You really ought to drop by.

71
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:16,775
Homicide. Bilson.

72
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,689
Yes, I invited Eileen.

73
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:21,354
I told you I invited Eileen
and I did invite Eileen.

74
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:26,944
She's very anxious to see you.
Why else would you think she's coming?

75
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:31,250
Yes,
and she's coming for the same reason.

76
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,908
Seven o'clock.
I told you I'd be there at 7:00, okay?

77
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,547
Mr. Webly, this is Jerry Beck,
Sheriff's Homicide.

78
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:41,551
I'd like to talk to you
about one of your people.

79
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,127
A Robert "Bobby" Burns.

80
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:46,760
I need his package.

81
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,471
His package?
Come on, this is Christmas Eve day.

82
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:51,513
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

83
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:54,641
No, I'm halfway out of my office.
I got shopping to do.

84
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,892
I'm sorry, but I have a suspect...

85
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,943
...and I don't know what he looks like.

86
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,152
What makes you so sure
Burns is your guy...

87
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:03,983
...if I may be so bold as to ask.

88
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:07,492
Because I checked the parole index
and his name comes up.

89
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:10,117
He's a convicted robber,
he's recently paroled.

90
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,081
And he's at the top of my list.

91
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,495
This is Christmas Eve day.

92
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:15,826
I have a family.
Don't you have a family?

93
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,168
I used to have a family.
I don't have a family now.

94
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,958
What I do have is a dead cop
and I need that package.

95
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,840
You don't understand.
I am leaving now to do my shopping.

96
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:29,263
I am going. I told the wife
two minutes ago, "I am leaving."

97
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,058
I understand. I'll tell you what.

98
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,761
Do your shopping and I'll see you
tomorrow morning. How's that?

99
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,931
Tomorrow morning
is Christmas morning.

100
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,266
Sorry, Webly,
but you can't have it both ways.

101
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:42,112
How's your office around 8:00 sound?

102
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,690
Fuck you.

103
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,111
Have it your way. 8:30.

104
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:49,984
And fuck you.

105
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:14,843
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

106
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,970
- I'm Ed Gates.
- Nice to meet you.

107
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,945
Excuse me a second. Thanks.

108
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,243
First Christmas away from home?

109
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,545
That obvious, huh?

110
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:49,335
Lucky guess. I'm Linda.

111
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,054
Jerry Beck.

112
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:54,555
I've heard your name.

113
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:57,135
I know, you're the one working
on the murder...

114
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,847
...of the sergeant that was killed.
How's it coming?

115
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:07,235
- It's coming.
- You don't sound convinced.

116
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:15,449
Well, right now I'm not convinced
of a lot of things.

117
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:19,955
- 'Tis the season to be jolly.
- That least of all.

118
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,915
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to sound glib.

119
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:30,458
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Merry Christmas.

120
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:34,347
Linda?

121
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,144
Don't go.

122
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:42,850
Carol. Carol, come here.

123
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,651
- Good morning.
- I have to go.

124
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,365
Well, you're certainly dressed for it.

125
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,328
I was gonna fix some breakfast.

126
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:30,078
- You want a cup of coffee? It's hot.
- No, thanks.

127
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,923
Here. I'll get you an Alka-Seltzer.

128
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,002
- What?
- What?

129
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:37,424
What?

130
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,838
Oh, Alka-Seltzer.
Here, it'll fix you right up.

131
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,588
- No, thank you.
- Here you go.

132
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,851
What was that?

133
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:48,728
That is the Burbank Airport.

134
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,603
The world's quietest airport.

135
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,654
At least that's what they say
if you complain.

136
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,275
What's your hurry?

137
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:02,700
Well,
you said you had an 8:30 appointment.

138
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,541
Well...

139
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,583
...thank you for a lovely evening,
really.

140
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,209
What happened?

141
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:19,421
Nothing. It's nothing to do with you.

142
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,673
I'm the only one here.

143
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:27,226
What I mean is, it's not you, it's...
It's me.

144
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,943
Great.

145
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,327
You look like shit.

146
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,325
- Thanks. I feel like shit.
- You must be Beck.

147
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,539
Don't bust my balls, Webly.
I'm in no mood.

148
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,335
You're in no mood?
I'm in no mood.

149
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:56,204
My wife is in no mood.
Today is Christmas, Beck.

150
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:01,757
Well, judging by the weight,
Mr. Burns has kept pretty busy.

151
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:07,431
Eight arrests, five convictions
in California, two in Texas. It's all...

152
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:14,895
- Notice we're the only ones in here.
- Hey.

153
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,816
If Bobby had wanted to go the other way
he could have been anything he wanted.

154
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,729
He's extremely bright. IQ of 135.

155
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:27,736
There's John, on some scholarship
to the University of New Mexico.

156
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,990
School of Chemical Engineering.

157
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,953
Don't underestimate Bobby.
Don't underestimate his mother.

158
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,710
She's a Hells Angels' old lady,
in case you're thinking of dropping by.

159
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:40,502
Well, good luck.

160
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,758
I would give AA some thought.
Alcoholism is a disease, you know.

161
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,888
Thank you, Webly.
I'll keep that in mind.

162
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,682
- Where's your car?
- I jogged over.

163
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,887
I live 1.4 miles from here.
I jog over three times a week...

164
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,722
...approximately 4.2 miles, yeah.

165
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,017
You ought to try it sometime.
Good for the cardiovascular system.

166
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,562
Jump in. Let me drive you home.

167
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,276
It's Christmas.
Give your system a break.

168
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,827
That's my street. That's Radford.
Hang a left.

169
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,582
Hey, you gotta make a left right here.
Left.

170
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,164
Jeez, what...? You're...
You passed my street.

171
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,627
I need a little favor, Webly.

172
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,676
I need you to drop by Mom's with me.

173
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,724
You know the rules.

174
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,349
Convict gives up his right
to search and seizure...

175
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:38,021
...but only in the presence
of a parole officer. That's you.

176
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,774
This is kidnapping, Beck. Are you
aware of this? That this is kidnapping?

177
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:46,987
No, no, no, kidnapping's a felony.
This is just a little favor.

178
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,401
With you,
I can walk right in to Mom's place...

179
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,867
...and if he's there, he's mine.

180
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,031
Like it or not, that's the way it is.

181
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,615
You are a real asshole.

182
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,974
You know, in case you haven't noticed,
it's daylight.

183
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,246
What the fuck do you want, asshole?

184
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:43,712
- Sheriff's Homicide.
- Go fuck yourself.

185
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,007
You son of a bit...

186
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,273
- Do you wanna give me a hand here?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,858
- Is that all right?
- Yes. That's just lovely. Thank you.

188
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,322
This is an exciting line of duty.

189
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,859
Sheriff's Homicide.

190
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,161
Now, you assholes calm down
and cooperate...

191
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:21,250
...or I'll rip your heads off
and tear this place apart.

192
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:24,998
Go back to sleep there, Sluggo.

193
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,456
It's Christmas morning.
What's going on?

194
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,258
- All right.
- I can't believe this.

195
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,466
Now, I'm looking for Bobby Burns.

196
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,215
- Who?
- Don't lie to me, asshole.

197
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,429
- Robert "Bobby" Burns.
- Still in the joint.

198
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,888
You must be John, aren't you?

199
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,389
His brother.

200
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,400
Where is he?

201
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,478
You wouldn't tell me if you knew,
would you?

202
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:54,072
Well, no. Not really, officer.

203
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,401
Are you okay?
You don't look very good.

204
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,248
Nothing a month in Hawaii
wouldn't cure.

205
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,791
Have you seen him?

206
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:07,411
Look, he's my brother.
I don't know what you think he's done...

207
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,298
...but he's got his own life.

208
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,708
His job is to do what he wants to do...

209
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,590
...and your job is to find him,
if you think you need to.

210
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,219
Other than that,
I really can't tell you very much.

211
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:20,427
I go back to school in two days.
I'm here on Christmas break.

212
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,354
Is your mom in there?

213
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:35,109
She awake?

214
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,574
Merry Christmas, huh?

215
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,449
Yeah.

216
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:27,455
Hey, where are you...?
Where are you going? Hey.

217
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,699
Shit.

218
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,507
Fuck.

219
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,491
Well, well, what have we here, guys?

220
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:31,957
A little domestic spat
on our good Lord's birthday?

221
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,664
- Sheriff's Homicide.
- You gotta be kidding.

222
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,707
Oh, God.
Do me a favor, cuff this asshole.

223
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,755
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

224
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,879
Elliot Webly, parole officer.
What have you done now?

225
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:45,544
I got sick, Webly.
What the hell does it look like?

226
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:48,427
I don't mind helping,
but you threw up all over this guy.

227
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,435
Jesus. Son of a bitch.
You fucking threw up on me, man.

228
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:54,723
Jesus, shut him the fuck up.
My head's killing me.

229
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,807
- Shut him up.
- What do you got on him?

230
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:59,060
I don't know.
Put him through the machine.

231
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:02,071
Come on. Jesus Christ.

232
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:05,901
Oh, man, you're a real asshole.
You know that?

233
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,950
- I got him, didn't I?
- It's all over me.

234
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,527
Come on. Let me up.

235
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:13,078
Why don't you just shit on me,
while you're at it?

236
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,326
Think this will wash out of my tie?

237
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,083
70 at Roscoe and Laurel Terrace.

238
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:23,545
Check. Ellis, James. Male Caucasian.
Date of birth: 2- 12-59.

239
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:27,716
No wants or warrants.
Currently on parole for armed robbery.

240
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,092
All right. I'll take it from here.

241
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:33,640
- Have a nice day.
- Sorry, I have other plans.

242
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,436
Honey, I'm telling you the truth.

243
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:38,179
I think the man
is actually physically dangerous.

244
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:40,434
Wait, wait a minute,
he's doing something.

245
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,730
Me? I'm at a Chinese restaurant.

246
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:48,071
Honey, sweetie, I don't think
the Chinese celebrate Christmas.

247
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:54,571
How long is your tail, parolee?

248
00:25:54,749 --> 00:25:58,533
I got three more years,
if you violate me.

249
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:02,208
Shit. You're bought and paid for.

250
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:06,171
When Bobby got out of the joint,
he called me.

251
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,882
We hung out together. No big deal.

252
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:10,882
How long ago was that?

253
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:12,884
I don't know. A month ago.

254
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,728
He was waiting for some guys
to show up.

255
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:18,054
He was doing a hell of a lot
more than that.

256
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,891
He was capering, wasn't he?

257
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:23,186
You know,
I don't have to tell you shit.

258
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,651
Not without a P.O. I don't.

259
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:29,606
I got a P.O.
He's on the phone lying to his wife.

260
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:33,741
Now keep talking.
When did these guys show up?

261
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:36,997
- Two days ago.
- Who were they?

262
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,953
I don't know,
I never seen them before.

263
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:46,044
Damn you, you better come up
with something better.

264
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:49,384
- That's all I know, I swear to God.
- What is going on here?

265
00:26:49,553 --> 00:26:52,424
I'll be finished in a minute.
Keep an eye out for the cops.

266
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:55,599
I will not.
I will not be a party to this, Beck.

267
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:58,852
I will not allow this to happen
under my aegis.

268
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,730
- Under your what?
- My aegis.

269
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,313
My auspice. I'm responsible here.

270
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:12,404
You hear that?
He's responsible here, but I'm not.

271
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,616
Now, goddamn it,
I need some answers.

272
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:18,203
I got a splitting headache,
I'm seeing double.

273
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,326
Shit, I think I'm gonna throw up.

274
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:24,795
He took off in a wagon. A brow...
Maroon. Maroon Ford wagon.

275
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:28,167
He said something about going north
to Bakersfield. But that's all.

276
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:31,296
He didn't say any more and I didn't ask.
That's it.

277
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,921
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Don't puke. Don't puke.

278
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,801
Good.

279
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:40,467
What's gonna happen now?

280
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:44,226
You wanna book this guy
for parole violation?

281
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,977
I certainly do not.

282
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:49,562
It's your lucky day.

283
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:58,532
- How's the little woman?
- Wonderful.

284
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:01,790
Good. Uncuff him, will you?

285
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,839
Yeah. This is Jerry Beck.

286
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,256
Beck, this is John.

287
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,801
Yeah. I've got a positive ID
on your suspect.

288
00:28:16,973 --> 00:28:18,172
What?

289
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,923
The stop-and-rob manager
made him for sure.

290
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:22,348
It's Burns, all right.

291
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:24,679
He's got that tattoo
on that right arm of his.

292
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:27,810
The circle, the cross,
the lightning bolt.

293
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,811
It's Burns, for sure.

294
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:13,485
Hi. It's me.

295
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,322
Merry Christmas.

296
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,783
How are the kids?

297
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,449
Good.

298
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,705
Are you okay?

299
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:30,500
Well, it hasn't exactly
been a joyous holiday season...

300
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:32,379
...for me either.

301
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,753
I didn't mean anything by that.

302
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,335
I just meant I know how you feel,
that's all.

303
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:43,048
By the way, you didn't have
to get a restraining order...

304
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:45,218
...to keep me
from stopping by the school.

305
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:47,968
All you had to do was ask.

306
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,979
It's not like I've been hanging out
in a overcoat...

307
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:56,153
...with sunglasses, you know.

308
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,571
Fine. Are the kids there?

309
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:06,368
Because I'm their father.
I'd like to talk to them.

310
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,245
I'd like to wish them merry Christmas.

311
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:16,713
Goddamn it, do we have to do this
over every goddamn little thing?

312
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:20,051
I'm their father.

313
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,091
I wanna talk to them
and I'd like to stop by later...

314
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:26,848
...and give them their... Their presents.
Is that all right?

315
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:30,305
I am their goddamned father, Gloria.

316
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,773
How can they be in bed?
They're not in bed.

317
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:39,064
I can hear them
in the fucking background.

318
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,490
Gloria.

319
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,366
Gloria, Gloria, don't hang up.
Gloria?

320
00:30:45,537 --> 00:30:49,321
Goddamn! Jesus!

321
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:59,548
Damn son of a bitch.

322
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,227
Got a minute?

323
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,389
- You startled me.
- That makes two of us.

324
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,357
What happened to you?

325
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:02,695
How'd you find out?

326
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:05,984
- I'm a cop, remember?
- I'm sorry.

327
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,612
You're sorry?

328
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:11,616
It's not what you think.

329
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:14,707
- How do you know what I'm thinking?
- It's all over your face.

330
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,833
You wanna come inside?
I can make coffee.

331
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,576
- That's bullshit.
- Don't be rude.

332
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:20,954
I'm sorry. I don't know...

333
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:24,418
I didn't come here for an apology.
Nothing that complicated.

334
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,302
I just wanna know why.

335
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,298
I wanted to tell you. I intended to.

336
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,299
The next thing I knew,
we were in bed.

337
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:34,093
- Bullshit. It didn't happen that fast.
- Well, for me it did.

338
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,310
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- You keep saying that.

339
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:37,939
That's because you keep lying.

340
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:40,432
- He was your husband.
- Who are you to judge me?

341
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,270
I don't know.
Who do you have to be?

342
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:44,521
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Nancy. Hi, Alma.

343
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,651
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

344
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:53,033
Yes, he was my husband. Was.

345
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:55,407
We'd been separated
for eight months.

346
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:58,418
God, why am I explaining myself
to you? I don't have to.

347
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,958
Well, it'd be damned nice
if somebody did.

348
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,799
Look.
What exactly do you wanna know?

349
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:06,920
I'd like to know why you jumped in
and out of bed with me?

350
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,170
If you wanted something,
why didn't you ask?

351
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,383
- It would've saved us time and energy.
- I didn't plan it.

352
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,847
I didn't expect it.

353
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:18,597
It was Christmas Eve and I was alone.

354
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,982
That's all?

355
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,107
No.

356
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,068
That's not all.

357
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:34,532
No. I wanted something else.
At least, I thought I did.

358
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,954
I wanted you to find the man
who killed Gary.

359
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:41,950
That's my job.

360
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,712
Find him and kill him.

361
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,553
- That's not my job.
- He deserves to die.

362
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,306
He may.

363
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:58,467
Not the way you got in mind.

364
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:01,354
See you around.

365
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,287
Merry Christmas to you too.

366
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,081
The fucking door was locked.

367
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:16,679
That's against the law...

368
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,015
...to keep an exit door locked
during business hours.

369
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,762
Right?

370
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,976
- Ain't that right?
- You're right, Ray.

371
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:26,892
I'm right.

372
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:30,270
Sleepy, why don't we get everybody...

373
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:32,105
...and get them down on the floor?

374
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,907
Down.

375
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:38,904
Move it.

376
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,464
Raymond! Cash register.

377
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,229
The fucking thing won't open.

378
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:14,029
How does the cash register open?

379
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,652
It sticks.

380
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:20,278
It sticks, Raymond.
You gotta hit it on the side.

381
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,786
Bingo.

382
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,451
This asshole's got pesos.

383
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:33,749
What the fuck are we gonna do
with pesos?

384
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:05,368
Jerry, 41.

385
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:15,459
Yeah, Beck here.

386
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:19,712
Walker Hillard here. Chief of police
in Cottonwood, Arizona.

387
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:23,090
We got this little Mexican bar
right outside of...

388
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,013
Hey, come on, come on, come on,
now down.

389
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:27,513
No, I'm talking to the dog.

390
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,521
Look, we got this little Mexican bar
right outside of town.

391
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:31,969
It got robbed last night.

392
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:36,146
After they robbed it, they laid everybody
on the floor and they shot them all.

393
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,730
Now, I saw your teletype...

394
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:41,356
...I wondered if it could have anything
to do with that.

395
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,692
Sit tight, chief. I'll be right out.

396
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,111
Beck, this could be your lucky day.
I got a report from one of my boys.

397
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,330
He spotted a maroon Ford wagon...

398
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,873
...heading out to the Steadman
ranch this morning.

399
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:57,165
- You're kidding.
- I figure it's won'th a shot. Go on.

400
00:37:58,008 --> 00:38:00,084
Lombard, tow this thing out of here.

401
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,929
Chief, that's my car.

402
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,811
You know, if this turns out
to be the right station wagon...

403
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:18,894
...Iooks like we could be overmatched.

404
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,063
How's that?

405
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:24,489
Well, we've got a few handguns
and maybe a shotgun or two.

406
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:29,451
It says here on your deputy's report
the bad guys used automatics.

407
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:34,249
Maybe a MAC-10 or two.
That's what I call overmatched.

408
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:35,872
Did you read this?

409
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:38,371
Let me give you a piece of advice here,
Beck.

410
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:41,465
You're a city cop.
If I was in the city, I'd listen to you.

411
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,841
This ain't the big city,
this is Cottonwood.

412
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:48,009
Population 2231,
and I am the chief of police.

413
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,635
This is my town, my territory.

414
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:55,725
To make it real simple,
nobody's gonna fuck with me here.

415
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,820
Dorothy,
we're arriving at the Steadman place.

416
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:08,779
Have Bonnie send over
a couple of steak sandwiches...

417
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:11,870
...from the office about 12:30.
Thank you. What?

418
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,948
Fries or baked?

419
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,082
- What? Oh, fries.
- Fries. Fries.

420
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,541
Thanks, hon. Fries.

421
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:33,382
You don't need the gun.
Just tell them who you are.

422
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:36,052
- Fuck you, Beck.
- Fuck you too, chief.

423
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:40,396
And your goddamned french fries.

424
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:12,736
Jackson. Get my hat.

425
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:16,243
Never mind the hat. Get up here.
Get up here.

426
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,204
Go to the highway
and flag down a car.

427
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:21,658
It could be hours before it dawns
on Dorothy that something's wrong.

428
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:24,207
Sir,
I got two years seniority on Randall...

429
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:27,629
Because I'm sending you,
now get the fuck out of here.

430
00:42:10,883 --> 00:42:12,627
Gentlemen, who's Beck?

431
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:16,052
- I'm Beck.
- Arthur Kressler, FBI.

432
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:19,840
I got your message about the break
in the Kimble case and I flew right out.

433
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:23,018
They said you were out of radio contact.
What happened here?

434
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,345
Now, here's another one.
Listen to this.

435
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:27,978
"This is a time
to put our differences aside...

436
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,439
...and concentrate on what we share.

437
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:32,900
Our common vision of a new America,
purged of..."

438
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:36,357
Sounds like typical
white-supremacy rhetoric to me.

439
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,577
Yeah?

440
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:42,829
You mean they just sit around
and write this shit all the time?

441
00:42:42,998 --> 00:42:44,825
Half of them are in prison anyway.

442
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,871
I suppose it helps them
pass the time of day.

443
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:51,039
Is that tape on your glasses?

444
00:42:56,136 --> 00:43:00,264
Yeah. I lost one of those little screws.
Fell out.

445
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:05,346
You know,
what struck me is they keep talking...

446
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:08,687
...about this big meeting
that they're gonna have...

447
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:12,191
...where they unite
and create one organization...

448
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:14,733
...one power structure.

449
00:43:17,157 --> 00:43:21,202
They...
They get real carried away, man.

450
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:24,822
Like they're the fucking
Knights of the Round Table...

451
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,456
...Iooking for King Arthur.
God almighty.

452
00:43:29,628 --> 00:43:31,786
Look, Beck,
I understand what you're saying.

453
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:34,964
All I'm trying to do is tell you
what the bureau's position is.

454
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,624
That these groups
have no unity or central authority.

455
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:41,088
They're fragmented,
territorial and isolated.

456
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:44,517
Come on. I'll give you a lift back
in the chopper.

457
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:47,888
I wanna get out an APB as soon
as possible on that station wagon.

458
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:49,605
Excuse me.

459
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:54,397
You don't wanna take
any of these letters?

460
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,353
Of course I'll take them, but I doubt
they're gonna carry much weight.

461
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:44,785
I called the captain 's office.

462
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:48,037
The secretary said that she's sure
the money went out yesterday.

463
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:49,907
Yes, they're double-checking.

464
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,241
Meanwhile, I'm in Oklahoma City.

465
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:57,371
It is 36 fucking degrees here
and I am freezing my ass off.

466
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:00,376
Reimburse what, Henry?

467
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,920
Do you have any idea what
a goddamn divorce costs these days?

468
00:45:04,097 --> 00:45:06,173
Do you have an idea
what these lawyers cost?

469
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:10,346
My credit cards are maxed out.
I can't reimburse shit.

470
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:16,642
Yes, all right. All right.

471
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,893
I'm on my way to Bogan now.

472
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:42,832
Yeah, it's like I told you,
I'd pick you up at the dance.

473
00:45:43,094 --> 00:45:46,379
No. No, that's what I said.

474
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:50,637
No, until the divorce goes through,
that's the way it's gotta be.

475
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,098
Look, I got some business
I gotta take care of.

476
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,310
I'll see you later. Okay?

477
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,103
Cute sign, chief.

478
00:46:00,277 --> 00:46:01,558
Yeah.

479
00:46:01,737 --> 00:46:04,691
Fucking ACLU,
the commie Jew bastards...

480
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:07,190
...made us take it down.
Used to be out front.

481
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,159
Don't make no difference.

482
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:12,080
Ain't no nigger gonna stay in this town
after sundown.

483
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:15,203
Oh, by the way, I briefed my boys.

484
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:18,579
No sign of a maroon Ford wagon
so far.

485
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,874
Are you cold?

486
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:23,543
Does it show?

487
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:27,302
Yeah, blue lips will give you away
every time.

488
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,720
You California boys got it too easy.

489
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,598
All that sunshine and pussy
thins the blood.

490
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:45,226
Yeah, that's us.
Land of milk and honey.

491
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:47,813
Morning briefings on the beach.

492
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:51,075
And every once in a while,
some asshole kills a cop...

493
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:53,617
...and everybody gets pissed off.

494
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:57,164
No more beach, no more sunshine
and pussy until the guy's caught.

495
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:02,661
Yeah, we draw straws
out of our banana daiquiris.

496
00:47:03,548 --> 00:47:05,624
Which is why I'm here, chief.

497
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:07,916
Short straw.

498
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:13,514
You know a man named Gebhardt?

499
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:18,801
- Why?
- Well, I'd like to pay him a visit.

500
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:23,349
I have reason to believe that
Bobby Burns might contact him.

501
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:25,649
Well,
I think you got your names mixed up.

502
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,276
I don't think so, chief.

503
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:31,733
I got his name and phone number
out of Bobby's phone book.

504
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:34,942
Maybe they have something else
in common.

505
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:36,995
Maybe they like to hunt ducks.

506
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:40,578
Oh, I think they've got a little
more in common than ducks.

507
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:41,997
Such as?

508
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,124
Such as white supremacy.

509
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:51,792
It's probably an alien concept
around here...

510
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:56,598
...but there are actually groups of people
who hate anyone that isn't like them.

511
00:47:56,768 --> 00:47:59,971
Gebhardt's place is about
a half an hour's drive from here.

512
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:03,100
I got some business to take care of.

513
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:05,647
I'll call you later this afternoon.

514
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,864
I got the address
and I got a car, chief.

515
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:14,362
I won't wait long.

516
00:48:14,994 --> 00:48:16,868
Without me or a search warrant...

517
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:19,789
...you won't set foot
on Gebhardt's property.

518
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,081
You got a search warrant?

519
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:25,874
Chief, there's a guy out there
from the FBI.

520
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:29,712
FBI? Shit. Well, bring him on in.

521
00:48:33,638 --> 00:48:37,256
Arthur Kressler, special agent
assigned to the Kimble murder.

522
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:40,138
I got word on your lead
and I flew right out.

523
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:41,515
How's it going?

524
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:44,356
Well, to tell you the truth,
a little slow.

525
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,193
It's not the chief's fault.

526
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,445
He's just been busy as hell
these days. Right, chief?

527
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:55,490
You didn't tell me
the FBI was in on this.

528
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,285
Oh, my fault, chief.

529
00:48:57,453 --> 00:49:00,573
Well, you see,
I don't really think of Art as FBI.

530
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:03,702
I think of him more as a friend.

531
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:06,457
We hang out at the beach together.

532
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:36,145
I don 't believe
I've ever seen a cross like that...

533
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:39,444
...on a church before, Reverend.

534
00:49:39,786 --> 00:49:42,159
Exactly what denomination is that?

535
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:50,038
The Aryan Nation Church of Christ,
Mr. Beck.

536
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,801
How does that differ from, say,
oh, the Baptists?

537
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:58,590
It embodies the nucleus
of what America once was...

538
00:49:58,764 --> 00:50:01,136
...and will be again, Mr. Beck.

539
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:05,727
And just what is that, Reverend?

540
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:07,769
White and pure, Mr. Beck.

541
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,691
Cleansed
of its present racial impurities.

542
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,358
Our nation has become adulterated
by people of low blood.

543
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:17,281
They act like parasites on a giant oak,
feeding on it...

544
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,652
...day by day sapping its strength.

545
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:26,493
You make a powerful case, Reverend.

546
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:31,159
Frankly, I never looked at it that way.

547
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:33,544
Well, you're not alone, Mr. Beck.

548
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:36,918
Fortunately,
there are those among us who have.

549
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:42,889
I guess that brings me
to why we're here.

550
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,883
Do you know this man?

551
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:50,846
- I don't believe I do, Mr. Beck.
- Mr. Beck.

552
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,810
Thank you.

553
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:58,569
His name is Robert Burns, or Bobby.

554
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:03,158
We have reason to believe
he might contact you.

555
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:06,156
Well, we have many friends
who stop by, Mr. Beck.

556
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:10,743
Friends from coast to coast
and border to border.

557
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:39,269
It's him.

558
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:43,274
It's the guy with the cops
from the Steadman place.

559
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,578
It's the guy that sighted me
with the.38.

560
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:48,952
What the fuck is he doing
in Oklahoma?

561
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:50,202
I don't know.

562
00:51:56,088 --> 00:51:57,251
Maybe he's a fed.

563
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:02,209
He's no fed. Feds are neat.

564
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:06,847
Whoever this guy is,
he wouldn't last a week with the feds.

565
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,767
The other guy's coming over.

566
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:15,104
Now, he is a fed. Look at him.

567
00:52:15,274 --> 00:52:18,643
So clean, you could shoot him
and bury him in the same suit.

568
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:22,150
But that other motherfucker...

569
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,532
...I can't figure him out.

570
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,911
It's kind of hard to reconcile this
with godliness and hot apple turnovers.

571
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,701
Yeah, the scary part
is they put up such a good front.

572
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:42,165
No,
the scary part is, is that it ain't no front.

573
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,220
Nine millimeter.

574
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:54,175
Bobby Burns' weapon of choice.

575
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,932
So you think he's been here?

576
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,604
I know he's been here.

577
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:20,085
You mind telling me what took you?
It's freezing out here.

578
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,793
Chief wanted his coat back.

579
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,169
You didn't bring a cold-weather coat?
What's the matter with you?

580
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:29,131
Nothing that a little overdue
expense money wouldn't cure.

581
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,472
Tell me. You got any new ideas
about what we're dealing with here?

582
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,477
- Like what?
- Come on, Kressler, open your eyes.

583
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,136
These people
aren't a ragtag bunch of yahoos...

584
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:41,481
...that drink beer and run around
in sheets on Saturday night.

585
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,229
They got money behind them.

586
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:46,108
They got strong pockets
of community support.

587
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,190
No proof.
You don't know that for sure.

588
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:52,031
The hell I don't.
We just walked out of one.

589
00:53:52,203 --> 00:53:55,074
Who the fuck do you think called ahead
and warned Gebhardt?

590
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,573
- They were standing on the porch...
- Excuse me.

591
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,375
As one professional to another...

592
00:53:59,544 --> 00:54:03,458
...I would appreciate if you would
minimize your constant use of profanity.

593
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,135
- You're kidding.
- No, sir, I'm not kidding.

594
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,171
I'm telling you
something's going on here.

595
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:14,720
I'm telling you something big
is happening here...

596
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:19,222
...and all that grabs you is my language?
What the fuck is the matter with you?

597
00:54:19,397 --> 00:54:22,232
That's a good example.
I'm a Christian, Beck.

598
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,401
I'm sure that seems like probably a joke
or something to you...

599
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,405
...but I find your language
personally offensive.

600
00:54:29,907 --> 00:54:32,529
If you need me for anything,
I'll be at the Marriott...

601
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,153
...in Oklahoma City until 9.
My flight leaves at 10:05.

602
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:42,418
I'd get a cold-weather coat
if I were you.

603
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,547
You could freeze to death
in this weather.

604
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:06,233
Excuse me?

605
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:10,484
You...

606
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:13,229
You mean because Western Uniors
computers are down...

607
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:15,200
...I can't get my money?

608
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,751
Well, can you tell me
when they're gonna be back up?

609
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:30,546
I don't fucking believe this.

610
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,621
Keep driving.

611
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:13,250
You're gonna turn left
at the street right up here, okay?

612
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:37,239
Who are you?

613
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:43,238
You first.

614
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,580
I'm the Grim Reaper.

615
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:49,955
Now you.

616
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,501
I'm a cop from L.A.

617
00:56:59,305 --> 00:57:00,883
You're no cop from L.A.

618
00:57:01,057 --> 00:57:05,007
I saw you in Arizona
and now here in Oklahoma.

619
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:08,105
Fuck it.

620
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:12,389
It doesn't matter who you are
when you're dead.

621
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,156
You know,
before you kiss this world goodbye...

622
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:22,325
...there is something you should know.

623
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:27,620
You cops, judges,
whatever the hell you are...

624
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:30,955
...you keep thinking
you can solve the problem...

625
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:33,370
...by putting us in jail.

626
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,464
Or killing us.

627
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:40,047
That's what the Romans thought
when they took Christian people...

628
00:57:40,221 --> 00:57:44,219
...and they fed them to lions.
That's what the Romans thought...

629
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:48,472
...when they took Christians
and they put them into the sewers.

630
00:57:48,646 --> 00:57:50,437
Catacombs.

631
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:53,015
It's the same thing today.

632
00:57:53,192 --> 00:57:55,897
Only the catacombs
have different names.

633
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:00,233
Like San Quentin and Soledad...

634
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:04,026
...and a hundred other prisons
across this country.

635
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:10,113
Because you see,
it didn't die in the sewers of Rome.

636
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:13,662
It grew and grew.

637
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:16,922
One idea, one cause.

638
00:58:17,091 --> 00:58:19,629
Every single prisoner's got it.

639
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:25,723
And the Romans couldn't kill it
and neither can kiss-ass liberals...

640
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:26,970
...or cops.

641
00:58:32,648 --> 00:58:34,771
Very easy.

642
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:36,526
I'm right here.

643
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:16,021
This is 45 Adam.
Officer needs assistance.

644
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:24,061
Shit.

645
01:00:08,284 --> 01:00:10,360
Go. Go. Go.

646
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:19,460
Freeze! Arms away from your head!

647
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:21,705
Don't shoot, don't shoot, I'm a cop.

648
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:26,045
- Don't move!
- I'm a cop, I'm a cop from L.A.

649
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:29,588
I got some ID. Right here.

650
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:31,300
See?

651
01:00:33,893 --> 01:00:34,972
One more thing.

652
01:00:35,144 --> 01:00:37,931
I call a man back for an assignment,
I don't wanna hear...

653
01:00:38,106 --> 01:00:42,020
...a 15-minute recitation on the phone
in order to accomplish it.

654
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:45,277
I got a tremendous amount
of bullshit going on here.

655
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:47,854
I don't need any additional tsuris.

656
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:51,068
But, Jerry, I like you,
so I'm not gonna waltz you around.

657
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:54,659
- You're in big trouble on this one.
- It's Agent Kressler, the asshole...

658
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,915
It's Agent Kressler,
it's a P.O. Named Webly.

659
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,207
It's patrol officers
from Kimble's murder...

660
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:03,829
...who said that you acted
in an insensitive manner.

661
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:07,874
It is a goddamn Greek chorus of folks,
Jerry.

662
01:01:08,052 --> 01:01:10,590
There are complaints
of excessive drinking...

663
01:01:10,763 --> 01:01:14,891
...language unbecoming an officer,
physical intimidation...

664
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:17,348
...and kidnapping.

665
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:21,221
Look, I didn't kidnap anyone. L...

666
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:25,692
That's a beautiful rebuttal,
considering the list of charges.

667
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:29,233
Chief, look,
before you make any decisions...

668
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:33,736
...you've gotta look at this stuff.
This is the map that I told you about.

669
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:36,912
All right, here is the route. Right here.

670
01:01:37,081 --> 01:01:39,951
I got names and addresses of people.

671
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:43,043
These are the letters.
These are just some of the letters.

672
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:45,963
I'm telling you,
there's something big going on here.

673
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:47,376
More than anyone guessed.

674
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:49,875
This isn't a group of people
standing around...

675
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:52,839
...yelling "nigger" and "kike" and...
And "spic." This...

676
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,171
This is a goddamn movement.

677
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:58,184
This is... They got organization.
They got money.

678
01:01:58,352 --> 01:02:00,344
They got resources
I wish the fuck we had.

679
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:03,724
Jerry, not now.
Let's deal with first things first...

680
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:05,856
...like keeping you on this case.

681
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:08,102
Now, to do that,
I'm gonna need some help.

682
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:11,481
Some ammunition
only you can provide.

683
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:15,072
I've set up an appointment
with a Dr. Krantz...

684
01:02:15,243 --> 01:02:18,244
...one of those
department psychiatrists.

685
01:02:18,413 --> 01:02:21,284
You convince him you're okay,
you're on the next flight out.

686
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:26,668
Four o'clock this afternoon.
Don't be late and don't fuck it up.

687
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,014
Mr. Beck? Dr. Krantz.

688
01:02:39,518 --> 01:02:41,843
- Pleased to meet you, doctor.
- Come in.

689
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,460
I know how stressful
these things can be.

690
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,375
Just think of me as one of the guys.

691
01:03:16,054 --> 01:03:18,461
Did I say something funny, Mr. Beck?

692
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,676
No. No, doc. It's just...

693
01:03:21,851 --> 01:03:25,220
This is... This is real important to me.

694
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:29,441
It's also real important
that you be completely honest here.

695
01:03:29,942 --> 01:03:32,647
Yes. Yes, I understand.

696
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,276
L... I'm gonna be completely honest.

697
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:37,108
Good.

698
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:40,399
Then let's get back
to my original question.

699
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:43,244
Did I say something funny, Mr. Beck?

700
01:03:44,123 --> 01:03:46,531
Look, can we...? Can we just drop it?

701
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:49,494
We're not here to drop things,
Mr. Beck.

702
01:03:53,132 --> 01:03:54,710
Okay.

703
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:58,876
I mean, you're... You're a psychologist,
you're trained and...

704
01:03:59,055 --> 01:04:01,842
And you understand these things.

705
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:15,604
I mean, the rest of the world
walks around with these fragile egos.

706
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,689
You're rambling, Mr. Beck.

707
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:29,450
Well, the truth of it...

708
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:35,044
The truth is that you...

709
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:37,837
You kind of look like Woody Allen.

710
01:04:47,436 --> 01:04:49,429
And when you said:

711
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:55,523
"Think of me as one of the guys..."

712
01:05:01,408 --> 01:05:05,785
How did I get to this?

713
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:08,872
I don't know.

714
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:12,249
It just happened.

715
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:18,289
Just like this case.

716
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:20,501
I didn't ask for it.

717
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:23,169
It just happened.

718
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:29,465
But it's okay, it's my case.

719
01:05:31,354 --> 01:05:33,062
I started it...

720
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:36,267
...and I just wanna finish it.

721
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:42,982
Is there any point in...?
In going on with this? I mean...

722
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:46,444
...I'm a dead man.

723
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,786
If that's true, Mr. Beck,
you died by your own hand.

724
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:54,200
It was the Woody Allen thing, right?

725
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:59,419
No one responds well to ridicule,
Mr. Beck, even psychiatrists.

726
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:02,164
God almighty.

727
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:09,088
I swear to God to you,
I didn't mean that as ridicule.

728
01:06:09,517 --> 01:06:14,060
Whatever else happens here today,
that is the truth.

729
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,516
I'm afraid our time is up, Mr. Beck.

730
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,799
We tried it your way, doc.

731
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:55,305
- Now we're gonna try it mine.
- Get out of this office.

732
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,813
You're not a safe man
to put on the streets, Mr. Beck.

733
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:03,360
You're not a safe man
to put in this office, Dr. Krantz.

734
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:07,736
If I get pulled off of this case
because you look like Woody Allen...

735
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:10,826
...I will not be responsible
for what I will do.

736
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:13,996
If you got some dues to pay there,
then by God, you pay them...

737
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:16,288
...because I will not.

738
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:21,417
I will fixate on you
as the instrument of my destruction...

739
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:26,334
...and you will never feel safe
in your world again.

740
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,176
Yeah.

741
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,797
I'll hold.

742
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,933
Morning, captain.

743
01:08:18,312 --> 01:08:22,226
Oh, yeah. It's a wonder what
a good night's sleep will do for you.

744
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:31,739
I did?

745
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:39,288
Son of a bitch.

746
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,624
No, sir.

747
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:43,538
Yes, sir.

748
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,123
Yes, sir.

749
01:08:47,883 --> 01:08:49,425
Thank you.

750
01:08:52,637 --> 01:08:54,179
Woody fucking Allen.

751
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,677
Jerry Beck?

752
01:09:02,856 --> 01:09:04,979
Yeah, hi. Is Captain Dixon with you?

753
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,348
You're looking at him.

754
01:09:07,861 --> 01:09:08,940
No shit?

755
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:10,984
No shit.

756
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:16,279
- You know the Selby place?
- I know the place and the man.

757
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:19,619
Arlen Selby
is a major Klucker in these parts.

758
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:21,866
We're gonna need men for backup...

759
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,414
...and it only takes one
with mixed loyalties.

760
01:09:24,586 --> 01:09:27,207
I think I can guarantee
that won't happen.

761
01:09:27,922 --> 01:09:31,422
Meet seven of Kellmars finest.
Gentlemen, Jerry Beck.

762
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:34,926
- Mr. Beck.
- Not a Klucker among them.

763
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:37,631
I feel better already.

764
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,968
- Is this your boy?
- Yeah.

765
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:51,228
- Hi there.
- Hi.

766
01:09:51,404 --> 01:09:54,073
You must be a pretty important guy.

767
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:59,361
Got a fellow, flew in this afternoon
just because you're here.

768
01:09:59,912 --> 01:10:02,119
Curtis, we got some business to do.

769
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:04,163
I'm glad you could make it, Beck.

770
01:10:07,086 --> 01:10:08,664
Yeah.

771
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,127
Thanks for all the help.

772
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:16,761
Sorry, Kressler, but me and the doc,
we got along just like that.

773
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:20,263
- Two peas in a pod.
- Really?

774
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:23,220
What did you do?
Threaten his wife and kids?

775
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:26,387
I see you two guys
are already acquainted.

776
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:29,351
What do you say we take care
of some business over here?

777
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,186
According to my information...

778
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:37,782
...I think it's best that we're in position
no later than 5:45, right here.

779
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:45,447
Why do I get the feeling
you got something else on your mind?

780
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:48,744
You tell me.

781
01:10:50,087 --> 01:10:53,004
I sense you've got unfinished business
wrapped up in this...

782
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:56,708
...and it worries me.
So I made some calls.

783
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:01,639
I like to know who I'm working with.

784
01:11:01,807 --> 01:11:04,512
You see, I got a wife and kids waiting.
So does Franklin.

785
01:11:04,685 --> 01:11:06,559
I make it a point to go home.

786
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,646
You can call L.A., you can call anywhere
they've got a phone.

787
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,642
It's bullshit and you know it.

788
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:14,569
There's only one question about me
that matters.

789
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:19,111
And that is, is there anyone
that'd be afraid...

790
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:21,441
...to go through a door with me?

791
01:11:23,036 --> 01:11:25,954
And you already know the answer
to that question.

792
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:29,037
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here
in the first place.

793
01:11:29,209 --> 01:11:31,118
It's not quite that simple.

794
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:33,999
The hell it isn't.

795
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:39,210
That's what's so great about this job,
captain.

796
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,426
It's as simple as it gets.

797
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:45,890
Death and taxes.

798
01:12:43,074 --> 01:12:45,991
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

799
01:14:21,797 --> 01:14:23,291
This is the FBI.

800
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:26,499
Freeze. Nobody move.

801
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:28,550
- Get down.
- Down on the floor.

802
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,390
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- This is the FBI.

803
01:14:31,556 --> 01:14:34,676
Ladies, outside, move, move.
Let's go.

804
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:37,639
- Get down.
- Get down, Mrs. Gebhardt. Get down.

805
01:14:37,813 --> 01:14:41,016
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Robert "Bobby" Burns...

806
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:43,231
...and three John Does.

807
01:14:43,402 --> 01:14:45,893
We have reason to believe
they're on the premises.

808
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:49,533
- All right, all right.
- Get on the floor.

809
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,789
I repeat. This is the FBI.

810
01:14:55,956 --> 01:15:00,119
Comply with this federal warrant
and put down your arms immediately.

811
01:15:00,293 --> 01:15:03,378
I didn't expect to find you here,
Reverend.

812
01:15:03,964 --> 01:15:05,790
Nor I you, Mr. Beck.

813
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:09,417
- You out spreading the gospel?
- In a manner of speaking.

814
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:13,513
Well, spread this gospel.

815
01:15:13,682 --> 01:15:16,469
You tell your men out front
to throw down their weapons...

816
01:15:16,643 --> 01:15:19,181
...and comply with the federal warrant.

817
01:15:22,273 --> 01:15:23,898
Now.

818
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:31,939
This is Reverend Gebhardt.

819
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,071
I want your full attention.

820
01:15:35,787 --> 01:15:39,701
This is not the time or the place
for an armed confrontation.

821
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:42,998
We have nothing to hide.

822
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:46,500
I want you to lay down your weapons.

823
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,632
I repeat.

824
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:53,387
Lay down your weapons.

825
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:21,742
Beck,
I'm through playing catch-up with you.

826
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,659
You've been hiding evidence from me.

827
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:26,670
Whatever happens here today,
I want it.

828
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,001
Hands on your heads.
Against the wall. Move.

829
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:16,046
All right, Mr. Kressler.

830
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,671
We have complied with your wishes,
now kindly comply with ours.

831
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:21,093
Please leave.

832
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,014
Beck, apparently you were wrong.
He's not here after all.

833
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,062
What do you suggest now?

834
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:31,980
We set up our shop
in one of the barracks over there, huh?

835
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:38,115
I told you, I get the evidence,
win or lose.

836
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:59,835
Look, he's not in the church,
main house, kitchen, storage area.

837
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:03,714
I mean, I looked places you couldn't
hide a kid, no less four adults.

838
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:13,599
- He's gotta be here.
- Jerry, I don't think he's here.

839
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:17,395
This is the place. It's all in place.
Like in the letters.

840
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:20,277
The meeting
to create a new covenant, the...

841
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,075
- The map said...
- Jerry, I gotta...

842
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:25,244
...he was gonna be in Oklahoma City.
He was in Oklahoma City...

843
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:26,907
...and he's gotta be here.

844
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:30,285
Look, if that head Nazi makes a call,
my ass is grass.

845
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,868
Damn it,
all the roads lead to this place.

846
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:40,459
Look, it's time to walk away.
I backed you as much as I can on this.

847
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:39,934
This is an outrage.
A blatant violation of constitutional law.

848
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:44,442
I demand legal counsel before
you take another step in this church.

849
01:19:45,576 --> 01:19:49,159
Leave these premises now
or face a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

850
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,488
Go ahead, because I'm already broke.

851
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:55,745
My goddamn ex-wife beat you to it.
Come on, let's go.

852
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,917
Is the FBI broke, Mr. Kressler?

853
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:05,588
Look, just give me five minutes
and I'll settle everything, okay?

854
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:13,095
You're out of here, Beck.
You hear me?

855
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:16,022
You are history, mister.
Do you hear me?

856
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,348
I heard you.
Now stay the fuck out of my way.

857
01:20:18,525 --> 01:20:21,443
Your unprofessional behavior
is jeopardizing all our careers.

858
01:20:22,571 --> 01:20:25,109
I'm talking to you, mister.

859
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:28,400
You are off this case.

860
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:30,986
No such luck, dickface.

861
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:33,998
You wanna do it right now, Beck?
You wanna go right now?

862
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:37,451
Settle this somewhere else.
This is not the time or the place!

863
01:20:37,628 --> 01:20:39,953
- This operation is over.
- Just back off.

864
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:47,354
Shit.

865
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,555
This is the FBI.

866
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:17,808
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Robert "Bobby" Burns...

867
01:22:17,977 --> 01:22:20,017
...and three John Doe accomplices.

868
01:22:20,188 --> 01:22:23,272
You're completely surrounded.
Surrender immediately.

869
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:10,527
He's dead.

870
01:23:27,838 --> 01:23:29,416
All right.

871
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:31,711
We gotta split up.

872
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:36,889
Franklin. Kressler.

873
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,427
John.

874
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:50,542
Die, nigger.

875
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:56,917
Put some pressure on it.

876
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,845
Let's go!

877
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,699
I'm okay. Take him.

878
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,489
Five, six.

879
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:03,804
It's you.

880
01:30:04,106 --> 01:30:06,561
Jesus Christ.

881
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,270
Why are you doing this to me?

882
01:30:10,445 --> 01:30:12,485
You killed a cop in L.A.

883
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:15,734
I didn't kill a cop.

884
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:18,574
The hell you didn't.

885
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:25,746
Don't lie to me, asshole.

886
01:30:28,004 --> 01:30:32,002
You're dying. Don't lie to me.
Give it up, Bobby.

887
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:34,547
I don't know
what you're talking about.

888
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:40,842
You robbed that store
and then you shot the manager.

889
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:43,722
And then when the cop pulled you over
to question you...

890
01:30:43,895 --> 01:30:46,351
...you shot him right in the face.

891
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:48,896
You pumped a dozen rounds
of 9 mm...

892
01:30:49,067 --> 01:30:53,361
...right in his goddamn face,
didn't you, you son of a bitch?

893
01:30:58,326 --> 01:31:00,698
You got the wrong guy.

894
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:08,456
You got the wrong guy.

895
01:31:15,218 --> 01:31:17,756
You shot the wrong guy.

896
01:31:18,137 --> 01:31:22,680
You've been following this guy
for 1500 miles and he didn't do it.

897
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:25,891
You don't know that.

898
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:33,902
How do you know that?

899
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:37,106
The same way you do.
I heard him say it.

900
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:40,033
And whether you like it or not,
it's true.

901
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:51,332
John.

902
01:31:51,504 --> 01:31:54,588
You killed him.
You killed my brother.

903
01:31:55,424 --> 01:31:56,919
John, l...

904
01:31:58,344 --> 01:32:02,507
- I didn't want it to go down like...
- I didn't even get a chance to tell him.

905
01:32:02,682 --> 01:32:07,011
I drove up from New Mexico last night
and he was asleep.

906
01:32:07,186 --> 01:32:08,728
Now he'll never know what I did.

907
01:32:09,897 --> 01:32:14,689
He'll never know I had it too.
I had the same blood that he did.

908
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:16,813
Fire and ice.

909
01:32:17,988 --> 01:32:19,696
He loved me.

910
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:22,367
He would have killed for me.

911
01:32:22,535 --> 01:32:25,239
But he didn't think I had it.

912
01:32:26,038 --> 01:32:30,499
So I got a Browning just like his
and I went into that store...

913
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:32,951
...and I shot that nigger...

914
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:36,912
...and I shot your fucking cop too
on the way home.

915
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:40,958
He came up to me
and I looked him straight in the eyes.

916
01:32:41,136 --> 01:32:45,798
I smiled and I said,
"Merry Christmas, officer."

917
01:32:48,811 --> 01:32:51,895
I had that motherfucker dead bang,
and I blew him away.

918
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:55,356
I put a bullet in him
for every time some cop...

919
01:32:55,526 --> 01:32:58,776
...fucked with my brother,
since he was 14 years old.

920
01:32:58,946 --> 01:33:01,104
Now, you put your gun down.
Put it down.

921
01:33:01,281 --> 01:33:04,152
I wanna see your gun on the floor.

922
01:33:04,326 --> 01:33:06,698
I'll blow your fucking brains out,
faggot.

923
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:24,001
All right. All right, now you.

924
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:26,514
Okay.

925
01:33:27,349 --> 01:33:28,760
Okay, John.

926
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,517
John, first...

927
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:37,017
First I think
you ought to know the truth.

928
01:33:37,192 --> 01:33:38,271
Just listen to me.

929
01:33:40,904 --> 01:33:45,981
I think you ought to know the truth
about what happened here.

930
01:33:50,664 --> 01:33:52,989
I didn't kill your brother, John.

931
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:55,747
He did.

932
01:34:02,926 --> 01:34:04,468
John, give it up, man.

933
01:34:08,223 --> 01:34:09,847
John.

934
01:34:10,934 --> 01:34:14,219
John,
forget all that fire-and-ice bullshit.

935
01:34:14,395 --> 01:34:18,014
Your brother was a pussy
without a Browning in his hand.

936
01:34:18,274 --> 01:34:20,516
And he was a fucking punk
in the joint.

937
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:23,019
He'd bend over
for a pack of cigarettes.

938
01:34:23,196 --> 01:34:26,529
- He sucked every con in the joint, John.
- Shut up!

939
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:30,534
Shut up!

940
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:07,901
I don't have anything to say to you.

941
01:35:10,034 --> 01:35:12,489
You gave up your gun.

942
01:35:13,204 --> 01:35:16,288
You did what no cop should ever do.

943
01:35:16,457 --> 01:35:18,580
He was gonna kill me if I didn't.

944
01:35:18,751 --> 01:35:21,206
He was gonna kill us both anyway.

945
01:35:21,378 --> 01:35:23,501
Who are you to talk?

946
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:26,507
You told him I killed his brother.

947
01:35:26,759 --> 01:35:29,214
If it was up to you,
I'd be dead right now.

948
01:35:30,721 --> 01:35:32,678
It was up to me.

949
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:39,980
I'm pleased to say that this case
is a model example...

950
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:42,305
...of how the FBI
and local law enforcement...

951
01:35:42,483 --> 01:35:46,611
...can not only work together,
but achieve significant results together.

952
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:48,937
In reviewing the letters,
Burns' phone book...

953
01:35:49,114 --> 01:35:51,605
...and other evidence
supplied by Agent Kressler...

954
01:35:51,784 --> 01:35:55,235
...the bureau is revising its position
on white supremacy groups.

955
01:35:55,412 --> 01:35:58,698
There is sufficient evidence...

956
01:35:58,874 --> 01:36:01,745
...to believe
that there is a concerted effort...

957
01:36:01,919 --> 01:36:05,418
...to combine these groups
under a common umbrella.

958
01:36:05,589 --> 01:36:11,093
And so the FBI is forming a task force
to respond to this.

959
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:13,968
Now, I would like to introduce
the agent...

960
01:36:14,139 --> 01:36:17,804
...who has been on this case
from beginning to end, Arthur Kressler.

961
01:36:17,976 --> 01:36:19,850
Thank you, sir.

962
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:23,396
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
There's not much I can add.

963
01:36:23,565 --> 01:36:26,981
I would, however,
like to thank the bureau...

964
01:36:27,152 --> 01:36:31,150
...for its unwavering support
and commitment to this operation.

965
01:36:31,823 --> 01:36:34,943
And also a big clap on the back
to local law enforcement.

966
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:37,609
They were with us
every step of the way.

967
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:41,906
Without them,
we probably wouldn't be here now.

968
01:36:47,464 --> 01:36:48,709
Taxi?

969
01:37:00,602 --> 01:37:02,013
How's your leg?

970
01:37:02,187 --> 01:37:04,226
It hurts like a bitch.
What do you think?

971
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:09,643
Thanks for the lift.

972
01:37:11,196 --> 01:37:12,275
Jerry.

973
01:37:17,035 --> 01:37:19,870
I want you to know
I'd go through a door with you anytime.

974
01:37:22,624 --> 01:37:27,866
And there's more out there
than death and taxes.

975
01:37:28,046 --> 01:37:30,003
A hell of a lot more.

976
01:37:30,423 --> 01:37:32,665
All you gotta do
is give it half the chance.
