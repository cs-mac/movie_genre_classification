1
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,296
Are you asleep?

2
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,616
Start her up!

3
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,342
Stop!

4
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,417
lnspector Marc Ferrot.

5
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,825
Of course.

6
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,297
Quiet at the boss's, isn't it?

7
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,146
Nice, for a chief super.

8
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,866
l fell in love with a woman
with no dowry.

9
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:08,018
The opposite of Mme Ganay.

10
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:12,377
See you at 8 tomorrow
to question those 2 guys.

11
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,702
- Bye, Ferrot.
- Bye, Ménard.

12
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,907
Good day, ma'am.
Sorry to leave early.

13
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,983
- l'll see you out.
- Goodbye.

14
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,257
We should have invited his wife.

15
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,237
Though he'd never have stayed.

16
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,260
Really, Victor, we're bored
by your Sundays in the country.

17
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,945
A country house is for people
who have children

18
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:04,586
or who had them.

19
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:09,540
And he always stays on his own.

20
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,464
l wonder what belly bore him.

21
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,624
- Are you tired?
- l'd like to go home.

22
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,420
Right away, darling.

23
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,327
- Bravo!
- Very good.

24
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:34,897
My wife isn't well, we're going home.
No, you stay.

25
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,343
- ls it serious?
- She thinks she'll be bedridden.

26
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:42,218
You know, Ferrot,
l didn't think the Christanis

27
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:43,786
could be arrested.

28
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,220
l did, sir.

29
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,664
l'd been after them a year.

30
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,258
But be careful, Ferrot.

31
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:56,782
Once again you were alone,
arresting two armed men at night.

32
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,981
Please close the gate.
See you tomorrow.

33
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,580
Goodbye, Mr Ganay.

34
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,466
Caught you red-handed!
You like it?

35
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:39,426
Who are you?
Why were you at the church?

36
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:40,861
You take it well.

37
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43,501
- Pardon?
- No, it was chance.

38
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,167
l was working nights
and took some snaps

39
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:48,218
for my shop window, that's all.

40
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,665
Put your shoes back on.
You'll catch cold.

41
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,104
No. Excuse me.

42
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,466
l'm sorry. l'll bring the photos,
the negatives too.

43
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:04,456
Sorry.

44
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,817
Shall l bring them?
Tonight?

45
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,687
- Tomorrow?
- l don't know.

46
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:14,623
Where, when?

47
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,544
Last train from Paris tomorrow.

48
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,024
Let's carry on.

49
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,747
We've said the same thing
for 8 hours.

50
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:56,997
What time is the
last train from Paris?

51
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,579
11:04.

52
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,262
Thank you.

53
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,701
Yes, l know it's her birthday.

54
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,457
We'll celebrate tomorrow.
l have to stay.

55
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,145
How old is the girl now?

56
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:16,856
Ten.

57
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,064
Go home.
l'll see to them.

58
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,825
Keep me a piece of cake.

59
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,018
Abadie, you can go too.

60
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:00,936
Right.

61
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,662
We'll pick it up in the morning.

62
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,417
Orléans,
Saint-Pierre-des-Corps and Tours.

63
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,543
Express, 1st and 2nd class.

64
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:32,065
- l didn't see you.
- Or recognise me? Here.

65
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,385
What sign are you?

66
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:43,186
- Where can l drop you?
- Straight on.

67
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,746
You come from Paris
to do shop windows at night?

68
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,597
Got anything against the night?

69
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,407
Leave me here.
l've a window to do.

70
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,336
Goodbye.

71
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:45,906
Why are you following me?
To spy on me?

72
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,500
No, it's silly. l...

73
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,464
l don't quite know why.

74
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,223
l never want to see you again.

75
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,144
l want you more and more.

76
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:26,982
Hey, you, stop!

77
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,936
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

78
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,860
What's going on?

79
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,742
Wait. Stop!

80
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:39,307
- What did you do?
- lt went off on its own.

81
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:52,819
Never touch this weapon again.
lt's not a toy.

82
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,587
You're not a little girl!

83
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,102
Shit, my pen.

84
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,417
Go back, if you're brave enough.

85
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,466
You're angry.

86
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:12,505
Here, man.
And don't you lose it.

87
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,340
lt's Japanese, totally automatic.

88
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:23,982
Wait!

89
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,705
l want your most expensive pen.

90
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,617
But l can give you a discount.

91
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,056
There.

92
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,506
No, it's ugly.

93
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:00,385
You think that's ugly?

94
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,259
lt's the best l've seen.

95
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,256
"l've been thinking a lot.

96
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:11,978
"l'm going toleave you..."

97
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,347
To Mr Victor Ganay.

98
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:26,185
l forgot the tools
to repair this handle.

99
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:36,139
Writing to me?

100
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,104
l felt like writing to you.

101
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,786
- l'm hungry.
- l've got what you like.

102
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,346
l'm a bastard.

103
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:58,896
What?

104
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,785
Old and selfish.

105
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,536
Here.

106
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:10,780
l'm blocking you.

107
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:14,784
Because of me,
you can't see who you like.

108
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:17,103
Why? Don't l look happy?

109
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,466
Open the drawer.

110
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,981
Thank you.

111
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,346
lt's beautiful.

112
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,026
Hello, darling.

113
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,304
l want your frank opinion.

114
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,101
The policemen are talking
of striking.

115
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:41,666
What do you think?

116
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,139
lsn't it a bit much?

117
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,782
Well, a few months to retirement.

118
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:52,976
Yes.

119
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:57,577
We have to reply
about the holiday house.

120
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,065
l like it.

121
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,337
Have you talked to Silvia about it?

122
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,425
No, not yet.

123
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:11,620
Writing to you again?

124
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:21,541
Blue period, pink period,
black period.

125
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,377
lt stops and starts.

126
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:29,103
l know her backwards.

127
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,422
But l like her.

128
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:40,577
No one would've done
what you've done for her.

129
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:45,418
This is the first time
l've felt good in Paris.

130
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:46,986
Spare a coin?

131
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,977
- Are you hurt?
- Bunch of pricks!

132
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,222
You could have hurt her.

133
00:22:58,507 --> 00:22:59,906
What's wrong?

134
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,745
What's wrong? Tell me.

135
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,784
lt's foryou, Marc.

136
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
No, it's lovely...

137
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:10,947
You don't like it.

138
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:12,936
Of course l do.

139
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:16,304
The only jewellery l've had
was an ankle chain.

140
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,698
At the orphanage,
l was almost called "Fer au pied".

141
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,142
Luckily they shortened it to Ferrot.

142
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:25,538
Even Ferrot's a tough name
for a kid...

143
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,864
l want to live with you.

144
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:58,137
Tell me if there's someone
in your life.

145
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:00,020
Nobody.

146
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:04,424
Then why look like
you're trying to hide someone?

147
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:06,897
We can go out together in Orléans.

148
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,625
l'm sick of cops!

149
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:11,096
What have cops got to do with this?

150
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,064
You're asking me questions.

151
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:17,745
Look... l've obeyed you,
l've never tried to find out anything...

152
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:21,256
And that?

153
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,465
ls that his time?

154
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,345
lt's all easy for you.

155
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,702
You judge mistakes. Catch thieves.

156
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,903
And always rely on yourself.

157
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,786
- Yes.
- See? You don't trust anyone.

158
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,016
That's true.

159
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:36,578
But with you, it's different.

160
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:37,816
So...

161
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:41,142
Let's stop. l don't want us to row.

162
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:44,663
We'll go home and you can call
when you've decided?

163
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,056
lt's for you.

164
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:25,616
Silvia.

165
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,656
Yes.
Of course l'm well.

166
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:50,783
ls that why you called?

167
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:55,065
That's nice. Take care.

168
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,745
She calls you here now?

169
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:12,136
Where from?

170
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:13,696
Her place.

171
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:19,178
You're still sure no one knows
about you two?

172
00:27:20,027 --> 00:27:24,100
l know a few who'd be
only too pleased to catch you

173
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,019
and create a scandal.

174
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:28,065
This close to retirement,

175
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,417
it'd be silly.
- No one knows.

176
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:33,944
And your hotel?
La Grenouillére?

177
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:38,260
Don't start, Thérése.
l took her once.

178
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:39,860
So long ago.

179
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,224
See how simple it is.

180
00:28:06,347 --> 00:28:07,416
Not at all.

181
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,100
Give me another week.

182
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:22,504
Why make a date, then?
To piss me off?

183
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:30,746
l beg your pardon.

184
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,837
Riviére 18 to Germaine.
Leaving the network.

185
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:21,586
l've a vicious migraine.
See you tomorrow.

186
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,017
Can't you be careful?

187
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:18,096
You're not allowed on the grass.

188
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,997
You know where l live now.

189
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,666
Happy?

190
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:46,815
l love you.

191
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:13,065
For the last time, come with me.

192
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:44,538
The only thing the bastards
don't lose is money!

193
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:46,785
Pussy, pussy, pussy...

194
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:56,145
l bought you some foie gras.
Shall l make toast?

195
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:57,946
- Wait. l'll do it.
- No.

196
00:31:57,947 --> 00:32:01,297
- l can see you're tired.
- No, l went to the cinema.

197
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,662
You drink Ricard with water.

198
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:54,547
l'd like to see you walk out of here.

199
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,066
Not hungry any more?

200
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:04,745
l owe you everything.

201
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:07,626
l don't want thanks,
l want the truth!

202
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:11,217
Tell me.
Maybe l can do something.

203
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:12,287
Not this time.

204
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:17,384
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

205
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:19,938
You're lying. l've seen you.

206
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,818
From the window, earlier.

207
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:25,896
Who is it?

208
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:29,019
- ls he threatening you?
- What next!

209
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,178
And this?
He scares you!

210
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,663
You scare me.

211
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:43,025
You're always nice.

212
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:47,061
You're good. Few would do
what you do for your wife.

213
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:48,620
For my peace of mind.

214
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,377
- And for me?
- For my pleasure.

215
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,864
- You're impeccable.
- l was wrong, of course.

216
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:59,498
- Stop accusing yourself!
- l know it must hurt.

217
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,420
- Stop understanding!
- lf it helps.

218
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:06,097
l don't want help,
l'm fed up of help!

219
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:11,016
There!

220
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:22,900
lt's always us.

221
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:26,407
The ones who love things in life.
l love my pigs.

222
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,103
l made 2000 last month.

223
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:33,007
But it's failing too.
You can't rely on anything.

224
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,901
Yes. There's someone else.

225
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:41,180
- l'll give myself completely.
- Good, Silvia.

226
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:44,727
- And l want him completely.
- As you wish. Of course.

227
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:47,700
Maybe you can rent us a room!

228
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,016
Why not?

229
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,942
Nothing stops you.

230
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:55,857
l want what's good for you.

231
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,739
You're disgusting.

232
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:11,176
l'd rather you hit me.
Even that!

233
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:12,581
You see?

234
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:27,304
"1.30. Sorry. l'll love you always.

235
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,185
"M."

236
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,705
Evening, lout.

237
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:48,779
Don't l get a kiss?

238
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,746
She left you, eh?

239
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,376
She's dead.

240
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:13,139
Shut the door.

241
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:15,946
Shut the door!

242
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:46,385
l hit her.

243
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:49,457
l don't know what got into me.

244
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:52,539
That phrase...

245
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:58,500
You've heard it so many times
and never tried to understand.

246
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,105
Fetch a pillow.

247
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:20,576
No, in the chest of drawers.

248
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:34,025
Sit down.

249
00:43:36,987 --> 00:43:38,306
No, here.

250
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:48,935
With a weapon?

251
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:50,426
An ashtray.

252
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,265
What did you do with it?

253
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:54,977
l threw it in the Loire.

254
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,866
lt's odd.

255
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:02,936
l almost stood up earlier.

256
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,897
lt's best l confess tomorrow.

257
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:11,060
Were you seen?

258
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,264
l saw a light.

259
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:16,496
Who was it?

260
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,385
l just saw a light.

261
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:27,619
lf nothing happens in the next hour,
why admit it?

262
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:30,900
l don't understand.

263
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,059
Either you were seen,

264
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:36,937
and by now it's all underway...

265
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:38,626
or you weren't seen.

266
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,659
This next hourwill be the hardest.

267
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:49,576
Because maybe this chap
with the light you mentioned

268
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:53,575
only exists in your head.

269
00:44:55,587 --> 00:44:56,940
l wish.

270
00:44:57,107 --> 00:45:00,258
You must sleep.
Pass me that little bottle.

271
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,737
l liked Silvia.

272
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:54,940
Hi, Ménard.

273
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:57,146
No, not very well.

274
00:46:57,307 --> 00:47:00,299
l feel terrible.
lt's probably flu.

275
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,977
l'll see a doctor this morning.

276
00:47:03,227 --> 00:47:06,583
Yes, l've a very good one.
Yes, he's seen me before.

277
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:08,656
What?

278
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,546
A murder?

279
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:15,537
Start without me.
l'll see you in the office at noon.

280
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:16,901
Goodbye.

281
00:47:52,947 --> 00:47:55,347
Silvia Leopardi.
8, square des Tilleuls.

282
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:58,340
Probably instantaneous death.
Skull shattered.

283
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,699
Ménard will be back by noon.

284
00:48:05,947 --> 00:48:07,221
l know, thank you.

285
00:49:01,907 --> 00:49:04,107
- Your files are ready.
- Thank you.

286
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,986
Put Ménard on.

287
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:09,617
He's not here, sir,
Michel's replacing him.

288
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:11,906
Hello?

289
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,864
No. Nothing.

290
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:24,407
- Ferrot for Mr Ganay.
- Mr Ganay is in a meeting.

291
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:26,977
- l want him now.
- l can't contact him.

292
00:49:27,027 --> 00:49:29,106
For how long?
l need to see him.

293
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:31,098
ln... half an hour.

294
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:32,666
l'll be there.

295
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,984
Mr Ganay is waiting.

296
00:49:46,227 --> 00:49:49,742
Well! Didn't your doctor
sign you off, looking like that?

297
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:53,146
l've the killer's glove, shoes,
and a letter signed M.

298
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,945
- l've a full description.
- Sit down.

299
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:59,257
This is last night's murder?

300
00:49:59,427 --> 00:50:02,942
And l've evidence.
Not to mention what's at the lab.

301
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:06,107
The murderer left zigzag
mud tracks on the floor.

302
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:09,777
l recognised the design.
l called in at home.

303
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,417
Here are the zigzags.

304
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,739
Ferrot and l bought a pair
two months ago.

305
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:18,944
They were in a sale at Myris,
Rue Royale.

306
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:22,298
Ourfirst witness
mentioned pale shoes.

307
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:23,422
What witness?

308
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:26,427
An old woman who feeds
the local cats.

309
00:50:26,587 --> 00:50:29,499
She saw someone running.
The time matches.

310
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,898
He dropped a glove.
She picked it up.

311
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:34,586
lt's this one.

312
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:37,147
- And the weapon?
- We don't know yet.

313
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:40,537
But the killer is a violent man,
he smashed her skull.

314
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:41,727
We've his letter.

315
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,357
"Sorry. l'll always love you."

316
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:46,900
Signed "M".

317
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:48,626
Same time: 1:30.

318
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,317
We've the victim's letter.

319
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,219
"l'm going to leave you."

320
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:57,745
No visible break-in.
Neighbours heard nothing.

321
00:50:57,907 --> 00:51:01,343
A break-in that turns bad,
he flees without precaution.

322
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:04,338
We're not hopeful about prints.

323
00:51:04,507 --> 00:51:07,704
The cleaner had dusted
before finding the body.

324
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:09,786
How's yourflu?

325
00:51:10,707 --> 00:51:12,698
Good, you'll head the inquiry.

326
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:15,176
l've asked Paris for information.

327
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:19,417
The victim has lived here 5 years,
the tenants said.

328
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:21,579
First, find out who with,

329
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,583
obviously.

330
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:26,262
The tenants saw no one, anyway.
Nor the cleaning woman.

331
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:29,226
l'll trace her employers
from pay slips.

332
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,787
You wanted a word.
Was it this?

333
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,706
Yes, he's here.

334
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,023
Lemblin?

335
00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:51,575
Thank you.

336
00:51:52,347 --> 00:51:55,498
Here, Ferrot.
A second eye-witness.

337
00:51:56,347 --> 00:52:00,056
He talked to a man following
the victim. He's waiting.

338
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:04,221
lf catwoman's description matches,
then there's no mistake.

339
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,786
Good luck.

340
00:52:26,347 --> 00:52:29,817
Thérése.
lt wasn't in my head.

341
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:45,460
Take the wheel.

342
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:05,657
lt's here.

343
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:08,182
You go,
l'm off to the chemist's.

344
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:11,197
l'll meet you at the bistro
in half an hour.

345
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:12,621
OK.

346
00:53:23,987 --> 00:53:26,637
Mr Lemblin is out,
he'll be half an hour.

347
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,786
Oh. Tell him l'm waiting
in the café next door.

348
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:31,743
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.

349
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:51,466
lnspector?

350
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:53,660
Hello. Mr Lemblin.

351
00:53:53,827 --> 00:53:55,385
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

352
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:58,146
You have a statement to make
about last night?

353
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:01,901
lt was around midnight.
l was walking Joséphine,

354
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,096
my dog.

355
00:54:16,627 --> 00:54:19,016
How farfrom him were you?

356
00:54:19,907 --> 00:54:21,943
About 20 metres.

357
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,027
- Who's that?
- My boss.

358
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:33,906
Excuse me.

359
00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:38,700
Looks like the same guy.

360
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:42,655
But as he was hiding, Mr Lemblin
didn't really see his face.

361
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,939
Two identical descriptions
around the same time.

362
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:48,418
Obviously he was her lover.

363
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:52,257
How could she never
have talked about me?

364
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:54,986
Partitions.

365
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:57,384
Compartmentalisation.

366
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,096
The principle that prevents sinking.

367
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:04,781
He hit her because she wouldn't tell.

368
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:08,266
And she wouldn't tell you either.

369
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:10,786
Partitions.

370
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:13,437
But he might have seen me.

371
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:17,303
So why's he saying nothing?
What's he waiting for?

372
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,938
lf appearances are against him,

373
00:55:20,107 --> 00:55:22,780
he'll look to inform
without compromise.

374
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:24,860
He'll say nothing.

375
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:28,837
Because he has nothing to say.

376
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:30,865
He didn't see you.

377
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,987
You don't realise how lucky we are.

378
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:36,976
He's the guilty one.

379
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:40,421
Don't go. Please don't go.

380
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,887
l want to tell them.

381
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:45,781
There's no clue against you,
no link to you.

382
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:50,065
Someone switched on a light.
Someone breathed on the phone.

383
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:53,617
You'll find this someone
on the phone in the end.

384
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:57,065
lfhe saw something,
then he's dangerous.

385
00:57:58,147 --> 00:58:00,103
But you'll know before he does.

386
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:03,743
So if he really did see something,

387
00:58:06,907 --> 00:58:08,499
we'll act.

388
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,061
We'll have to.

389
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,459
Take off your hat.

390
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:28,023
Sometimes when l'm pondering God,

391
00:58:28,307 --> 00:58:30,502
l think: "God is immobile."

392
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,500
And he's right.

393
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:38,295
- Did she take the photos?
- Yes. They're very good.

394
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:42,939
ln fact l kept them all.
ln my shed in the courtyard.

395
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:57,437
- lnspector Ménard.
- Someone's in there.

396
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:08,106
l didn't know...

397
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:10,906
l'm first everywhere.
l waited for you.

398
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:12,864
l said l'd cover the shops.

399
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,819
They don't open till 9.

400
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,023
l've found nothing here.

401
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,179
The furrier said
he saw nobody with the victim.

402
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:23,384
l reckon it'll be the same
with all the others.

403
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:24,866
l'll be going.

404
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,785
When will you see the flat?

405
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:30,099
No. Send all her things
to the police station.

406
00:59:30,307 --> 00:59:32,104
lt'll simplify our task.

407
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:44,656
"Leopardi Silvia Magdalena.

408
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:47,945
"born December 25, 1945,
in Agrigente, Sicily.

409

Disowned when she came of age.

414
01:00:04,987 --> 01:00:06,943
Paris is sending the rest.

415
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:12,577
We're looking for a lover.
l see him as more of a pimp.

416
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,018
This girl wasn't a whore.

417
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:17,140
Why not?

418
01:00:17,507 --> 01:00:18,906
She had a good job.

419
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:21,103
You get high-class whores too.

420
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,861
l'm sorry you didn't see herflat.

421
01:00:24,947 --> 01:00:26,460
lt's all downstairs.

422
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:40,419
A pretty girl with no jewellery.
Strange.

423
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:43,545
You've been over everything?

424
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,779
Yes, there's nothing there.

425
01:00:45,947 --> 01:00:48,647
She wasn't killed for that.
We found money.

426
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,258
That must be a gift.

427
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:57,147
There's an address.

428
01:00:57,267 --> 01:00:58,302
lt's a cinch.

429
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:01,743
No. l'll take the dresses,
you take the furniture.

430
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:03,778
Abadie, see about the objects.

431
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:08,696
lt's stamped Gustave Moreau Museum.

432
01:01:09,427 --> 01:01:11,383
l'll pop up to Paris.

433
01:01:11,987 --> 01:01:15,138
Her killer wasn't
the only man in her life.

434
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:26,340
All the furniture
was ordered by mail.

435
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:29,697
She had an alarm clock in her bag.
They argued.

436
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:31,699
A big hostile-looking chap.

437
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:34,098
- She came alone?
- Yes, always.

438
01:01:34,347 --> 01:01:39,182
Brunette, hazel eyes, grey jacket.
l'd recognise him easily.

439
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:40,527
Yes, always alone.

440
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:45,305
- What's wrong? What did l say?
- Thank you.

441
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:49,417
Silvia Leopardi was always seen
alone or with the same man

442
01:01:49,507 --> 01:01:51,099
we're starting to profile

443
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:54,717
and who matches the description
of the man at the scene.

444
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:59,625
Six feet tall,
dark hair and eyes, well-built.

445
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:03,619
Seen arguing
at the Gustave Moreau Museum.

446
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,783
The guard mentioned an alarm clock.

447
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:09,647
The one we found at the victim's.

448
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:11,943
- The same.
- Why the same?

449
01:02:15,227 --> 01:02:18,981
lt just is.
We only found one alarm clock.

450
01:02:19,787 --> 01:02:21,664
Ménard thinks he's a pimp.

451
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:23,778
Who takes her to the museum?

452
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,657
A high-class pimp?

453
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,097
- From Orléans.
- Why?

454
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:31,461
Why indeed?

455
01:02:32,067 --> 01:02:35,457
We'll try to find out.
Put her picture in the papers

456
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,339
and appeal for witnesses.

457
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,207
lt'll scare the killer off.

458
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:40,586
He knows he's wanted.

459
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:41,815
Police seek man...

460
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:42,976
lfhe's local,

461
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:45,860
he didn't want to be seen with her.

462
01:02:46,707 --> 01:02:50,063
They were never seen
under 50 kilometres away.

463
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:51,626
Got a cigarette?

464
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,386
You've started again?

465
01:03:10,027 --> 01:03:11,858
Read me the Paris file again.

466
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,824
"Leopardi Silvia Magdalena.

467
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:22,783
"Arrested 20 December 1968
for drug use.

468
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:26,497
"On leaving prison,

470
01:03:29,187 --> 01:03:33,021
"Silvia Breuil then works as

"protected in hospital, divorce."

473
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:42,862
Then there's a sudden change.
She starts working normally.

474
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:47,180
"Leaves Paris for Orléans.
lrreproachable conduct for 5 years."

475
01:03:48,187 --> 01:03:52,385
When you change that much,
someone has made you change.

476
01:03:52,547 --> 01:03:54,047
That's who interests me.

477
01:03:56,307 --> 01:03:59,265
So we're looking for a gentleman,
not a pimp.

478
01:03:59,427 --> 01:04:03,136
Don't be abstruse, Ménard.
Nobody is 100% good or 100% pimp.

479
01:04:03,787 --> 01:04:07,496
Very effective, the paper number.
You have customers upstairs.

480
01:04:17,747 --> 01:04:19,544
lt'd take 3 people all day.

481
01:04:19,707 --> 01:04:22,175
You see to it.
l've too much work.

482
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:23,917
We do all the work.

483
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,277
Look, we all have our job to do.

484
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:28,303
Check out your gossip mongers.

485
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:30,901
l'll see those
with something to say.

486
01:04:41,187 --> 01:04:44,137
She pretended to come from Paris.
l was closing.

487
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:46,496
She said to the man who met her...

488
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:47,622
Man?

489
01:04:49,307 --> 01:04:50,626
45 years old,

490
01:04:51,627 --> 01:04:52,616
dark.

491
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:57,477
Like a ticket inspector l knew
when l worked on the Brittany line.

492
01:04:57,547 --> 01:05:00,061
His double: double-locked.

493
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:45,066
Awoman saw the victim
and the suspect in a public garden.

494
01:05:45,227 --> 01:05:48,677
They rowed and split up.
Two minutes later, she returned.

495
01:05:48,787 --> 01:05:52,177
He followed her, hiding.
He wanted to kill her then.

496
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:55,847
Come and see. lt fits.
Don't forget the break-up letter.

497
01:05:55,867 --> 01:05:59,177
Hours later, he was still following.
Fine tailing.

498
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:06,347
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing.

499
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:08,857
You finish,
l'll go to the infirmary.

500
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,299
Awitness saw them in his field.
They fired shots.

501
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:17,935
- He saw the man?
- No, just the girl.

502
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,416
Still the same grey 404.

503
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:25,747
- What were they shooting at?
- She shot and killed a pheasant.

504
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:29,706
- Did you find the bullets?
- No! lt was in bits.

505
01:06:29,867 --> 01:06:31,380
No interest.

506
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:34,247
You don't smash pheasant
with just any gun.

507
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:36,702
My 38 would just make a big hole.

508
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,018
A good guy helps her out.
He has a gun, they row.

509
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:44,226
She says she lives in Paris,
he follows her. No, it doesn't fit!

510
01:06:44,387 --> 01:06:45,587
There are two guys.

511
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:49,461
You're sticking to this.
l've just heard of one man!

512
01:06:49,787 --> 01:06:53,575
The guy they all saw
doesn't have to be the murderer!

513
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,117
Who are we looking for?

514
01:06:56,347 --> 01:06:58,178
l know no better than you.

515
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,860
We need to have a confrontation
with you.

516
01:07:08,827 --> 01:07:10,340
A phot0-fit.

517
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:12,215
Yes.

518
01:07:40,187 --> 01:07:41,586
The Alsatian's girl.

519
01:07:42,107 --> 01:07:44,621
Bastard!
Just because he gives me leads.

520
01:07:44,787 --> 01:07:48,143
Quick, to the hospital.
l'll see to the Alsatian.

521
01:08:17,507 --> 01:08:19,304
Hello, inspector.

522
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:28,780
Learnt how to use vitriol now?
No more spattering?

523
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:31,017
What's wrong, inspector?
Problems?

524
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,704
- Bastard!
- What's wrong? Calm down.

525
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:37,757
He's crazy.
Let's get out of here!

526
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:43,377
Come on, hurry.

527
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:44,542
Get in!

528
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:36,106
Stop!

529
01:09:36,747 --> 01:09:37,736
Leave him.

530
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:40,146
He's done nothing.

531
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:44,057
Calm down, for God's sake!
Listen to me.

532
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,584
The girl has come round.

533
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:50,386
One ofher clients did it,
a madman.

534
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:53,547
He told the police everything
when she was found.

535
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:03,257
What got into you?

536
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:07,597
The Alsatian's insinuating things
about you.

537
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:11,026
- Because l was using him?
- Easy, l don't like that.

538
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:12,227
Has he reported me?

539
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:15,504
Not this time.
We calmed him down.

540
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:18,935
Right. And the Leopardi case?

541
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:24,583
René Breuil, her ex-husband.
Questioning revealed nothing.

542
01:10:25,307 --> 01:10:27,946
This is what we have on the suspect.

543
01:10:28,107 --> 01:10:31,304
He had a weapon,
drove a grey 404.

544
01:10:31,587 --> 01:10:34,738
The man and the victim
met secretly in town

545
01:10:35,187 --> 01:10:36,987
but were seen at the station.

546
01:10:37,227 --> 01:10:39,821
The station?
She travelled with him?

547
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,655
No. She pretended
to arrive from Paris.

548
01:10:42,827 --> 01:10:44,499
She was scared of him?

549
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:46,862
Or someone else.

550
01:10:47,027 --> 01:10:49,627
Also a stroll the afternoon
of the murder.

551
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:52,146
They had a big row
in a public garden.

552
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,105
And he was seen tailing her
to herhome.

553
01:10:55,507 --> 01:10:58,624
Well, that's something.
lt's logical. Ajealous guy.

554
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,061
Looking to kill her.

555
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:05,462
Or to find out something.
Was she hiding someone else?

556
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:07,259
Someone else?

557
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:10,586
Take the case offhim.

558
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:13,784
- On what pretext?
- l'm telling you to.

559
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:17,656
He has his intuition.
But there's nothing to find.

560
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:22,022
What if he finds out about
her arrest, with Breuil?

561
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:24,906
You know l met Silvia
a long time later.

562
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:26,466
By chance.

563
01:11:32,307 --> 01:11:34,298
You like this, don't you?

564
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:41,784
Letting Ferrot go like this
is dangerous.

565
01:11:43,987 --> 01:11:45,978
And that's what you like.

566
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:50,376
May l?

567
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:51,986
To Marc.
Sylvia

568
01:17:11,907 --> 01:17:13,898
René Breuil verdict - 20 years

569
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:24,663
A neighbour heard a noise.

570
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:28,097
They entered via the roof.
The seals are intact.

571
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:30,782
What were they looking for?

572
01:18:30,947 --> 01:18:32,221
Maybe nothing.

573
01:18:32,787 --> 01:18:36,336
You'll see the mess.
The work of a madman.

574
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:38,180
Same as the murder.

575
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:40,656
Stop here.
l'll only be 30 seconds.

576
01:18:42,547 --> 01:18:45,380
- Buy some gum for the boy.
- OK.

577
01:18:57,427 --> 01:18:58,780
ln the food section,

578
01:18:59,427 --> 01:19:01,782
pasta with Lustucru sauce.

579
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:04,277
ln one packet, fresh egg pasta

580
01:19:04,427 --> 01:19:07,499
and a fine sauce
prepared by Lustucru.

581
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:37,262
He's been seen in the store.

582
01:21:37,427 --> 01:21:39,463
A guy called us from gate 1.

583
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:40,423
Who called?

584
01:21:40,587 --> 01:21:42,817
The ticket inspector we interviewed.

585
01:21:42,987 --> 01:21:44,137
l didn't see him.

586
01:21:44,787 --> 01:21:47,687
- Let's hope it's not a joke.
- Cash desk 25.

587
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:50,257
Check the checkouts.
You, block the exits.

588
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:54,139
Look at customers, me?

589
01:22:21,307 --> 01:22:24,504
An abandoned trolley.
He must have tailed him.

590
01:22:25,147 --> 01:22:28,105
You stay here.
Take all their details.

591
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,175
Yes, Ménard?

592
01:23:15,867 --> 01:23:18,859
The supermarket witness
was the ticket inspector.

593
01:23:19,187 --> 01:23:20,586
He's in hospital.

594
01:23:21,147 --> 01:23:22,747
The suspect hit him twice.

595
01:23:23,107 --> 01:23:25,780
Warn all witnesses
to watch themselves.

596
01:23:26,827 --> 01:23:27,976
Has he talked?

597
01:23:28,147 --> 01:23:31,583
No. The doctors won't let us
talk to him till noon.

598
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:34,504
Right. Noon?

599
01:23:37,347 --> 01:23:39,781
You could have called, Ménard.

600
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:44,583
l'm picking up Etienne
from catechism...

601
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:48,979
Sorry to have bothered you.

602
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,018
Don't forget: noon tomorrow.

603
01:25:42,307 --> 01:25:46,539
Calling all cars.
occupation of the Delmotte plant.

604
01:25:46,707 --> 01:25:49,096
Fight between pickets and security.

605
01:26:01,747 --> 01:26:04,978
Riviére 18 to Germaine.
Put Ménard on.

606
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:09,345
Ferrot? Where have you been?
We can just get to the hospital.

607
01:26:09,507 --> 01:26:12,385
The inspector remembers the guy
perfectly.

608
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:15,506
- l'll call at Delmotte first.
- There are men there.

609
01:26:15,507 --> 01:26:17,586
lt's on my way.
l'll be on time.

610
01:26:17,587 --> 01:26:19,066
As you wish.

611
01:26:37,947 --> 01:26:40,047
1.5 million unemployed
is enough.!

612
01:26:42,067 --> 01:26:45,567
- Let me see the boss.
- He's being held. No one enters.

613
01:26:51,107 --> 01:26:52,426
Where is he?

614
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:54,578
We're waiting on x-rays.

615
01:26:56,707 --> 01:26:59,267
- What was he up to?
- How do l know?

616
01:26:59,427 --> 01:27:02,146
l was upstairs
with the supermarket witness.

617
01:27:02,307 --> 01:27:04,207
He's never where he should be.

618
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:07,305
- He's always been like that.
- Not this bad!

619
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:09,637
lt's the Leopardi case.

620
01:27:09,747 --> 01:27:12,944
He's hell-bent on his theory
of the second man.

621
01:27:13,107 --> 01:27:17,257
Two lovers hiding doesn't imply
a third party. lt could be anything.

622
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:20,577
- He's found nothing yet?
- How do l know?

623
01:27:20,747 --> 01:27:23,136
l'm bringing up the rear!

624
01:27:23,627 --> 01:27:25,185
He wants you out?

625
01:27:25,467 --> 01:27:27,867
We've never been
to the flat together.

626
01:27:28,027 --> 01:27:31,227
He won't see witnesses
or come to the confrontation.

627
01:27:31,267 --> 01:27:33,178
Sorry, sir, but l'm sick ofit!

628
01:27:34,787 --> 01:27:37,096
The suspect is tidying up
behind him!

629
01:27:37,267 --> 01:27:39,576
Calm down, we'll sort it out.

630
01:27:40,027 --> 01:27:42,177
No, Mr Ganay, still nothing.

631
01:27:42,347 --> 01:27:43,939
But l'm listening.

632
01:27:44,187 --> 01:27:46,826
Why did a second man change her life?

633
01:27:46,987 --> 01:27:48,978
Why not our suspect?

634
01:27:49,147 --> 01:27:52,219
- There are two.
- lt's becoming an obsession!

635
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:55,345
There's a suspect.
Let's investigate properly.

636
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:56,822
Fine, sir.

637
01:27:56,987 --> 01:27:58,937
Get up when the doctors say so.

638
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:06,900
Thank you, sir.

639
01:28:10,147 --> 01:28:14,584
Ménard, until our friend is better,
you will replace him.

640
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:15,975
Very good, sir.

641
01:28:16,587 --> 01:28:19,147
l'm fine. Let me carry on, sir.

642
01:28:21,347 --> 01:28:23,144
Rest. That's an order.

643
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:30,585
So Silvia gave him my watch

644
01:28:30,747 --> 01:28:34,296
so you'd understand
that it was over.

645
01:28:35,187 --> 01:28:36,859
Him, Ferrot!

646
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:38,096
Yes.

647
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,506
Of course.

648
01:28:41,227 --> 01:28:43,218
Another orphan, like her.

649
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:44,456
And a cop.

650
01:28:44,627 --> 01:28:46,777
Oh, she attracted cops.

651
01:28:47,347 --> 01:28:49,338
She couldn't do without them.

652
01:28:53,147 --> 01:28:57,937
Good. lt'll be easier for you
to get rid ofhim.

653
01:28:58,187 --> 01:29:00,621
Yes, he'll be easier to confound.

654
01:29:00,787 --> 01:29:02,106
l didn't say that.

655
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:06,062
You're right, Thérése,
but everything points to him.

656
01:29:06,587 --> 01:29:08,976
Description, silence, weapon,

657
01:29:09,187 --> 01:29:10,237
the supermarket...

658
01:29:10,347 --> 01:29:12,144
Yes, but he is innocent.

659
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:15,827
So what? He won't be the first
to claim his innocence.

660
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:20,464
You're so sure of yourself?

661
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:27,858
Silvia hid from you,
she hid from him...

662
01:29:28,587 --> 01:29:31,055
she had a taste for the trigger.

663
01:29:32,387 --> 01:29:36,460
So when he scoured the flat,
turning it upside down,

664
01:29:37,987 --> 01:29:40,217
he may have found something.

665
01:29:40,587 --> 01:29:42,384
l'll find out tonight.

666
01:29:42,547 --> 01:29:46,859
l'll tell him l'm parading him
before witnesses. He's finished.

667
01:29:58,507 --> 01:29:59,496
Ménard? Ganay.

668
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:02,176
l want all witnesses in tomorrow.

669
01:30:02,347 --> 01:30:05,657
Those you can find.
We've wasted enough time.

670
01:30:06,147 --> 01:30:08,377
Yes, lnspector Ferrot will be there.

671
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:34,659
You're a blockhead.

672
01:30:35,467 --> 01:30:37,017
l was coming to see you.

673
01:30:37,507 --> 01:30:38,496
Get in.

674
01:30:52,027 --> 01:30:53,665
l feel sorry for you.

675
01:30:54,227 --> 01:30:56,477
Tomorrow,
everyone will recognise you.

676
01:30:58,387 --> 01:31:01,587
l ordered the confrontation
that you sought to avoid.

677
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:11,105
- When did you twig?
- At the supermarket.

678
01:31:13,107 --> 01:31:15,905
- l didn't kill her.
- So why say nothing?

679
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:19,667
l was scared and wanted the culprit.

680
01:31:20,347 --> 01:31:22,597
lf l talked, l'd be thrown in jail.

681
01:31:23,027 --> 01:31:25,416
l'd be unable to defend myself.

682
01:31:25,587 --> 01:31:27,487
We could have searched for you.

683
01:31:27,547 --> 01:31:30,380
Mr Ganay, l was taught
to fend for myself.

684
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:32,378
Mitigating circumstances?

685
01:31:32,547 --> 01:31:34,847
- l didn't kill her.
- Then who did?

686
01:31:35,147 --> 01:31:36,136
The other man.

687
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:37,786
l have to arrest you.

688
01:31:37,947 --> 01:31:40,415
Look, give me a few days. Look.

689
01:31:40,747 --> 01:31:41,941
Look.

690
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:44,983
l found this at her place.

691
01:31:45,147 --> 01:31:47,980
And l'll find this house, behind.

692
01:31:48,147 --> 01:31:51,047
- What for?
- l want the man who was with her.

693
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:53,266
She's alone on the photo.

694
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:56,304
No. A hidden, repaired photo
meant something.

695
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:57,906
Sorry, but you're raving.

696
01:31:57,907 --> 01:32:00,944
No, it's a memory.
And memories take two.

697
01:32:01,827 --> 01:32:04,136
Someone had to take this photo.

698
01:32:06,747 --> 01:32:10,456
l have to take my wife her medicine.
Wait for me.

699
01:32:10,627 --> 01:32:12,345
We'll talk at more length.

700
01:32:28,787 --> 01:32:32,143
No. l'm just taking my wife
her medicine.

701
01:32:32,467 --> 01:32:33,866
l won't be long.

702
01:32:54,907 --> 01:32:57,407
Ferrot found a photo
of the country inn.

703
01:32:57,587 --> 01:32:59,976
l don't know who took it.
A guest.

704
01:33:00,507 --> 01:33:02,896
Silvia laughed all day long.

705
01:33:03,187 --> 01:33:05,985
We only went to La Grenouillére once.

706
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,978
My car's on the photo.

707
01:33:08,147 --> 01:33:09,216
The Nash.

708
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:13,255
A Nash. l'm the only one
in the department to have had one.

709
01:33:13,707 --> 01:33:15,907
Luckily it was before Ferrot arrived.

710
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:18,337
He's never seen me with it.

711
01:33:22,107 --> 01:33:23,176
But first,

712
01:33:23,747 --> 01:33:26,420
l want him to declare
that he knew Silvia.

713
01:33:26,587 --> 01:33:30,296
lt's a Polaroid, there's no negative.
No more evidence...

714
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:50,865
l'll give you three days.

715
01:33:52,147 --> 01:33:53,899
But tit for tat.

716
01:34:07,107 --> 01:34:09,780
l said nothing
because everything damned me.

717
01:34:12,227 --> 01:34:14,422
l know that girls like her exist.

718
01:34:14,787 --> 01:34:16,379
lt's too complicated.

719
01:34:16,867 --> 01:34:18,459
lt's not for me.

720
01:34:19,907 --> 01:34:21,898
lt's another world, you see.

721
01:34:22,307 --> 01:34:24,741
Aworld others have as kids.

722
01:34:25,907 --> 01:34:27,306
Oh, l don't know!

723
01:34:41,027 --> 01:34:42,506
My photo.

724
01:34:47,587 --> 01:34:49,179
Why are you doing that?

725
01:34:49,987 --> 01:34:52,979
- Why?
- l loved her.

726
01:34:54,827 --> 01:34:55,816
You killed her?

727
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:03,087
l knew you'd be there.
l didn't even call the hospital.

728
01:36:03,627 --> 01:36:07,700
They waited till you were in bed
to get things moving.

729
01:36:08,467 --> 01:36:11,345
Tomorrow it's the confrontation
with witnesses.

730
01:36:11,627 --> 01:36:12,616
At 11 o'clock.

731
01:36:12,827 --> 01:36:14,226
l'll be there.

732
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:53,220
- Evening, Mr Ferrot.
- Evening, Abadie.

733
01:36:54,987 --> 01:36:59,503
- l'll prepare for tomorrow.
- 11 o'clock. We'll get our man.

734
01:40:42,467 --> 01:40:44,717
- Where were you tonight?
- What now?

735
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:47,306
- Where were you?
- Shit, you're worse than Ferrot.

736
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:50,299
At a Free French banquet.
l have 40 witnesses.

737
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:52,856
We've just found Mr Ganay's body.

738
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:54,277
l don't believe it!

739
01:40:56,427 --> 01:40:57,416
And Ferrot?

740
01:40:57,587 --> 01:41:00,260
He's OK.
But he said he saw nothing.

741
01:41:00,467 --> 01:41:02,822
What about
the Leopardi confrontation?

742
01:41:02,987 --> 01:41:04,136
Cancel it!

743
01:41:21,627 --> 01:41:22,855
lnspector Ménard.

744
01:41:23,027 --> 01:41:25,825
Valois. Paris has put me in charge.

745
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,864
The accuracy points to
a professional gunman.

746
01:41:32,027 --> 01:41:35,144
l agree.
And it's a 357.

747
01:41:37,187 --> 01:41:39,303
Coming here, armed...

748
01:41:39,787 --> 01:41:41,982
What could they have offered him?

749
01:41:43,787 --> 01:41:45,300
Tell me...

750
01:41:48,187 --> 01:41:49,336
Ganay...

751
01:41:50,987 --> 01:41:55,105
Three private cars, a second home
in the South of France

752
01:41:55,627 --> 01:41:57,177
on a chief super's wage.

753
01:41:57,267 --> 01:42:01,340
lt's all his wife's, a Cléry.
An old local family.

754
01:42:01,787 --> 01:42:05,143
- Has she been questioned?
- Yes. She knows nothing.

755
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:10,415
l asked the secret service
for Ganay's political past.

756
01:43:09,787 --> 01:43:10,856
You're tired.

757
01:43:11,507 --> 01:43:12,986
You must sleep.

758
01:43:25,387 --> 01:43:26,297
So...

759
01:43:27,987 --> 01:43:31,287
l've gone over it so much
l don't know where l am.

760
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,837
lt's been weeks,
we don't remember.

761
01:43:35,027 --> 01:43:36,301
l haven't forgotten.

762
01:43:36,547 --> 01:43:37,616
That's it.

763
01:43:37,867 --> 01:43:39,220
A parting...

764
01:43:41,107 --> 01:43:43,257
Thick hair...

765
01:43:46,947 --> 01:43:48,426
More than this?

766
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:52,180
l'm talking to you.

767
01:43:52,507 --> 01:43:54,577
ls the hair like this or not?

768
01:43:55,467 --> 01:43:56,866
l can't recall.

769
01:43:59,187 --> 01:44:01,906
"My sincere condolences."

770
01:44:09,947 --> 01:44:12,097
Ask for the car, please.

771
01:44:13,067 --> 01:44:15,067
l have to go to the lake house.

772
01:44:15,227 --> 01:44:16,455
Very good, madame.

773
01:44:37,587 --> 01:44:40,465
Your colleague...
what happened to him?

774
01:44:40,627 --> 01:44:41,977
Burned in an accident.

775
01:44:42,107 --> 01:44:44,621
- Long ago?
- No. Why?

776
01:44:44,787 --> 01:44:47,255
He looks tricky. Double-locked.

777
01:45:26,107 --> 01:45:27,707
lt's getting dark, madame.

778
01:45:40,387 --> 01:45:42,776
Pierrot, stop at my chemist's.

779
01:45:43,467 --> 01:45:45,742
Pick up this prescription, please.

780
01:45:46,107 --> 01:45:47,176
Thank you.

781
01:47:38,547 --> 01:47:39,697
Get in, Mr Ferrot.

782
01:47:42,587 --> 01:47:43,656
Get in.

783
01:47:51,747 --> 01:47:53,100
Please...

784
01:49:24,347 --> 01:49:25,416
Was it here?

785
01:49:30,627 --> 01:49:32,982
Did you come or did he bring you?

786
01:49:34,027 --> 01:49:35,142
He did.

787
01:49:38,227 --> 01:49:40,616
Now we must finish what was started.

788
01:49:42,707 --> 01:49:44,777
l tried, l tried.

789
01:49:45,387 --> 01:49:46,706
l can't.

790
01:49:47,347 --> 01:49:49,099
Yet l'm already dead.

791
01:49:52,107 --> 01:49:53,699
Yes, l'm dead.

792
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:57,387
l'd have spoken up if not,
since l know everything.

793
01:49:57,907 --> 01:50:01,616
l know you didn't kill Silvia,
l know you killed Ganay.

794
01:50:03,467 --> 01:50:05,776
And l'd have lied a bit, because...

795
01:50:06,187 --> 01:50:09,657
l lied well when l was alive.
So now...

796
01:50:10,747 --> 01:50:13,420
you've disfigured yourself
for nothing.

797
01:50:15,907 --> 01:50:17,704
So l'm begging you...

798
01:50:18,187 --> 01:50:20,337
Please, help me.

799
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:24,545
Help me.
Everyone'll believe it was suicide.

800
01:50:25,107 --> 01:50:26,904
Please.

801
01:51:08,307 --> 01:51:10,616
Chief Superintendent Valois?

802
01:51:10,787 --> 01:51:14,621
lnspector Ménard.
Sorry to call late, but it's urgent.

803
01:51:14,787 --> 01:51:17,017
l must speak to your husband now.

804
01:51:17,187 --> 01:51:20,145
What?
He's at the station at this hour?

805
01:51:20,307 --> 01:51:23,026
ln his office?
Right, l'm on my way.

806
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:25,237
Thank you and sorry again, madame.

807
01:52:59,667 --> 01:53:01,419
l was just coming for you.

808
01:53:01,587 --> 01:53:04,386
- l want to see Valois.
- He sent me for you.

809
01:53:04,387 --> 01:53:09,177
There's a hold-up at the supermarket.
