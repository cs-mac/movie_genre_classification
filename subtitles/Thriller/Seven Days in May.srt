1
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:08,824
Lyman lovers!

2
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,201
Give me a hand! Give me a hand!

3
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,432
Come on, break it up! Hey, break it up!

4
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,770
Push him in.

5
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:39,718
When it comes to jurisdictional strikes
like this...

6
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:42,118
...the administration's job is quite clear.

7
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,022
The 0-day cooling off period
will be observed.

8
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:48,160
And if industry is so hell bent
to invoke Taft-Hartley...

9
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:51,061
...any support they get from me
will have to get flogged out.

10
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,225
Underline and exclamation point.
How many men involved there?

11
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:58,704
By next Tuesday, they figure the entire
industry from San Diego to Seattle.

12
00:04:58,772 --> 00:04:59,898
I'm not through yet.

13
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,909
You stick one more thing in me, Horace,
and I'll take up faith healing.

14
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:05,376
You've been at it an hour.

15
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:08,414
Your pressure's risen three points
for every letter you've dictated.

16
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,313
Your predecessors would go to the clinic.

17
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,910
My predecessors didn't have a riot
going on outside the White House.

18
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,586
They were at least sufficiently popular
to get their faces on stamps.

19
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,887
"Gallup Poll."

20
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:24,824
Twenty-nine percent of the people
of the United States approve of what I do.

21
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,622
Twenty-nine percent.

22
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,895
When that thing reaches
stroke proportions, put it out as a bulletin.

23
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,906
It's probably the one thing
that'll make Labor Management...

24
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:37,137
...and the Pentagon join hands
and declare a national holiday.

25
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,508
When did you have your last vacation?

26
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,446
When I was six months old,
back in Cleveland, Ohio.

27
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,110
I believe it. Don't forget
the CIA appointment at 2:00.

28
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,653
Phone Liberman.
Tell him to meet me here.

29
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,022
Assuming I'll be alive after lunch.

30
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,718
The White House physician makes
no such assumption.

31
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,455
Your blood pressure's up again,
and I don't like it one little bit.

32
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,897
Now this is an order.
Not just medical advice.

33
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,230
You're to go away for at least two weeks.

34
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,166
Two weeks?

35
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,363
And you can have damn few phone calls.

36
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:09,704
How about a compromise, Horace?
I'll take a quick swim in my pool.

37
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,566
Can I squeeze that in, Paul?

38
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:15,479
People from West Virginia are waiting for
the crowning of the Rhododendron Queen.

39
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,813
Have the Secretary of the Interior handle it.

40
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:20,648
How are you, Horace?
What's new in fee splitting?

41
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,682
That's quite a mob scene you got outside.

42
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,987
Why in God's name do
we elect a man president...

43
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,458
...and then try to see how fast
we can kill him?

44
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:31,691
The Vice-President showed a vast amount
of discretion over valor...

45
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,494
...to go goodwilling when he did.

46
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,125
Pity you didn't join him, Jordie.

47
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,728
I envy Mr. Gianelli his Chianti
and Italian sunshine.

48
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:43,069
My own diet for the next several days
will be crow and bitters.

49
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:45,135
- Goodbye, Horace.
- Doctor.

50
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:48,044
Come on, Ray. You can watch me
do the Lyman crawl.

51
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,822
Thank you.

52
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:09,362
In a half hour I'm due at a meeting
with the illustrious Senator Prentice.

53
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,963
To hear him tell it,
you're a third-grade idiot with clay arches.

54
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,902
But the Chair of the Joint Chiefs...

55
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:19,241
...one General James Mattoon Scott,
who'll be in front of the committees...

56
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:23,305
...he is the reincarnation of Washington
who could walk on that water.

57
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,416
That Gallup Poll shake you up?

58
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,488
Well, let's say I've felt more popular
in my time.

59
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:35,083
Don't get your nanny up.
You knew there'd be some dislocations.

60
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,619
You can't gear a country's economy
for war for 20 years...

61
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,428
...then slam on the brakes
and expect the transition...

62
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,492
...to go like grease through a goose.

63
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,801
Doesn't work out like that.

64
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:49,603
Think of how the psychology of the thing
has been screwed up from the outset.

65
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:52,509
We've been hating the Russians
for a quarter of a century.

66
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,047
Suddenly we sign a treaty saying
in two months...

67
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:58,243
...they're to dismantle their bombs,
we're to dismantle ours...

68
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:00,717
...and we all ride to a peaceful glory.

69
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,350
The country will probably live as if peace
were just as big a threat as war.

70
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:08,360
Damn it, Ray.
We could have had our paradise.

71
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:11,096
Yes, by God, we could have had
full employment...

72
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:13,325
...whopping gross national product...

73
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,958
...nice, cushy feeling that we got a bomb
for every one of theirs.

74
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:21,435
But as sure as God made the State
of Georgia, there'd have come one day...

75
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:25,137
...when they'd have blown us up,
or we'd have blown them up.

76
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:31,140
And the good doctor worries
about my blood pressure.

77
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:34,382
You know who that gentleman is
with the black box?

78
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:35,011
There are five.

79
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:37,955
You know that one of them sits
outside my bedroom at night?

80
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,993
You know what he carries in that box?
The codes.

81
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,322
The codes by which I, Jordan Lyman...

82
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,899
...can give the order sending us
into a nuclear war.

83
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,399
Instead of my blood pressure...

84
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,996
...I think Horace should worry
about my sanity.

85
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,506
You want to know something, Jordie?

86
00:08:56,576 --> 00:09:00,478
Riots and unemployment notwithstanding,
you're an exceptionally fine president.

87
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:04,512
But 25-year friendship aside,
the day may yet come...

88
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:09,112
...when the name Jordan Lyman
and "sanity" will come out as one word.

89
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:13,687
Mention that to General James Scott
when he's up in front of you this morning.

90
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,057
I hear you.

91
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:20,231
And try tea sometime, too, huh?

92
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,692
I'll give it a taste now and then.

93
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,810
I personally visited the President.

94
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,787
I presented him with a documented case
listing the reasons for concern.

95
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,017
Three weeks before the treaty
was ratified...

96
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:48,822
...three of us sat in this same committee
and urged its re-evaluation.

97
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,556
<i>Only last week in Pravda...</i>

98
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,030
Excuse me, General. Sorry to interrupt.

99
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,494
As I understand it...

100
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:58,196
...you feel the signing of this pact
has been detrimental to our security.

101
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,232
If my colleague from Georgia
could confine his comments...

102
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,436
...not only to appropriate business
at hand...

103
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:09,312
...but to observe some of the basic rules
of parliamentary procedure.

104
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:13,216
In my boorish way, I'm only suggesting
that if you two gentlemen...

105
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,777
...continue to work from a script
with cues and stage directions...

106
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:20,792
...these proceedings take on all the dignity
of a very bad Gilbert and Sullivan.

107
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,890
Senator, I'd like to hear
what General Scott has to say.

108
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,760
- Thank you.
- So would I.

109
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,664
The audience has spoken, General,
and I beg forgiveness.

110
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,171
I'll make the point again, Senator.

111
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,371
I think signing a nuclear disarmament pact
with the Soviet Union...

112
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,109
...and at worst
an insupportable negligence.

113
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:49,312
We've stayed alive because we built up
an arsenal and we've kept the peace...

114
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,847
...because we've dealt with an enemy
who knew we would use that arsenal.

115
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,394
Now we're asked to believe
that a piece of paper...

116
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:58,897
...will take the place of missile sites
and Polaris submarines...

117
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:03,264
...and that an enemy who hasn't honored
one solemn treaty in its existence...

118
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,635
...will now, for our convenience,
do precisely that.

119
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,398
I have strong doubts.

120
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:09,998
Hear! That's what I say...

121
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,707
Senator Prentice,
if you would indulge me, sir.

122
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,976
If you would indulge me for a moment, sir.

123
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,747
From the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff I would welcome and respect...

124
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,881
...any judgement having to do specifically
with military considerations...

125
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:28,392
...but insofar as his political attitudes
are concerned...

126
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,985
...these, I'm sure we could dispense with.

127
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:34,655
Senator, we're talking about the survival
of the United States.

128
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,895
Is my uniform a disqualification
in that area?

129
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,801
I presume, General,
that an alternative to the treaty...

130
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:45,641
...that would meet with your approval
would be continuing to build bombs.

131
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:49,113
Bigger bombs, better bombs, more bombs.

132
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:53,110
Until at some given instant,
a trigger-happy idiot presses the button...

133
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,086
...and we all go down the drain
waving the American flag.

134
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:59,318
I'd prefer that to a Pearl Harbor,
when we went down the drain...

135
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:02,657
I did not address the Senator.
I was talking to the witness.

136
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:05,789
I'm suggesting there hasn't been
a piece of paper written...

137
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:09,665
...in the history of mankind that could
serve as a deterrent to a Pearl Harbor.

138
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:12,304
I wonder why we haven't learned
that lesson by now.

139
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:15,239
Every 20 years or so we have
to pick ourselves up bleeding...

140
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,037
...and pay for that mistake.

141
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,475
I might add, Senator...

142
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:22,002
...those mistakes are delivered to us COD
by peace-loving men...

143
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:24,743
...and bought and paid for
with the lives of other men.

144
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,079
Men in uniform.

145
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,249
Have we ever forgotten to thank you?

146
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:35,492
I wasn't soliciting your appreciation,
Senator Clark, only your memory.

147
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:39,789
With all due respect, Senator, might I elicit
one small admission on your part?

148
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,700
That the State of the Union is such
that the current administration...

149
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,534
Thank you.

150
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,377
Well, they listened,
but I'm not sure they heard.

151
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:04,048
Your testimony was the most effective
defense of a position I've ever heard.

152
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,717
Coming from you, Jiggs,
that's fulsome praise indeed.

153
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,990
That forces me to invite you for a drink,
in the name of gratitude.

154
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,055
In the name of military protocol,
you force me to accept.

155
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:16,465
- Your first appointment is at 2:00, General.
- Thank you.

156
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,432
Incidentally, Jiggs.

157
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,405
The alert on Sunday, nobody from the Hill.
No congressmen.

158
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:28,141
This one must be deep and dark,
straight down the line.

159
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:31,615
I noticed that nobody from Congress
was on the list.

160
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:58,204
Hello, Colonel. Hot poop
from all around the globe.

161
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,710
All properly decoded in 4.0 fashion,
and respectively submitted...

162
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:05,114
...by yours truly,
Lieutenant Junior Grade Dorsey Grayson.

163
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,252
Give this one a reading.

164
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,688
"Last call annual Preakness pool."

165
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,587
Top secret code, too.

166
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,417
"$10 already deposited with Murdock.

167
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,893
"Give lengths your pick will win.

168
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:23,199
"Deadline: 17:00, Saturday.
Post time: 1:00, Sunday, 18 May."

169
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:25,270
Scott, where'd this come from?

170
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:27,772
General Scott's aid, you know,
Colonel Murdock.

171
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,832
He gave me that message
at 07:25 this morning.

172
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:34,241
Did you get that name, Colonel?
General Scott.

173
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:37,009
Yeah, I'm so disillusioned,
I could sit down and cry.

174
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,449
My hero turns out to be a bookie.

175
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,913
Say, who'd this go to?

176
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,579
Nothing but the cream.

177
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,252
Commander Vandenburg,
Missile Center, California.

178
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:50,124
Commander...
Strategic Air Command, Omaha.

179
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:53,864
Vice-Admiral Farley C. Barnswell,
Commanding Sixth League, Gibraltar.

180
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,423
St. Pat, Pearl Harbor and...

181
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:59,301
...Commander First Airborne Corps Unit,
United States Army, Fort Bragg, sir.

182
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:01,101
They must have a sure thing.

183
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,109
Colonel, look at this.
Barnswell doesn't think so.

184
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:09,940
Just proves that sometimes even
an admiral can't cough up $10 for a bet.

185
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:22,858
Hiya, Jiggs.

186
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,192
How are you, Mutt?

187
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,200
Just fine. Good to see you.

188
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,429
You look great. Where are you stationed?

189
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:35,539
I haven't given a straight answer to that
in four months.

190
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:39,840
But with your clearance, you know already.
Hell, you probably got me my orders.

191
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,436
I'm Exec of ECOMCON, Jiggs.

192
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:44,305
ECOMCON?

193
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,508
Yes. Site Y.

194
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,851
Don't blame me for your orders.
Come on in.

195
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,152
You live at the base at Site Y?

196
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:55,421
Nobody could live at that hellhole.

197
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:59,192
It's bad enough when the old man
keeps me there four or five days at a time.

198
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,699
Mabel and I have a house in El Paso.

199
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:05,635
I'll give you the number. If you ever get
down that way, we can open a bottle.

200
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:09,641
Listen, I have to go to a party tonight.
If you're free it might be fun for you.

201
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,337
Jiggs, I'd love to but I just can't.

202
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:14,071
How long will you stay?

203
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:17,913
Just till the old man briefs Scott.
I think you know him. Colonel Broderick?

204
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:20,543
Broderick.

205
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,019
Good officer, don't you think?

206
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:25,148
For certain armies.
The kind that goose step.

207
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,287
You don't find a happy medium
in this man's army.

208
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,262
That's for sure.

209
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,528
Say, how many men are there
in your outfit now?

210
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,193
Are you up to strength yet?

211
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,965
Sure we are. We got the full t.o.

212
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:42,974
A hundred officers, 3,600 enlisted.
The last of them came in six weeks ago.

213
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,737
You know, it's funny.

214
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:46,445
What?

215
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:51,715
We seem to spend more time training
for seizure than for prevention.

216
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:55,817
Like the Commies already had the stuff
and we had to get it back.

217
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,287
- Colonel Henderson?
- Yes.

218
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,017
Colonel Broderick's waiting for you.

219
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,889
The sergeant at the desk will show you
where to go.

220
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,259
Jiggs, it's wonderful seeing you.

221
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,094
When you get to El Paso,
that's the number. You call.

222
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,497
You bet I will.

223
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,766
And, Mutt, stop growing, will you?

224
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:20,239
Casey, I hope you didn't discuss
Sunday's alert with Colonel Henderson.

225
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,146
I needn't remind you that it's top secret.

226
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,750
If you needn't remind me,
why do you bring it up?

227
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:27,585
I see no reason for humor.

228
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:31,919
I made a note of it, or was it to place a bet
on the Preakness pool with General Scott?

229
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,016
How did you find out about that?

230
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:37,755
Well, you got Grayson all lathered up
about racehorses.

231
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,262
That kid better learn to keep
his mouth shut.

232
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,528
Don't jump the kid.

233
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,631
How was he to know
the nation's security...

234
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:48,503
...rests on Admiral Barnswell's
parting with $10?

235
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,477
That was the General's personal business.

236
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,979
What are you getting so hot about?

237
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,247
You're right. It's not important.

238
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,259
Operator, have you got a listing
for ECOMCON?

239
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:20,071
E-C-O-M-C-O-N.

240
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,999
You don't? Thank you very much.

241
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:32,943
ECOMCON and horse racing.
What the hell's going on here?

242
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:39,618
Can you explain why the good General
walks into a Senate hearing...

243
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:43,222
...like he's St. George
and the administration's a dragon?

244
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,524
Simmer down, Paul.

245
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:47,931
I mean it. Your boss did everything
but draw a sword.

246
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,833
They asked, he answered.
You guys are getting sensitive.

247
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,666
Little too sensitive if you ask me.

248
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,298
- Good evening, Senator.
- Good evening, Colonel.

249
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:57,171
It's as simple as this.

250
00:18:57,243 --> 00:19:00,007
The President trusts Russia.
The American people don't.

251
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:03,343
They don't believe the Russians
will take the bombs apart on July 1...

252
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,405
...and neither do I.

253
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:08,419
Senator, do you think that the President's
position is so unreasonable?

254
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:12,114
If Russia reneges or cheats,
we'd find out immediately.

255
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:16,355
The deal is off. There'd be no danger.
Now, doesn't that make sense?

256
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,863
Let's hear the view of someone
more knowledgeable...

257
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,594
...as to the Soviet Union's capacity
to destroy us. Colonel Casey?

258
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,668
As a military officer,
I steer clear of politics.

259
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's forget that you're a military officer.
You also happen to be a citizen.

260
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,075
Well, then I'll have to take the Fifth.

261
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:35,639
Colonel, do you like the treaty
or don't you?

262
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,048
Oh, Senator. Pardon me.

263
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,344
I want you to meet
the Indian Ambassador's wife.

264
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,580
Just a moment.
We're discussing the treaty.

265
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:45,351
I want you to hear
the Pentagon's viewpoint.

266
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,122
Go ahead, Colonel.

267
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:51,023
The treaty isn't viewed very favorably.

268
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,395
Neither are income taxes,
but we pay them.

269
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:56,958
But you make me think that fruit salad
on your chest is for neutrality...

270
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,027
...evasiveness and fence-straddling.

271
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:01,266
On the contrary, they're standard awards...

272
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,138
...for cocktail courage
and dinner-table heroism.

273
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,969
I thought you'd invented them.

274
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,410
Excuse me, Paul.

275
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:18,088
Ellie. I didn't know you were back in town.

276
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,917
You never looked.

277
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,695
You surprised me tonight, Colonel Casey.

278
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:29,130
The voice of reason coming out
of a military man?

279
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,896
I've got a lot of hidden talents.

280
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,930
Oh, I suspected that right along.
Ever since my ex-lover introduced us.

281
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:40,738
And how is the staunch General Scott?
And his lovely wife?

282
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:42,375
He keeps busy.

283
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:46,111
So I read. There's a sizeable portion
of the citizenry...

284
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:49,382
...who says that he's the savior
of the western world.

285
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,452
He does his job, Ellie.

286
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,717
Well, take care of him, Jiggs.
See that he rests on the seventh day.

287
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,121
I'll try.

288
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:04,192
That marvelous military stoicism.
The iron mask.

289
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,369
Is that for quenching a torch
or washing a wound?

290
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:12,910
Well, let me put it to you this way,
Jiggs, darling.

291
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:15,410
What the hell business is it of yours?

292
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,247
- I want that.
- No, you don't.

293
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:27,658
Now, you listen to me.
Now, what is it? Is it just Scott?

294
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,152
It's Scott. It's that and everything.

295
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,699
It's my whole damned life.

296
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,598
You're not the first dame to ever wind up
on the bottom of the deck.

297
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:42,004
It happens every day. What matters is
how a person lives with it.

298
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,406
Stop playing the part
of the anguished drunk...

299
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:48,607
...digging olives out of martinis and
boring everybody with tragic stories.

300
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:53,512
You know, sober, Ellie, you're a bright,
beautiful dame.

301
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,286
Good to have around.

302
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:02,053
Will you drive me home, Jiggs?

303
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,560
Whenever you say.

304
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:07,063
I'll get my coat.

305
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:14,295
Good night, Stew.
Thank you for a very nice party.

306
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,898
Thanks for coming, Senator.
Pleasure having you.

307
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:21,145
I hope you forgive
my little outburst tonight.

308
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:25,081
It's a combination of deep concerns
and dry martinis. A dangerous combo.

309
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,311
I've been reamed by experts, Senator.

310
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:28,785
Grey Thunderbird.

311
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:34,785
I was simply trying to get you to say
what I happen to know you believe in.

312
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,192
You work for the one man
who commands confidence...

313
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:39,925
...and could possibly lead us
out of this mess.

314
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,131
You just remember:

315
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,532
There are plenty of us up on the Hill
who stand right alongside of you.

316
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:51,972
We've all got to stay on the alert
these days, Casey.

317
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:53,568
Specially on Sunday, right?

318
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,448
Thank you.

319
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:20,903
There you are.

320
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:24,966
Something's come up. I've got to drive out
to Fort Myer to see the General.

321
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,373
May I call a cab for you?

322
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,338
No, thank you. I'll manage.

323
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:32,043
I'm sorry, Ellie, but this is very important.

324
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,148
All right, Jiggs, but just in case
someone forgets to mention it...

325
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,917
...you're a great crutch.

326
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:43,620
It's too bad you're only available
20 minutes at a time.

327
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:48,365
You can't tell. Sometimes the country
can spare me for a whole evening.

328
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,595
Give me a rain check, I'll prove it.

329
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,706
Tuck it somewhere safe
where you won't forget it.

330
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,541
Good night, Ellie.

331
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:00,943
Good night, Jiggs.

332
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,193
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Jiggs.

333
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,963
Colonel Broderick's with him.

334
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:37,765
Well, well, well.

335
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:43,438
If it isn't my favorite jarhead himself,
Jiggs Casey.

336
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:47,679
Hello, Broderick. I thought you'd be
in Okinawa, or maybe worse.

337
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,416
Not me, Casey boy, not me.
Still protecting the great unwashed?

338
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:55,652
I thought you'd be
a civil liberties lawyer by now.

339
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,821
You might make it yet.

340
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:02,766
By the way, Casey, my boy,
I hear you're doing a fine job...

341
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:05,099
...as Director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

342
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,975
- Hello, Jiggs.
- Good morning, sir.

343
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,502
How was the party last night?

344
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,410
Well, you missed a good one.

345
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,582
Anyone there I know?

346
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:21,742
Paul Girard from the White House and
Senator Prentice were the ranking guests.

347
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,118
There must have been a hassle
over the treaty.

348
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,680
There was, sir.

349
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,492
- Prentice uphold our side all right?
- He was pretty candid.

350
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:32,723
Also quite complimentary about you.

351
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,931
By the way, Ellie Holbrook was there.

352
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,200
Nice seeing her again.

353
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:44,238
- Let's get on with it, Jiggs.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,072
These are from January's All Red Alert, sir.

355
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:52,178
Pearl Harbor, 12 minutes
after the threat warning.

356
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:56,984
Twelve minutes and over 80 percent
of the fleet sitting there like overfed ducks.

357
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,854
Next.

358
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,264
Wright Field, 22 minutes into the alert.

359
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:09,029
This one really gives me an ache in the gut.

360
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:12,832
Half of those aircraft aren't even scrambled
let alone off the ground.

361
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:18,109
Over Mount Thunder.

362
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:22,875
- The President's in the middle helicopter.
- Right out in the open.

363
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:24,779
Thirty-four minutes into the alert.

364
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,980
Canned sound indicates possibility
of hostile action by the Soviet Union.

365
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,388
There are 30 more shots, sir.

366
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,826
Each one of them more fouled up
than the others.

367
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:41,531
Let's hope Sunday's alert
will be different, sir.

368
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:44,034
It damn well better be.

369
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:50,136
Wouldn't it help
if you changed your mind...

370
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:52,570
About what, Jiggs?

371
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:55,573
Inviting the congressional people
to observe the alert.

372
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,441
It wouldn't hurt us if a congressman
or a senator...

373
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,010
...saw how effectively we can work
when we have to.

374
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:05,921
Nobody from the Hill is
to know a thing about this.

375
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:07,818
Yes, sir.

376
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:11,993
Yes?

377
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:15,363
<i>9:20, sir. They're waiting for you
in the conference room.</i>

378
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,396
I've even persuaded the President
to come down without the press.

379
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,534
- No newspapermen?
- None.

380
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:29,309
Get to bed late, sir?

381
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:36,717
Got to bed too early.
Slept from 8:00 to 8:00. Too much sleep.

382
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:40,089
I may never wake up.

383
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,421
Stay close, Jiggs.

384
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,423
I'll want to see you after this meeting.

385
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:19,059
Colonel Murdock said you've heard
about our Preakness pool.

386
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,291
Yes, sir.

387
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,964
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep it to yourself.

388
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:24,935
All I want is the right horse.

389
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:31,706
Admiral Barnswell's reply. I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep that in confidence, too.

390
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:33,039
Of course, sir.

391
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,407
I see the Navy wasn't here today.

392
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:41,415
Admiral Palmer couldn't make it.
We'll brief him later.

393
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:45,684
Speaking of the Navy, that reminds me.
That young J.G. In All Service Radio.

394
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:46,951
Grayson, sir?

395
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,484
He's a bit of a gossip, isn't he?

396
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:50,994
He means well.

397
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:56,124
Well, I'm off to New York
and the AVO Convention.

398
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,364
If you get a chance, listen in.
I'd like to know what you think.

399
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:01,804
- Certainly, sir. Good luck.
- Thank you.

400
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,996
Hey, Colonel, get a load of this.

401
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:35,767
What is it, Grayson?

402
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:38,706
A transfer.

403
00:30:39,544 --> 00:30:40,568
Pearl Harbor?

404
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:43,910
Yes, I think I got some kind
of guardian angel around here.

405
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:47,183
Good old Pearl Harbor.

406
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,716
By the way, Barnswell was the only one
to poop out of the Chairman's racing form.

407
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,384
All the others came through
with their IOUs.

408
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:22,016
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard me
in my nightly newscasts.</i>

409
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:24,014
<i>You know where I stand.</i>

410
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:29,253
<i>I'm not a lover of communists, socialists,
or intellectual bleeding hearts.</i>

411
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:31,855
<i>I happen to have only one interest...</i>

412
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,424
<i>... and that is symbolized by the red,
white and blue of our glorious flag.</i>

413
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,931
<i>Now I'm going to give you the one man...</i>

414
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:47,069
<i>... who not only speaks for that flag,
but has fought for it with distinction...</i>

415
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,272
<i>... and now represents it with honor.</i>

416
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:54,081
<i>Four-star general, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor...</i>

417
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:58,279
<i>... and two Distinguished Service Crosses,
a hero of war...</i>

418
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:01,248
<i>... a stalwart protector of the peace.</i>

419
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,417
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

420
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:09,631
<i>... the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General James Mattoon Scott!</i>

421
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,630
<i>We want Scott! We want Scott!</i>

422
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,893
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the American Veterans Order.</i>

423
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:51,639
<i>I would like to thank Mr. MacPherson
for his most laudatory comments.</i>

424
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,610
<i>You're very generous, Harold.</i>

425
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:55,939
<i>Perhaps patriotism is old-fashioned.</i>

426
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:59,339
<i>Perhaps love of country is outdated.</i>

427
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:05,122
<i>Perhaps even a minute degree of sentiment
to one's motherland is considered passé.</i>

428
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,883
<i>But God help us,
and God help our country...</i>

429
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,459
<i>... if the cynics, the one-worlders,
the intellectual dilettantes...</i>

430
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,432
<i>... ever persuade us that these things
have passed us by...</i>

431
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,400
<i>... because, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

432
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:22,270
<i>... patriotism, loyalty, sentiment,
they are the United States of America!</i>

433
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:38,820
<i>In my lifetime, I have seen 1,000 ways
a man can die.</i>

434
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:43,658
<i>And I know that in this country,
we have a perverse habit of forgetting...</i>

435
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:46,253
Operator, would you connect me
with the White House?

436
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:31,268
The President's expecting you, Colonel.
The study, second door on the right.

437
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:57,964
All I can tell you, pal,
is this better be damned important.

438
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:03,173
- How are you, Colonel Casey?
- Mr. President.

439
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:05,266
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

440
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,804
Ever been up here before, Colonel?

441
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,280
No, sir. It's a big room.

442
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,876
Too big for living and too small
for conventions.

443
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:18,783
- You want a drink, Colonel?
- Yes, sir. Scotch, please.

444
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,984
- Fine. I'll keep you company.
- Thank you.

445
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:23,323
- How about you, Paul?
- No, no, thanks.

446
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:30,429
And now, Colonel,
that matter of national security.

447
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:42,341
Mr. President, have you ever heard
of a military unit known as ECOMCON?

448
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:44,912
What?

449
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:48,282
I'm sorry. E-C-O-M-C-O-N. ECOMCON.

450
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:51,320
No.

451
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,757
What does it mean?

452
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,224
I'm not sure, sir.

453
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:01,195
In formal military abbreviations...

454
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:04,633
...it could stand for Emergency
Communications Control, but...

455
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,107
I've never heard anything like that.

456
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,533
- Have you, Paul?
- No, I haven't.

457
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:18,407
Mr. President, have you ever authorized...

458
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:22,977
...the formation of any type of secret unit,
regardless of it's name...

459
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:27,852
...that has something to do with preserving
the security of things like...

460
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:30,156
...television, telephone or radio?

461
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:31,795
No, I haven't.

462
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,793
Do you know of
any secret Army installation, sir...

463
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:39,530
...that's been set up somewhere
near El Paso recently?

464
00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:41,003
The answer is no again.

465
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,229
Why?

466
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:47,745
Sir, this is something very difficult
for me because...

467
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:50,679
...it concerns a superior officer
whom I admire and respect.

468
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:52,910
Let's get on with it, Colonel, huh?

469
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:54,976
Yes, sir.

470
00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:02,651
Yesterday I learned from a friend of mine,
Colonel Henderson...

471
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:05,161
...that he's the exec officer of ECOMCON.

472
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:10,523
His commanding officer is
an Army colonel named John Broderick.

473
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:14,029
They're both from Signal Corps,
which indicates communications.

474
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:19,439
They've had 100 officers
and 3,600 men training secretly...

475
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,770
...at a desert base near El Paso
for six weeks or so.

476
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:26,845
Well, then Henderson said
an odd thing to me, sir.

477
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:30,945
Something that, well,
I can't shake quite loose of.

478
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:36,961
He said they were spending more time
training for seizing than for preventing.

479
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:39,721
Who set up this outfit?

480
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,564
Henderson and Broderick
reported directly to General Scott...

481
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,899
...so, I assume General Scott did, sir.

482
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,531
You assume? You work directly
under General Scott, don't you?

483
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:54,802
Yes, sir, but, well, I guess I'd been
cut out for some security reason.

484
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:58,413
Go ahead, Colonel.

485
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:06,654
Mr. President, this is
General Hardesty's writing.

486
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,555
I know it pretty well.

487
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,653
That paper came from
the Joint Chiefs' meeting room.

488
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:15,997
I can't make much out of this scrawl.

489
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:21,738
"Airlift ECOMCON 40 K 212s
at Site Y by 07:00 Sunday.

490
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:24,332
"Chi, New York, LA, Utah."

491
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:25,832
K 212s?

492
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,878
Air Force jet transports, sir.

493
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:30,371
What do you make of it?

494
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:33,611
They're obviously scheduled to lift
this command out of Site Y...

495
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:36,882
...that's the base near El Paso,
before the alert, Sunday...

496
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:40,482
...and take those troops to Chicago, LA,
New York and Utah.

497
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:41,850
Why Utah?

498
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,191
The phone company has big relay facilities
for its long lines there.

499
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:47,424
Precisely what are you leading up to?

500
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,694
I'm not certain, Mr. President, but...

501
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,034
Well, let me tell you the other things
that have happened the past two days.

502
00:38:56,941 --> 00:38:59,876
General Scott has a kind of pool
going on the Preakness race...

503
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,468
...which runs on Sunday.

504
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:04,310
He sent messages to every important
field commander...

505
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:06,873
...talking about getting their bets
in on time.

506
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:10,913
Admiral Barnswell was the only one
who sent in a "no bet" message.

507
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:17,326
Your General Scott's interest in horses
isn't classified, Colonel.

508
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:23,734
I don't think those messages had anything
to do with horses, sir.

509
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,564
I think it was some kind of code.

510
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:28,136
That's a fair-sized assumption.

511
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:31,175
General Scott wanted those messages
kept under wraps.

512
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,832
- Under wraps?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:36,574
A J.G. Who decoded those messages
is being shipped out to Hawaii.

514
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:40,943
There are other things, Mr. President.

515
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,579
Last night at a party
at Stewart Dillard's house...

516
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:45,589
- You were there, Paul.
- Yes.

517
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:49,022
Senator Prentice indicated to me
a knowledge of the alert.

518
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:52,494
No one on the Hill is supposed
to know about it.

519
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:55,761
Senator Prentice knows.
And General Scott knows that he knows.

520
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,858
- That's quite an assumption.
- How do you know?

521
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:01,030
The General lied.
He said he was in bed last night at 8:00.

522
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:03,539
I went to his quarters
after the party because...

523
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:07,009
...I was concerned that Senator Prentice
had found out about the alert.

524
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:11,572
He wasn't in bed. He was with Prentice
who arrived at his house at 11:45.

525
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,074
And that's all?

526
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:17,084
Well, Congress recessed yesterday.

527
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:19,985
Vice-President Gianelli is in Italy
on a goodwill tour.

528
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:22,720
This Sunday, you'll be
at an underground command post...

529
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:24,694
...on Mount Thunder, completely alone.

530
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:27,128
You won't even have press people
in attendance.

531
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,324
That's true.

532
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:31,431
General Scott asked that I come alone.

533
00:40:32,337 --> 00:40:34,066
All right, Colonel.

534
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:36,635
Let's sum it up, shall we?

535
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:40,101
You're suggesting what?

536
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:44,645
I'm not sure, Mr. President,
just some possibilities...

537
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:48,447
...what we call "capabilities"
in military intelligence.

538
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,152
You got something against
the English language?

539
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:52,623
No, sir.

540
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,715
Then speak it plainly if you will.

541
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:02,963
I'm suggesting there's a military plot
to take over the government.

542
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:05,859
This may occur sometime
this coming Sunday.

543
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,503
You realize you could be broken out
of the Service for what you've said?

544
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,912
I've thought about the consequences.
I've been a Marine for 18 years.

545
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,415
Comment, Paul?

546
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:24,013
With all due respect to Jiggs,
it's just incredible...

547
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:28,891
...that a secret base could've been
constructed without our hearing about it.

548
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,828
Sir, when you think of the people
and the supplies involved...

549
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,362
Frankly, sir, it doesn't seem logical.

550
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,301
It can be checked out, though.

551
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,966
Yes, I'll call Bill Condon
at the Bureau of Budget. Right now.

552
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:55,544
I know what Scott's attitude is
on the treaty. What's yours?

553
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:02,391
I agree with General Scott, sir.
I think we're being played for suckers.

554
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:07,559
I think it's your business. Yours and
the Senate. You did it and they agreed.

555
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,567
I don't see how we in the military
can question it.

556
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:14,298
I mean, we can question it
but we can't fight it.

557
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,040
We shouldn't, anyway.

558
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:24,345
- Jiggs? Isn't that what they call you?
- Yes, sir.

559
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:29,785
So you stand by the Constitution, Jiggs?

560
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:35,583
I never thought of it just like that,
Mr. President.

561
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:40,421
But that's what we've got,
and I guess it's worked pretty well so far.

562
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:43,557
I sure don't want to be the one to say
we ought to change it.

563
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:44,995
Neither do I.

564
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,242
Do you have any bright ideas
on what else I can do?

565
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:56,037
No, sir, not a one. I'm just a buck passer.

566
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:03,545
I remember what Harry Truman said:
"Inside this room, the buck stops."

567
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:07,288
Thanks for coming to see me, Colonel.

568
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:08,450
Yes, sir.

569
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:12,962
I'd appreciate it if you'd call my secretary
in the morning.

570
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,361
Tell her where you'll be.

571
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:17,299
- Thanks for coming.
- That's all right, sir. It was...

572
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:19,434
A pleasure, Colonel?

573
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,068
To get it out of my gut, yes, sir.

574
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,908
I don't know whether you believe this,
but I hope I'm wrong.

575
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:30,637
Colonel, I hope you're wrong, too.

576
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:33,807
Good night, sir.

577
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:44,620
- Good night, Jiggs.
- Good night, Paul.

578
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:51,593
It is, huh?

579
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,294
Okay, Bill. Thank you.

580
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:03,269
Condon says there's never been
any money cleared for anything called...

581
00:44:03,347 --> 00:44:05,212
...ECOMCON or whatever it is.

582
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:08,943
So your conclusion is negative?

583
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:13,689
My conclusion is that my friend,
Colonel Casey...

584
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:16,817
...is one Marine with a hell
of an imagination.

585
00:44:20,398 --> 00:44:23,629
You know something, Paul?

586
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,931
I'm not about to disregard his story.

587
00:44:26,003 --> 00:44:27,197
But, Mr. President...

588
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:32,402
Of course, if it's true, we've only got
four full days left before Sunday.

589
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:37,475
We'll have to come up
with a list of men I can trust.

590
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:41,951
<i>I can't move very far without the head
of the White House Secret Service.</i>

591
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,182
<i>And Chris Todd. He has the best mind
in the government.</i>

592
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:48,651
<i>And can keep his mouth shut.
And get Ray Clark.</i>

593
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:53,793
With all due respect to Colonel Casey,
let me give you my unequivocal reaction.

594
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:58,999
To believe any fraction of it, you have
to believe in this ECOMCON business.

595
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,528
Nobody's heard of it before.
Not you, Mr. President. Not Girard.

596
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:04,973
Not even Bill Condon
who should've heard of it.

597
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,203
What makes you think it does exist?

598
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:10,074
We have only, and again,
my apologies, Colonel Casey...

599
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:12,377
...your conjecture. No supportable facts.

600
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,045
What about the Hardesty note?
That refers to it and to a Site Y.

601
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,521
That could easily mean another place.
These military games.

602
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:24,657
The multiplicity of our secret bases
confuses ourselves more than the Soviets.

603
00:45:27,198 --> 00:45:29,996
Army Intelligence was asked
to run a security check on...

604
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:32,433
...Colonel Broderick almost two years ago.

605
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:35,995
There's no question that the man's views
are more than just extreme.

606
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:37,802
They border on out-and-out fascism!

607
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,742
- Again, that's suspect, but not evidence.
- Exactly.

608
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:43,541
- Colonel Casey.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:47,910
What about this communications setup
at Mount Thunder?

610
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,120
Whoever controls it, controls
the communications across the country.

611
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:54,851
Rubbish. If I went into court
as Scott's counsel...

612
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:56,894
...l'd move to quash the indictment...

613
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:59,452
...and we'd be out of the courtroom
in 10 minutes.

614
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,363
I'm only offering presumption of evidence.

615
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:06,000
The Navy being left out
of the JCS meetings...

616
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,528
...the Hardesty note,
this business of the jet transports...

617
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,336
Forgive me, Mr. President...

618
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:14,609
...but as for flying troops
to the big cities in an alert...

619
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,113
...that seems to me not only logical
but prudent.

620
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:21,007
Obviously, if the Russians struck,
we'd need disciplined troops...

621
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:25,385
...in the metropolitan areas to keep order
and prevent complete breakdown.

622
00:46:25,656 --> 00:46:29,558
And if I may say so, the conversion
of a wagering pool on the Preakness...

623
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:32,926
...into a code for some sinister plot
to seize the government...

624
00:46:32,997 --> 00:46:38,128
...seems to me suggestive of rather lurid
deductive powers to say the very least.

625
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:45,372
Mr. Secretary, you saw Scott's
performance on television last night.

626
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,304
That was no apolitical military officer.
That was a dedicated politician.

627
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:52,440
We've always known that, Senator...

628
00:46:52,516 --> 00:46:55,508
...but that's no proof of this military junta
you're suggesting.

629
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,110
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

630
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:03,719
We've pretty much exhausted
the information as well as ourselves.

631
00:47:05,396 --> 00:47:08,490
I don't know if the evidence is
as damning as it seems.

632
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:10,833
I do know it's sufficiently damning...

633
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:14,393
...to proceed as if there were more
than a few grains of truth in it.

634
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:17,737
So the following is the plan of procedure:

635
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,438
Chris will stay here to coordinate things.

636
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:27,150
Art's job is to keep tabs on
the Joint Chiefs that were mentioned.

637
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:29,743
You'll have to have men available,
men you trust...

638
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,311
...to handle any situation that comes up.

639
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,858
I want you to go to El Paso.

640
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:43,424
Take the phone number from Colonel Casey
of his friend there.

641
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:45,230
You're to find that base...

642
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:49,033
...if it means crawling underground
until you hit a tunnel.

643
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,038
But you're to find that base if it exists.

644
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:56,913
I don't like sending you down there, Ray.

645
00:47:57,181 --> 00:48:00,241
- Lf there were anyone else I could trust...
- Forget it, Jordie.

646
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:02,842
Outside of getting parity
for Georgia cotton...

647
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,254
...I haven't accomplished a lot
for this country. Maybe this is my chance.

648
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:10,890
- Paul?
- Yes, sir.

649
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:14,522
This is a note you're to take
to Admiral Barnswell in Gibraltar.

650
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:17,192
I want you to get his reply in writing.
Understand?

651
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:19,930
In a court of law,
your word wouldn't count for much...

652
00:48:20,004 --> 00:48:22,165
...against that of Barnswell's or Scott's.

653
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,799
Mr. President, it's Wednesday evening.

654
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:28,705
My feeling is that next week at this time
we'll all be laughing about this.

655
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:30,269
I hope you're right.

656
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:33,978
- Colonel Casey?
- Yes, sir.

657
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:38,246
You'll have the thankless job of informer.

658
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,549
Keep your eye on General Scott.

659
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,761
Keep us informed as to whom he talks to,
whom he hears from, where he goes.

660
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,128
Find out everything you can about him.

661
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:49,822
Yes, sir.

662
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:56,201
I think that does it, gentlemen.

663
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,874
It strikes me you're taking
all the necessary steps save one.

664
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:03,004
Chris, I hope you're quite correct
in your assumption...

665
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,914
...that we're all panicky idiots.
But if you are incorrect in that judgement...

666
00:49:06,984 --> 00:49:10,181
...we're in for a week
of unadulterated nightmare.

667
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:35,770
Good evening, sir.

668
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:38,004
Working late, Jiggs?

669
00:49:38,716 --> 00:49:42,743
Just checking out some final touches
so there won't be any foul-ups on the alert.

670
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,747
Some problems in Texas?

671
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:49,316
No, sir. No problems.

672
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:52,228
I'm glad everything goes well.

673
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,755
I called you after I got back
from New York.

674
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:58,931
About 4:00. They said you'd already gone.

675
00:49:59,003 --> 00:50:00,868
Well, as you can see, not so.

676
00:50:02,072 --> 00:50:03,664
How was the big city, General?

677
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:05,737
You know these conventions.

678
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:08,568
A rat race, luncheons, dinners...

679
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,642
If I ate one more piece of chicken,
I'm afraid...

680
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,443
Did you hear the speech?

681
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:16,851
Yes, sir.

682
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:18,447
And?

683
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,350
Lmpressive.

684
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,428
Now, there's a carefully chosen word.

685
00:50:26,163 --> 00:50:28,893
You wouldn't be holding something back,
would you?

686
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:35,228
That commentator who introduced you,
he struck me as being a little overripe.

687
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:39,066
He is. But he provides a platform
for stating my position.

688
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,643
I merely use him. I don't have to like him
or trust him.

689
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:43,745
I see.

690
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:45,907
Do you see?

691
00:50:49,987 --> 00:50:52,751
This country's in trouble, Jiggs,
deep trouble.

692
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:57,360
Now, there are two ways
we can handle this.

693
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:59,453
We can sit here on our duffs and...

694
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,727
...ask for divine guidance and hope for it.
Or we can...

695
00:51:07,571 --> 00:51:09,129
Or we can what, Jiggs?

696
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:11,673
What would your advice be?

697
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:18,976
We're a nation of laws, of rules.

698
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:23,683
We're military men so we've taken an oath
to uphold the Constitution.

699
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:25,187
The democratic way.

700
00:51:26,423 --> 00:51:27,788
Yes, sir. The democratic way.

701
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:30,793
Do your duty and, as you put it,
ask for divine guidance.

702
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,691
You're right, Jiggs.

703
00:51:33,764 --> 00:51:35,493
You're absolutely right.

704
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:40,597
You know, Jiggs, you've been working
too hard on this damned alert.

705
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:42,201
You look tired.

706
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:48,075
Why don't you take the rest
of the week off?

707
00:51:48,145 --> 00:51:51,410
Duck down to White Sulphur Springs
and blow yourself to a good time.

708
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:54,110
I couldn't. There are too many details
on the alert.

709
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:55,811
Murdock will handle it.

710
00:51:55,953 --> 00:51:58,319
I should be with you at Mount Thunder
on Sunday.

711
00:51:58,389 --> 00:51:59,981
And you will be.

712
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:03,493
Check back on the job Sunday morning
and we'll pick it up together.

713
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,120
In the meantime,
you've got a three-day pass. Enjoy it.

714
00:52:06,196 --> 00:52:09,165
- When do you think I ought to leave, sir?
- Right now.

715
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:10,355
Yes, sir.

716
00:52:16,073 --> 00:52:17,734
Have a good time, Jiggs.

717
00:52:18,976 --> 00:52:20,307
Thank you, sir.

718
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:37,086
Paul Girard get off all right?

719
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:40,062
Still skeptical, but he's on his way
to Gibraltar.

720
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:43,064
Some fellows have all the luck.
Me, I get to go to Texas.

721
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,034
It's enough to make a man
want to quit politics.

722
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:48,033
It's Mutt Henderson's home phone.

723
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:50,596
<i>... Flight 543 for Dallas and El Paso...</i>

724
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:53,700
- Well, that's me.
- Good luck, Senator.

725
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:57,511
Oh, incidentally, Jiggs.

726
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:00,950
I'm told that a Miss Eleanor Holbrook,
you know her...

727
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:02,449
Yes.

728
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:05,217
I'm told she knows more
about General Scott...

729
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:08,122
...than his wife knows about him
or the Air Force.

730
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:09,216
Could be.

731
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:12,854
In fact, she may know enough about him
to put some ammo in our guns.

732
00:53:15,566 --> 00:53:17,056
You catch my meaning?

733
00:53:17,868 --> 00:53:20,234
I'm not sure I want to catch your meaning.

734
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:22,363
Just because General Scott
booted you out...

735
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:26,068
...and told you to take a vacation,
that don't mean you'll take a vacation.

736
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,634
I think you should see this Miss Holbrook.

737
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:31,379
If she's got something on Scott,
we want it.

738
00:53:32,316 --> 00:53:36,548
There are all sorts of ways of protecting
the President of the United States.

739
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:41,588
Take care of yourself, Senator.

740
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:44,558
You, too, Colonel.
741
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,100
Isn't that MacPherson, the commentator?

741
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:05,698
Yes.

742
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:09,132
That's General Scott's car.

743
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,971
Buddy, you've just been impressed
into the Secret Service.

744
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,548
Harold MacPherson
and General James Scott.

745
00:56:39,616 --> 00:56:41,174
There's a pair to draw to.

746
00:56:51,861 --> 00:56:54,022
Good morning, General.
This is Jordan Lyman.

747
00:56:54,097 --> 00:56:56,429
<i>Good morning.
We're both early birds today.</i>

748
00:56:56,499 --> 00:57:00,765
General, to come right to the point.
I'm not going to participate in the alert.

749
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:02,561
<i>Frankly, I'm tired out.</i>

750
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:06,768
<i>I've decided to go to my place at Blue Lake
and fish for a few days.</i>

751
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:09,710
You'll forgive me, sir,
but I must say I don't like it.

752
00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:12,577
As Commander in Chief,
orders can only be given by you.

753
00:57:12,649 --> 00:57:16,210
Mr. President, I don't think
the Russians will be very impressed...

754
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:19,153
...by an alert that takes place
while you go fishing.

755
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:22,089
<i>Suppose you let me be
thejudge of that, General.</i>

756
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:24,555
<i>I'm afraid my decision is final.</i>

757
00:57:24,627 --> 00:57:26,788
Of course. It's up to you, sir.

758
00:57:28,264 --> 00:57:30,562
<i>When do you expect to go to Blue Lake?</i>

759
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,292
Late Friday, probably.

760
00:57:32,802 --> 00:57:35,066
<i>I envy you. Good luck with the fish.</i>

761
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:38,069
<i>- Goodbye, General.
- Goodbye, Mr. President.</i>

762
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:48,511
Hold my calls.

763
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,555
Colonel Broderick, please.

764
00:57:57,861 --> 00:57:59,795
What's that, Mrs. Henderson?

765
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:03,526
I'm an old friend of his.
I'm real anxious to see him.

766
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:06,363
Clark, ma'am. Ray Clark.

767
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:12,337
I know it's restricted,
but I thought perhaps if I could talk to him.

768
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:14,905
What's that?

769
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:17,811
I didn't quite hear you.
Would you say that again?

770
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:24,219
Well, is there any way I could get
a message to him?

771
00:58:30,693 --> 00:58:34,220
Would you be good enough
to just tell him that Ray Clark called?

772
00:58:35,398 --> 00:58:37,525
Thank you very much, Mrs. Henderson.

773
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:49,904
Fill her up?

774
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,612
No thanks, honey. Just check my oil.

775
00:58:56,352 --> 00:58:58,013
Hey, you mind?

776
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:01,551
Not at all. Tell me,
could you turn that down some?

777
00:59:01,624 --> 00:59:02,955
Oh, sure, honey.

778
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,024
Hey, Charlie, turn it down.

779
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:08,828
- Do you rent space in that thing?
- Oh, you.

780
00:59:14,103 --> 00:59:15,468
You want to dance?

781
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:19,074
No, thank you, honey.
I just had a hernia operation.

782
00:59:21,911 --> 00:59:23,173
You are funny.

783
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:28,281
I was sort of hoping you were in the Army.

784
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:31,385
Why?

785
00:59:32,188 --> 00:59:35,021
Charlie heard there was a new base
being put up here.

786
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:36,956
That's why he bought the place.

787
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:41,153
You see any soldiers?

788
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:43,656
How long has the base been here?

789
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:45,191
Who knows?

790
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:50,201
You know Charlie, he's always decorating
this place. He has a talent for that.

791
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,834
And on Saturday night,
he puts out a huge sign.

792
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:57,402
It says, "Big Party."
And he doubles his drinks, too.

793
00:59:58,047 --> 01:00:00,208
And I don't water them none, either.

794
01:00:00,483 --> 01:00:02,917
You wonder what the country's coming to.

795
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,956
All those boys sitting up in the desert,
never seeing no girls.

796
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:11,954
Well, they might as well be in stir.

797
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:14,463
How far is the base from here?

798
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:17,361
About 50 miles or so.

799
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:22,532
You hear the planes coming in and out
all the time, but don't see any pilots.

800
01:00:22,939 --> 01:00:25,772
Not so much as one single pilot.

801
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:30,177
What's the matter?
Don't they drink in the Air Force?

802
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:33,710
How would I get in there?

803
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,777
Oh, lots of luck.
You can't even see the place.

804
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:41,323
There's just a road over leading to the left
and then nothing.

805
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:45,091
I was telling Charlie.

806
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:50,064
We ought to drive up there sometime
with a couple of kegs of beer for the boys...

807
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:53,899
...and tell them where it's from.
You know, leave cards or something.

808
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:54,420
I'm glad we can offer you some real
Mediterranean weather, Mr. Girard.

809
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,718
Thank you, Admiral.

810
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:58,454
Instead of that dirty stuff they have
in the Atlantic.

811
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:00,795
- Care for a cigar?
- No, thanks.

812
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:07,362
Admiral, I understand you're not much
of a betting man.

813
01:03:08,471 --> 01:03:10,166
That depends on the game.

814
01:03:11,774 --> 01:03:15,039
What is your pleasure?
Poker, roulette, what?

815
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:18,410
No, those are house games.
I don't much care for the odds.

816
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:20,882
What about horse racing?

817
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:25,284
On occasion. Depends on the race,
sometimes the weather.

818
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:30,150
- And the horse does make the difference.
- Well, that's true.

819
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,289
What about the Preakness?

820
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,757
Have you got anything good going there?

821
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:43,196
I only bet on sure things.

822
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:50,408
You're a very lucky sailor.
That's exactly what I've got for you.

823
01:03:50,513 --> 01:03:51,639
A sure thing.

824
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:53,879
What is the bet, Mr. Girard?

825
01:03:54,183 --> 01:03:58,347
There are members of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff who are involved in treason.

826
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:00,946
We know who they are,
and the essence of the plan.

827
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,424
And from you,
I want a signed statement indicating...

828
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:09,156
...when you first heard of this operation
and your complicity in this entire matter.

829
01:04:15,738 --> 01:04:17,729
Frankly, I wish I had more time.

830
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:20,305
I wish you did, too, Admiral.

831
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:26,843
Unfortunately, you don't.

832
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:34,603
Jiggs.

833
01:04:34,682 --> 01:04:37,913
I'm looking for a very pretty girl
named Eleanor Holbrook.

834
01:04:38,219 --> 01:04:39,208
Come in.

835
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:40,511
Thank you.

836
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:44,154
You're a long way from the barracks.

837
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:46,022
I was in the neighborhood.

838
01:04:46,327 --> 01:04:47,294
A fact?

839
01:04:47,962 --> 01:04:51,227
A lie. I just thought the country
could spare me for an evening.

840
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:53,789
- I wondered how you were.
- I'm fine, Jiggs.

841
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:57,029
- Would you like a martini?
- That sounds great.

842
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:05,636
Very nice.

843
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:09,042
Yes, that's right.

844
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,619
- You've never been here before.
- No, not even close.

845
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:14,245
Thank you.

846
01:05:15,756 --> 01:05:17,417
What is it, Jiggs?

847
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,284
You have something on your mind.

848
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:23,597
Well, hasn't your mother
ever told you about Marines?

849
01:05:23,797 --> 01:05:25,822
Well, I know all about this Marine.

850
01:05:25,899 --> 01:05:28,390
Never a wasted moment
or a thrown-away day.

851
01:05:29,503 --> 01:05:31,767
What do you want?

852
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,397
Well, you invited me.

853
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:36,442
Remember? A rain check handed out
the night of the party.

854
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:39,109
Oh, yes. Good for one visit, anytime.

855
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:40,875
Here I am.

856
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:44,112
What shall we talk about?

857
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:47,984
Nuclear disarmament, high cost of living,
ladies' fashions?

858
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:54,450
Or should we fall back on the familiar item
of conversation, gentleman Jim Scott?

859
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:01,530
Well, this must come as a shock to you,
but I lock up the office now and then.

860
01:06:02,469 --> 01:06:04,027
You're a beautiful woman.

861
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:07,896
Don't tell me after all this time
you're making a pass, Jiggs.

862
01:06:10,377 --> 01:06:12,538
The window's open.
You could always scream.

863
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:29,890
Is this when I scream?

864
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:32,793
You want to scream?

865
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,766
That's a rather unfair question.

866
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:41,638
I'm a little vulnerable now.

867
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:47,504
Particularly when it concerns an old friend
I happen to like.

868
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:04,661
Do me a favor.

869
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:09,700
Don't complicate my life right now.

870
01:07:11,038 --> 01:07:13,063
I just got over a very bad burn.

871
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:24,817
Would you like another martini?

872
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:26,648
Perhaps we should talk about...

873
01:07:38,899 --> 01:07:42,130
It's funny. It doesn't feel like an iron mask.

874
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:44,895
You're a fraud, Jiggs.

875
01:07:46,273 --> 01:07:48,332
Hey, how about dinner someplace?

876
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:51,940
You might even talk me into wheeling you
around a dance floor.

877
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:57,573
No. I'll fix something for us here.
Did you know that I'm a swinging cook?

878
01:07:58,118 --> 01:08:00,313
Sounds like I've got myself a good deal.

879
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:03,789
You might have, Jiggs. A very good deal.

880
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:07,359
I'll make you two promises:

881
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:11,656
A very good steak, medium rare,
and the truth, which is very rare.

882
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,009
And it's in writing?

883
01:08:58,545 --> 01:09:00,877
Thank God. Now when can you get back?

884
01:09:03,684 --> 01:09:08,451
Trans Ocean, Flight 42 out of Madrid.

885
01:09:09,556 --> 01:09:12,184
Good. I'll see you for breakfast.

886
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:42,846
Someone I knew 1,000 years ago.

887
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,125
It's funny, I can't even remember his name.

888
01:09:46,193 --> 01:09:50,186
Scott, James Mattoon Scott,
General in the United States Air Force.

889
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:52,588
Doesn't ring a bell.

890
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,358
Why does a girl keep a photograph
of a man she doesn't even remember?

891
01:09:58,872 --> 01:10:00,237
I can't imagine.

892
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:11,808
That's an easy way to get rid of a ghost.

893
01:10:12,653 --> 01:10:14,245
It works wonders.

894
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,323
No symptoms remaining?

895
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,257
None that I'm aware of.

896
01:10:21,128 --> 01:10:24,393
If I find that I'm kidding myself,
I know where to go for help.

897
01:10:27,134 --> 01:10:28,567
There's an easy test.

898
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:34,674
Bring it out in the open, look at it,
talk about it, see if it hurts.

899
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:38,067
I don't know what's to be gained
by hurting...

900
01:10:40,747 --> 01:10:42,578
...but if you think it's right...

901
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,378
I think it's right.

902
01:10:46,987 --> 01:10:48,614
I was in love with him.

903
01:10:51,558 --> 01:10:52,616
I found...

904
01:10:54,294 --> 01:10:56,194
...excitement in his strength.

905
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:01,629
I didn't mind about the backstreet angle...

906
01:11:04,137 --> 01:11:07,903
...sneaking time together,
stolen moments from his wife.

907
01:11:10,677 --> 01:11:13,145
Eleanor Holbrook, the emancipated woman.

908
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,612
Go on.

909
01:11:24,191 --> 01:11:26,785
I don't know. I don't know
when it changed.

910
01:11:32,065 --> 01:11:36,525
But I began to realize
that he really never felt anything.

911
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:41,501
Each move was calculated.

912
01:11:44,144 --> 01:11:46,442
He's a very careful man, your general.

913
01:11:48,582 --> 01:11:51,107
I don't believe he ever took a chance
in his life...

914
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:54,676
...or ever really felt anything,
any real emotion.

915
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:04,156
He was so sure of me
that he could even write letters.

916
01:12:06,066 --> 01:12:09,160
A careful man doesn't incriminate himself
in writing.

917
01:12:09,469 --> 01:12:11,164
That's where you're wrong.

918
01:12:13,106 --> 01:12:15,597
If he's sure enough, he can do anything...

919
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:18,742
...anything to amuse himself.

920
01:12:23,617 --> 01:12:24,743
I kept them.

921
01:12:26,086 --> 01:12:29,988
I told myself that I'd use them
against him for revenge.

922
01:12:33,326 --> 01:12:34,691
At least, Jiggs...

923
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:38,156
...he was right about me in that respect.

924
01:12:39,066 --> 01:12:41,227
I was pretty low, but not that low.

925
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:45,732
Is that what you wanted?

926
01:12:47,307 --> 01:12:49,298
Does that prove anything to you?

927
01:12:49,876 --> 01:12:52,140
- I'm sorry, Ellie.
- No.

928
01:12:53,313 --> 01:12:55,747
You said to bring it out in the open.
Now it is.

929
01:12:55,816 --> 01:12:58,148
- We go from here, all right?
- Sure.

930
01:13:01,388 --> 01:13:04,619
I'll go and repair the damages
and get back to that steak.

931
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:06,921
Don't go away.

932
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:38,083
You know, it's a funny thing, Jiggs.

933
01:13:39,226 --> 01:13:40,887
I'm not surprised at Scott.

934
01:13:42,963 --> 01:13:44,931
But do you know what does cut?

935
01:13:45,332 --> 01:13:48,426
The fact that he sent you.
And the fact that you came.

936
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:53,266
I need these, Ellie.
The reason doesn't matter.

937
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,901
And trying to soften me up
with a little preliminary lovemaking...

938
01:13:57,077 --> 01:13:58,544
That was dirty pool, Jiggs.

939
01:13:58,612 --> 01:14:03,106
You didn't come here to salvage me.
You came here to salvage his good name.

940
01:14:03,183 --> 01:14:06,277
If I could tell you why I had to do this,
you'd understand.

941
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:09,588
I was a stupid, impressionable female...

942
01:14:10,223 --> 01:14:13,886
...who let an Air Force general use her
like his personal airplane.

943
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:17,086
I don't rate any applause, God knows.
But you...

944
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:23,260
Scott didn't want to dirty his hands
collecting those letters...

945
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:27,966
...but Colonel Casey is always ready
to clean up the General's privy.

946
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:20,190
The man on the right, that's Murdock,
General Scott's aide.

947
01:15:20,927 --> 01:15:24,795
On the left, that's Colonel Broderick.
He commands the base at Site Y.

948
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:28,225
I don't know who the other man is.

949
01:15:28,702 --> 01:15:30,897
So the rabbit laid bait for the fox.

950
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:35,333
If I'd gone up to Blue Lake,
they'd have tried to kidnap me.

951
01:15:35,408 --> 01:15:36,875
I have no doubt of that at all.

952
01:15:36,943 --> 01:15:39,969
I'll make the following admission,
Colonel Casey.

953
01:15:40,046 --> 01:15:43,573
Any doubts I may have had have been
properly placed in the wastebasket.

954
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:45,015
Good man, Chris.

955
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,950
Your group did a great job
this morning, Art.

956
01:15:49,022 --> 01:15:51,149
- It's appreciated.
- Thank you, sir.

957
01:15:51,224 --> 01:15:54,193
I can bring out another point
that's made in that film.

958
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:57,719
Scott had to dispatch Colonel Broderick
all the way from El Paso...

959
01:15:57,797 --> 01:16:00,322
...on a job that any investigator
could've done.

960
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,166
This must mean, in terms of numbers,
he's no better off than we are.

961
01:16:04,237 --> 01:16:06,034
That's good solid evidence, right there.

962
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:09,405
And gentlemen,
Paul Girard should be here very shortly.

963
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:13,446
This stuff you unearthed, Colonel Casey,
is dynamite.

964
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,345
Very revealing of General Scott's
extracurricular love life.

965
01:16:19,185 --> 01:16:21,779
Any taste of victory we have
in our mouths...

966
01:16:21,855 --> 01:16:24,449
...is due in no small measure
to your efforts.

967
01:16:25,025 --> 01:16:28,392
The taste I've got in my mouth,
Mr. Secretary, is unmentionable.

968
01:16:28,461 --> 01:16:30,622
I can understand that feeling, Colonel.

969
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:33,359
But when you deal with a jackal
like your general...

970
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:35,424
This is a full Air Force general.

971
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:38,096
Six times wounded.
Wearing half the medals he deserves.

972
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:39,638
Whatever he is, he's no jackal.

973
01:16:39,706 --> 01:16:41,970
My God, the sensitivity of our warriors.

974
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:43,509
Did I step on your old school tie?

975
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:45,134
You're just like a lot of civilians.

976
01:16:45,211 --> 01:16:48,112
After every armistice you want
to put us away in mothballs.

977
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:50,775
When it comes to dying,
you want to put us in a uniform!

978
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,112
That's enough!

979
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:53,508
Please.

980
01:16:54,054 --> 01:16:55,749
I'm sorry, sir.

981
01:16:56,423 --> 01:16:59,085
You have every right to resent
what you were forced to do.

982
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,184
It was a dirty, thankless job.

983
01:17:01,494 --> 01:17:04,088
Its necessity doesn't make it
more palatable.

984
01:17:04,164 --> 01:17:07,622
I appreciate how you feel,
and deeply appreciate what you've done.

985
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:11,034
I could never bring myself to use
any of this against Scott.

986
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,129
Suppose it comes down to bare knuckles.

987
01:17:13,206 --> 01:17:15,868
Chris, I'm not prepared
to answer that just now.

988
01:17:15,942 --> 01:17:17,773
Thank God, I don't have to.

989
01:17:18,478 --> 01:17:21,311
For the first time,
I'd say we were on top of it.

990
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:22,643
Mr. President.

991
01:17:27,821 --> 01:17:29,311
Paul Girard is dead.

992
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,922
Oh, my God!

993
01:17:34,094 --> 01:17:37,393
His plane crashed in the mountains
outside of Madrid.

994
01:17:37,897 --> 01:17:39,228
Any effects?

995
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:44,935
The wreckage was strewn out
for a couple of miles.

996
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:46,973
Nothing left of anybody.

997
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,136
You've got to give out
some kind of statement.

998
01:18:24,844 --> 01:18:27,278
- Can I draft one for you?
- What?

999
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:30,516
About his being away.

1000
01:18:34,854 --> 01:18:38,051
Say he was abroad on a vacation.
Don't say any more than that.

1001
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,831
I've had two close friends in my life.
I mean, really close.

1002
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:51,036
One was Paul Girard.

1003
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,667
The other is Ray Clark.

1004
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:59,576
One of them helped me become president.

1005
01:19:01,414 --> 01:19:04,406
This one helped me to remain president.

1006
01:19:06,653 --> 01:19:08,644
I've cost Paul Girard his life.

1007
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:13,953
What about Ray Clark? Where is he?

1008
01:19:16,396 --> 01:19:18,091
Where in God's name is he?

1009
01:19:18,998 --> 01:19:21,694
Now look here, Prentice.
Don't you jolly me, boy.

1010
01:19:21,768 --> 01:19:25,795
I'm 24 hours stuck in this oven.
You heard me right, boy.

1011
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:31,877
When I get out of here, you better be ready
with a long list of answers.

1012
01:19:32,946 --> 01:19:35,972
You heard me right, boy.
You heard me right.

1013
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:41,013
Yes, Senator.

1014
01:19:41,888 --> 01:19:43,185
I agree, sir.

1015
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,550
By all means, Senator.

1016
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,722
Very well, sir.

1017
01:19:52,966 --> 01:19:57,494
Prentice assures me your committee
was notified of the existence of this base.

1018
01:19:57,904 --> 01:20:00,771
You were vacationing someplace
off in Georgia...

1019
01:20:00,874 --> 01:20:03,342
...getting a change of scene or something.

1020
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:07,569
You better get yourself a change of story
because that don't cut any ice.

1021
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:11,712
I've been doing no vacationing
since Congress has been in session.

1022
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:15,476
There is no record of any ECOMCON base...

1023
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:17,813
...or any designation like it.

1024
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:25,663
Why don't you have yourself a drink
and finish your dinner?

1025
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:29,896
I'll show you around our base
a little later on.

1026
01:20:29,969 --> 01:20:31,561
We're mighty proud of it.

1027
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:33,503
I'd like to take that tour right now.

1028
01:20:33,573 --> 01:20:36,701
That won't be possible, Senator,
that won't be possible.

1029
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,511
But I'll see you later.
We'll look around when it's cooler.

1030
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:31,723
Jordie, boy.

1031
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:36,095
Right now, short of
a Confederate miracle...

1032
01:21:38,404 --> 01:21:42,238
...you're going to be walking in a parade
with both your legs cut off.

1033
01:21:45,712 --> 01:21:49,307
I'm not going to make matters worse
by getting drunk on the job.

1034
01:22:05,832 --> 01:22:08,767
<i>Keep on working.
I will talk with the Consul.</i>

1035
01:22:11,738 --> 01:22:14,366
- Are you the American Consul?
- Yes, I'm from the embassy.

1036
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,601
- I'm Captain Ortega.
- Henry Whitney.

1037
01:22:17,243 --> 01:22:20,770
We are collecting the effects,
but there really isn't very much.

1038
01:22:22,215 --> 01:22:26,879
As I told them over the phone, there were
only two American nationals on board.

1039
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:30,183
Mrs. Agnes Buchanan
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1040
01:22:30,757 --> 01:22:34,591
And a Mr. Paul Girard.
His destination was Washington.

1041
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:38,057
There was no address
on the passenger manifest.

1042
01:22:59,786 --> 01:23:02,516
Did you find any effects of the Americans?
Anything at all?

1043
01:23:02,588 --> 01:23:04,283
<i>Nothing yet, señor.</i>

1044
01:23:20,506 --> 01:23:21,871
Senator Clark?

1045
01:23:22,942 --> 01:23:23,806
Yeah.

1046
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,779
I'm Colonel Henderson,
Colonel Broderick's adjutant.

1047
01:23:32,852 --> 01:23:36,515
I didn't think Colonel Broderick
had an adjutant, just a bartender.

1048
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:38,648
I don't understand, sir.

1049
01:23:38,725 --> 01:23:41,751
Well, it's just that you're so hospitable
around here.

1050
01:23:42,729 --> 01:23:45,459
I got a message yesterday
that you'd call my home.

1051
01:23:45,531 --> 01:23:49,365
I didn't connect you with the message
until I found out you were here.

1052
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:52,369
I'm sorry about your having
to stay in your room.

1053
01:23:52,438 --> 01:23:55,737
Frankly, I don't understand it,
but the orders were quite specific.

1054
01:23:55,808 --> 01:23:57,503
I'll just have to live with it.

1055
01:23:57,577 --> 01:24:01,809
As to the call, I was really phoning
for a mutual friend of ours, Jiggs Casey.

1056
01:24:02,715 --> 01:24:03,875
Mutt, isn't it?

1057
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:06,981
That's what they call me.
How do you know Jiggs?

1058
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:09,817
He has been up before our committee
a number of times...

1059
01:24:09,889 --> 01:24:12,619
...and he's done some favors for me
on occasion.

1060
01:24:16,162 --> 01:24:17,754
Could I get you a drink?

1061
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,889
Those part of your orders, Colonel?

1062
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:21,793
I don't understand.

1063
01:24:21,868 --> 01:24:23,597
To get me snoggered?

1064
01:24:24,103 --> 01:24:25,331
No, sir. I just...

1065
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:28,169
These bottles have been coming in
every hour on the hour.

1066
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:30,368
Doesn't that seem a little odd to you?

1067
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:33,677
I mean, keeping me cooped up in here
with a flow of bourbon!

1068
01:24:33,746 --> 01:24:36,112
- I don't know what you're saying.
- What do you know?

1069
01:24:36,182 --> 01:24:37,308
About what?

1070
01:24:37,383 --> 01:24:39,544
Would you sit down and hear me out?

1071
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,844
I guess so.

1072
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:47,490
I want to preface this
with an assurance to you.

1073
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:51,724
My mind is sound, even though I've been
cooped up here for a day and a night.

1074
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:55,696
Do you trust Jiggs Casey?

1075
01:24:55,768 --> 01:24:58,168
You name it, he can have it, sir. Why?

1076
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,769
If he told you something,
would you believe him?

1077
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:03,206
I would, indeed.

1078
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:05,773
All right, then. Check this one out.

1079
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:11,576
When you told Jiggs about ECOMCON
last Monday...

1080
01:25:12,552 --> 01:25:14,486
...he'd never heard of it before.

1081
01:25:15,755 --> 01:25:16,779
That's funny.

1082
01:25:18,224 --> 01:25:20,419
There was a moment, just one moment.

1083
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:24,755
How did you know about
my seeing Jiggs on Monday?

1084
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:27,459
He told me.
He told some other people, too.

1085
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,567
He'd never heard of it before.

1086
01:25:29,936 --> 01:25:34,873
After you left, Jiggs went over
all the JCS orders for the last year.

1087
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:38,575
There was no record of ECOMCON
or anything like it.

1088
01:25:38,644 --> 01:25:42,603
Impossible. Colonel Broderick goes to
Washington all the time to brief the brass.

1089
01:25:42,682 --> 01:25:44,115
Not all of the brass.

1090
01:25:44,817 --> 01:25:47,945
Not President Lyman, not me.
A very selective briefing.

1091
01:25:48,955 --> 01:25:50,684
All you've got to know is this:

1092
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:55,887
The government of the United States is
at the top of the Washington Monument...

1093
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:59,655
...tipping right and left, ready to fall
and break up on the pavement.

1094
01:25:59,732 --> 01:26:01,893
Just a handful of men can prevent that.

1095
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,962
And you're one of them.

1096
01:26:04,704 --> 01:26:06,228
Now you listen to me, Mutt.

1097
01:26:10,743 --> 01:26:13,507
I'll tell you the damnedest story
you ever heard.

1098
01:26:15,414 --> 01:26:19,851
You're relieved. I'm taking the civilian
in my custody. Go back to the barracks.

1099
01:26:19,919 --> 01:26:21,147
Senator Clark.

1100
01:26:32,832 --> 01:26:33,958
Post 10.

1101
01:26:36,168 --> 01:26:37,692
Give me Colonel Broderick's office.

1102
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:41,166
I'm sorry, but I have orders that the civilian
is not to leave the base.

1103
01:27:41,233 --> 01:27:45,067
I'm countermanding those orders,
and escorting the civilian into town.

1104
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:48,434
Sir, I don't know.
Colonel Broderick said that...

1105
01:27:52,144 --> 01:27:53,577
Throw the keys over here.

1106
01:27:53,646 --> 01:27:56,911
Eject that cartridge belt,
and throw it down on the ground.

1107
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:23,500
You stay put right here.
I'll phone the White House.

1108
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:28,077
When this is over, you can take off
your girdle and have yourself a good cry.

1109
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:31,381
Say, have you got a dime
to stop a revolution with?

1110
01:29:22,468 --> 01:29:27,030
Ma'am, did you see a real tall soldier
with a funny hat waiting right here?

1111
01:29:27,707 --> 01:29:28,571
No.

1112
01:29:56,936 --> 01:29:59,131
Could your men have been mistaken, Art?

1113
01:29:59,772 --> 01:30:02,969
<i>Not a chance, sir.
The gate guard was too positive.</i>

1114
01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:04,566
<i>It was Henderson all right.</i>

1115
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:07,441
<i>Brought into the Fort Myer stockade,

1116
01:30:07,513 --> 01:30:11,449
<i>Rode in the back of an Army sedan
under guard. Now held incommunicado.</i>

1117
01:30:13,052 --> 01:30:15,020
Okay, Arthur. Thank you.

1118
01:30:16,789 --> 01:30:18,279
At least he's alive.

1119
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,050
Admiral Barnswell, sir.

1120
01:30:27,867 --> 01:30:30,097
Admiral Barnswell, this is the President.

1121
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:35,706
Well, sir, he came aboard a few days ago...

1122
01:30:37,109 --> 01:30:41,341
...he passed on your personal greetings,
and that's about the size of it, sir.

1123
01:30:45,951 --> 01:30:49,853
Frankly, no, Mr. President.
He gave me nothing to sign.

1124
01:30:53,659 --> 01:30:57,755
I'm sorry, sir. I can only recount to you
the situation as it occurred.

1125
01:30:58,564 --> 01:31:00,122
I signed no paper.

1126
01:31:01,033 --> 01:31:02,762
He took nothing with him.

1127
01:31:07,573 --> 01:31:11,031
Well, if anything happens
to revitalize your memory, Admiral...

1128
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:13,735
...l'd appreciate a phone call.

1129
01:31:24,757 --> 01:31:27,055
It's now 2:20 on a Saturday afternoon.

1130
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:31,322
At 2:20 tomorrow afternoon...

1131
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:35,695
...somebody will have thrown a switch
at Mount Thunder...

1132
01:31:36,635 --> 01:31:40,230
...General James Scott will be
on all three television networks...

1133
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,340
...explaining to the United States people
why this crucifixion is an act of faith.

1134
01:31:47,413 --> 01:31:50,109
What would you call this?
Sponge-throwing time?

1135
01:31:50,182 --> 01:31:52,742
Mr. President, what are you waiting for?

1136
01:31:53,385 --> 01:31:56,912
Fire Scott, Hardesty, Dieffenbach, Riley.

1137
01:31:57,890 --> 01:32:01,519
Sedition, pure and simple.
Close down Mount Thunder.

1138
01:32:01,794 --> 01:32:03,455
Declare a state of martial law.

1139
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:06,225
And then where do I stand?
A lunatic. A paranoiac.

1140
01:32:06,398 --> 01:32:08,798
A screaming wild man
with nothing to back him up...

1141
01:32:08,868 --> 01:32:11,268
...because his proof is scattered
over a mountain...

1142
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:16,240
...disappeared in an airport, or it's all part
of delirium tremens of a dipso senator.

1143
01:32:21,647 --> 01:32:24,548
Would you allow me to strike
that last idiotic remark?

1144
01:32:25,517 --> 01:32:29,009
There's no need, Jordie.
It's just what the Congress would say.

1145
01:32:30,155 --> 01:32:32,453
But you do have one last alternative.

1146
01:32:33,025 --> 01:32:34,117
And that is?

1147
01:32:36,962 --> 01:32:39,954
To use these letters
that Casey got from the girl.

1148
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:48,063
When you get to the bottom of the barrel,
where we are now, you use expedients.

1149
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:51,373
Hit the network cutoff.

1150
01:32:51,443 --> 01:32:52,774
Network cutoff.

1151
01:32:53,579 --> 01:32:54,568
Good.

1152
01:32:55,381 --> 01:32:57,246
Now, one more time. Position A.

1153
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:59,083
Site G. Pope Field.

1154
01:33:04,323 --> 01:33:06,723
- Position B.
- ECOMCON force. Site Y.

1155
01:33:09,728 --> 01:33:12,424
- Position C.
- Site X. Mount Thunder, C.P.

1156
01:33:12,665 --> 01:33:13,962
Good, good.

1157
01:33:29,848 --> 01:33:30,837
Let's hear it.

1158
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:32,850
Barney Rutkowski, Air Defense.

1159
01:33:33,118 --> 01:33:37,350
He's screaming bloody murder about those

1160
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:41,084
Says they're checked for El Paso
and then lost on the radar screen.

1161
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,651
Wants to know where they went and why.

1162
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:47,722
He also wants to know why 30 more
are at Bragg with the same destination.

1163
01:33:47,967 --> 01:33:51,459
- What did you tell him?
- I told him it was classified and to forget it.

1164
01:33:51,537 --> 01:33:53,095
Well, that ought to do it.

1165
01:33:55,107 --> 01:33:58,474
He's a hard-nosed book player
with a radar screen at his bed.

1166
01:33:58,944 --> 01:34:03,313
If I know him, he's not going to stop here.
He'll go right up to the President.

1167
01:34:04,717 --> 01:34:06,048
Go ahead, Barney.

1168
01:34:06,318 --> 01:34:09,845
<i>One of my controllers was watching
a flight of troop carriers Wednesday...</i>

1169
01:34:09,922 --> 01:34:11,253
<i>... heading for El Paso.</i>

1170
01:34:11,323 --> 01:34:14,554
<i>They turned northwest
and dropped off our radar screens.</i>

1171
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:17,321
<i>We tried to find out about it
through channels...</i>

1172
01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:19,421
<i>... and all we get is the big stall.</i>

1173
01:34:19,531 --> 01:34:22,398
<i>There's some kind of a secret base
out there...</i>

1174
01:34:22,468 --> 01:34:25,096
<i>... and I think I should have been
notified of it.</i>

1175
01:34:25,838 --> 01:34:27,066
Keep going, General.

1176
01:34:27,206 --> 01:34:32,166
<i>Thirty more transports were due at this
classified place at 7:00 a.m. Tomorrow.</i>

1177
01:34:32,644 --> 01:34:35,511
<i>Now I learn it's been moved up
to 23:00 tonight.</i>

1178
01:34:43,956 --> 01:34:46,083
I want all those aircraft grounded.

1179
01:34:46,892 --> 01:34:49,656
You're to give the order
that they're to stand down.

1180
01:34:49,728 --> 01:34:53,960
That's been authorized by the President,
can be verified by calling the White House.

1181
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:55,523
Do you understand that?

1182
01:34:55,601 --> 01:34:57,000
<i>I guess I do, sir.</i>

1183
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,867
I want you available.

1184
01:34:58,937 --> 01:35:01,337
Phone in and let this office know
where you are.

1185
01:35:01,407 --> 01:35:02,567
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1186
01:35:05,677 --> 01:35:08,271
The next step should be
to your liking, Chris.

1187
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:10,580
<i>- Esther?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1188
01:35:10,849 --> 01:35:12,316
Call the Pentagon.

1189
01:35:12,885 --> 01:35:15,285
Tell General Scott
I want to see him right away.

1190
01:35:15,354 --> 01:35:18,152
I think it's time we faced the enemy,
Mr. President.

1191
01:35:18,924 --> 01:35:20,357
He's not the enemy.

1192
01:35:20,759 --> 01:35:22,454
Scott, the Joint Chiefs...

1193
01:35:23,195 --> 01:35:27,632
...even the very emotional, very illogical
lunatic fringe, they're not the enemy.

1194
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:29,700
The enemy is an age.

1195
01:35:30,669 --> 01:35:31,897
A nuclear age.

1196
01:35:33,472 --> 01:35:36,600
It happens to have killed man's faith
in his ability...

1197
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,205
...to influence what happens to him.

1198
01:35:40,612 --> 01:35:43,911
And out of this comes a sickness.
A sickness of frustration.

1199
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,378
A feeling of impotence,
helplessness, weakness.

1200
01:35:48,654 --> 01:35:51,589
And from this, this desperation...

1201
01:35:52,858 --> 01:35:55,793
...we look for a champion
in red, white and blue.

1202
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:58,461
Every now and then
a man on a white horse rides by...

1203
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:01,966
...and we appoint him to be
our personal god for the duration.

1204
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:07,500
For some men it was a Senator McCarthy.
For others it was a General Walker.

1205
01:36:09,308 --> 01:36:11,173
Now it's a General Scott.

1206
01:36:37,402 --> 01:36:39,802
<i>- Yes?
- General Scott is here, sir.</i>

1207
01:36:43,108 --> 01:36:44,871
Send him in, please.

1208
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,075
Good evening, Mr. President.

1209
01:36:54,153 --> 01:36:55,586
Sit down, General.

1210
01:37:05,264 --> 01:37:08,165
I'm glad you decided to call off
that fishing trip.

1211
01:37:09,134 --> 01:37:10,567
Don't bother about that.

1212
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:15,334
We don't need it tonight.

1213
01:37:17,342 --> 01:37:19,810
We aren't going to have an alert tomorrow.

1214
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:25,374
I beg your pardon, Mr. President.
You wish the alert cancelled?

1215
01:37:25,517 --> 01:37:27,747
I do. I intend to cancel it.

1216
01:37:29,488 --> 01:37:30,750
May I ask why?

1217
01:37:31,823 --> 01:37:36,419
Certain facts have come to my attention.
I won't waste time detailing them all now.

1218
01:37:36,695 --> 01:37:39,664
I'll simply say that
I want your resignation tonight...

1219
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:43,926
...and those of Generals Hardesty,
Riley and Dieffenbach as well.

1220
01:37:50,275 --> 01:37:53,904
Either you are joking,
or you have taken leave of your senses.

1221
01:37:53,979 --> 01:37:58,075
I know of no reason why I should remove
my name from the active list voluntarily.

1222
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:00,675
Or, for that matter,
any of the other Joint Chiefs.

1223
01:38:00,752 --> 01:38:03,118
You could give me the reasons, General.

1224
01:38:03,722 --> 01:38:06,657
But if you want me to itemize them,
I shall be glad to do so.

1225
01:38:06,725 --> 01:38:07,714
Please do.

1226
01:38:07,893 --> 01:38:10,054
You have used, without my authority...

1227
01:38:10,996 --> 01:38:14,454
...substantial sums from
the Joint Chiefs' Contingency Fund...

1228
01:38:14,967 --> 01:38:18,994
...to establish a base, and train
a special unit of troops whose purpose...

1229
01:38:19,071 --> 01:38:22,336
...and even whose existence,
was kept secret from me...

1230
01:38:22,941 --> 01:38:26,638
...from officials of the Bureau of the Budget
and members of the Congress.

1231
01:38:26,712 --> 01:38:28,145
And the name of the unit?

1232
01:38:28,213 --> 01:38:29,578
You know that unit.

1233
01:38:30,148 --> 01:38:32,275
It's designation is ECOMCON.

1234
01:38:35,153 --> 01:38:37,815
I'm afraid your memory fails you,
Mr. President.

1235
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:41,120
You gave me verbal authorization
for the base and the unit.

1236
01:38:41,526 --> 01:38:43,756
As I recall, we covered many items
that day.

1237
01:38:43,829 --> 01:38:45,854
Perhaps you didn't pay much attention.

1238
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:48,399
I assumed you'd inform
the Director of the Budget.

1239
01:38:48,467 --> 01:38:50,958
What was the date of that meeting,
General?

1240
01:38:51,036 --> 01:38:55,939
I can't recall exactly, but it was right here
in this office. Last November, I believe.

1241
01:38:56,008 --> 01:38:58,476
You have a record of the date and subject?

1242
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:01,878
Certainly, Mr. President, in my office.

1243
01:39:02,914 --> 01:39:05,815
If you want,
I'll get it from the Pentagon now.

1244
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:08,216
That won't be necessary, General.

1245
01:39:08,287 --> 01:39:09,811
No, it won't be necessary.

1246
01:39:10,188 --> 01:39:13,624
Colonel Murdock, my aide, is outside.
He sat in on the meeting.

1247
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:18,125
He will substantiate my memorandum
as to the date and the discussion.

1248
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:21,666
- I'll ask him in.
- That won't be necessary either, General.

1249
01:39:23,201 --> 01:39:26,796
You kept a member of the US Senate
forcibly detained at this base...

1250
01:39:26,872 --> 01:39:28,305
...and he will so testify.

1251
01:39:28,373 --> 01:39:29,362
That would be?

1252
01:39:29,441 --> 01:39:33,207
That would be Senator Raymond Clark,
the senior senator from Georgia.

1253
01:39:33,912 --> 01:39:37,075
I wasn't aware that Senator Clark
had ever visited the base.

1254
01:39:37,149 --> 01:39:39,549
He will also testify as to the collusion...

1255
01:39:40,352 --> 01:39:43,879
...between the commander of the base
and Senator Prentice of California...

1256
01:39:43,955 --> 01:39:48,051
...who with yourself and a handful of others
knew of the existence of the base.

1257
01:39:55,767 --> 01:39:56,995
Any other charges?

1258
01:39:57,235 --> 01:39:59,703
Would you like them
in chronological order?

1259
01:40:00,672 --> 01:40:03,869
The selection of a commanding officer
for a secret base...

1260
01:40:03,942 --> 01:40:07,002
...who is openly contemptuous
of civilian authority...

1261
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:11,113
...and who's made statements that come
close to violation of the sedition laws.

1262
01:40:11,249 --> 01:40:15,686
I never discuss politics with my officers,
but I do demand the highest competence.

1263
01:40:16,288 --> 01:40:19,689
Colonel Broderick is an excellent officer
with a fine combat record.

1264
01:40:19,758 --> 01:40:22,420
And an interesting travel record,
you might add.

1265
01:40:22,494 --> 01:40:26,931
What was he doing on a motor boat
cruising around my island at Blue Lake?

1266
01:40:26,998 --> 01:40:30,695
Don't tell me that's my imagination
because I've got him on film.

1267
01:40:30,769 --> 01:40:35,172
What about the kidnapping and detention
of Colonel Henderson at the airport today?

1268
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,003
I know about that case.

1269
01:40:37,075 --> 01:40:40,169
Colonel Henderson struck an enlisted man
and left his post.

1270
01:40:40,245 --> 01:40:42,509
He's now being held for disciplinary action.

1271
01:40:42,647 --> 01:40:46,549
Incommunicado, you might add.
So that he doesn't tell what he knows.

1272
01:40:47,986 --> 01:40:51,012
And then there are the wagering activities
of yours, General...

1273
01:40:51,089 --> 01:40:53,455
...particularly a betting pool
on the Preakness.

1274
01:40:53,525 --> 01:40:55,356
Come now, Mr. President.

1275
01:40:55,894 --> 01:40:59,455
Or perhaps more aptly classified,
your personal and private code.

1276
01:41:00,298 --> 01:41:02,994
It covers your plan
for the military overthrow...

1277
01:41:03,068 --> 01:41:05,195
...of the United States Government.

1278
01:41:05,604 --> 01:41:08,835
I presume, Mr. President,
you're prepared to back up that charge.

1279
01:41:09,074 --> 01:41:12,168
I am prepared to brand you
for what you are, General.

1280
01:41:13,111 --> 01:41:16,512
A strutting egoist
with a Napoleonic power complex.

1281
01:41:17,382 --> 01:41:19,145
And an out-and-out traitor!

1282
01:41:20,585 --> 01:41:23,076
I know you think
I'm a weak sister, General...

1283
01:41:23,488 --> 01:41:27,219
...but when it comes to my oath of office
and defending the Constitution...

1284
01:41:27,292 --> 01:41:28,486
I know how to salute a flag.

1285
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,427
You don't know the democratic processes
it represents.

1286
01:41:31,496 --> 01:41:34,158
Don't you presume to take on that job,
Mr. President...

1287
01:41:34,232 --> 01:41:36,132
...because you're not qualified.

1288
01:41:36,201 --> 01:41:39,398
Your action in the past year
has bordered on criminal negligence.

1289
01:41:39,471 --> 01:41:43,373
The treaty with the Russians is a violation
of any concept of security.

1290
01:41:43,442 --> 01:41:47,276
You're not a weak sister, Mr. President.
You're a criminally weak sister.

1291
01:41:49,281 --> 01:41:53,183
If you will talk about your oath of office,
I'm here to tell you face to face:

1292
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:56,118
You violated that oath by stripping
the country's muscles...

1293
01:41:56,188 --> 01:41:58,622
...when you played upon the fear
of the people...

1294
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:02,285
...and told them they could remove
that fear by the stroke of a pen.

1295
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:06,387
Then when this nation rejected you
and began militantly to oppose you...

1296
01:42:06,798 --> 01:42:10,325
...you violated that oath by not resigning
and turning the country over...

1297
01:42:10,402 --> 01:42:12,893
...to someone who'd represent the people.

1298
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:16,338
And that would be
General James Mattoon Scott, wouldn't it?

1299
01:42:19,544 --> 01:42:22,775
I don't know whether to laugh
at such megalomania, or simply cry.

1300
01:42:22,848 --> 01:42:27,342
James Mattoon Scott hasn't the slightest
interest in his own glorification...

1301
01:42:27,686 --> 01:42:30,712
...but he does have a concern
about the survival of this country.

1302
01:42:30,789 --> 01:42:32,848
Then, by God, run for office!

1303
01:42:33,525 --> 01:42:37,484
You have a such a fervid, passionate,
evangelical affection for your country.

1304
01:42:37,562 --> 01:42:39,689
Why in God's name don't you have faith...

1305
01:42:39,764 --> 01:42:42,699
...in the system of government
you're so hell-bent to protect?

1306
01:42:42,767 --> 01:42:45,998
You say I've duped the people.
I've bilked them. I've misled them.

1307
01:42:46,071 --> 01:42:48,539
I've stripped them naked
and made them defenseless.

1308
01:42:48,607 --> 01:42:51,007
You accuse me of having lost their faith...

1309
01:42:51,076 --> 01:42:54,534
...and deliberately and criminally
shut my ears to the national voice?

1310
01:42:54,613 --> 01:42:55,910
I do.

1311
01:42:57,849 --> 01:43:00,010
Where the hell have you heard that voice?

1312
01:43:00,085 --> 01:43:01,416
In freight elevators?

1313
01:43:01,486 --> 01:43:04,319
In dark alleys? In secret places
in the dead of night?

1314
01:43:04,823 --> 01:43:08,122
How did that voice seep into a locked room
full of conspirators?

1315
01:43:08,193 --> 01:43:12,061
That's not where you hear the voice
of the people. Not in this republic.

1316
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,655
You want to defend
the United States of America?

1317
01:43:14,733 --> 01:43:18,533
Then defend it with the tools it supplies
you with, it's Constitution.

1318
01:43:18,603 --> 01:43:21,231
You ask for a mandate, General,
from a ballot box.

1319
01:43:21,306 --> 01:43:24,969
You don't steal it after midnight
when the country has it's back turned.

1320
01:43:25,043 --> 01:43:27,034
Are you serious, Mr. President?

1321
01:43:28,313 --> 01:43:30,281
Are you honest-to-God serious?

1322
01:43:33,084 --> 01:43:34,915
I could walk out of here tonight...

1323
01:43:34,986 --> 01:43:37,614
...and offer myself as candidate
for the presidency...

1324
01:43:37,689 --> 01:43:39,748
...and by tomorrow, I'd be at that desk...

1325
01:43:39,824 --> 01:43:42,292
...with precisely the mandate
you hold so dear.

1326
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,591
And what's more, you know it, I know it,
and the country knows it.

1327
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:49,259
Don't say I'd have seized an office
tomorrow without the benefit of support.

1328
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:53,395
If you had the guts to call for a show
of hands, you'd be on an airplane to Ohio.

1329
01:43:53,471 --> 01:43:55,666
You can ask for and get
your show of hands.

1330
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,140
Wait a year and nine months
for an election.

1331
01:43:58,209 --> 01:44:02,373
By then, I don't think there'll be
an electorate, let alone an election.

1332
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:06,810
I think we'll be sitting in our own rubble.
A minimum of 100 million dead.

1333
01:44:07,285 --> 01:44:09,412
And on the gravestone we can carve:

1334
01:44:09,487 --> 01:44:12,888
"They died for Jordan Lyman's
concept of peace."

1335
01:44:32,544 --> 01:44:34,535
Did it ever occur to you that...

1336
01:44:35,113 --> 01:44:37,707
...if you took over this government
by force...

1337
01:44:38,617 --> 01:44:42,280
...you wouldn't have to wait
a year and nine months for the funeral?

1338
01:44:42,787 --> 01:44:47,019
If the Soviet Union saw our government
taken over by a military dictatorship...

1339
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:51,156
...how long would it take them
to break the treaty?

1340
01:44:51,229 --> 01:44:52,890
Possibly even attack us?

1341
01:44:54,432 --> 01:44:57,629
I think perhaps a question of days,
perhaps hours...

1342
01:44:58,637 --> 01:45:00,070
...certainly weeks.

1343
01:45:03,408 --> 01:45:07,276
I want your resignation, General.
I want it tonight. I'm expecting it.

1344
01:45:07,479 --> 01:45:11,848
Along with the other members of the Joint
Chiefs who are involved in this treason.

1345
01:45:12,684 --> 01:45:14,914
I'll tell you quite unequivocally...

1346
01:45:15,453 --> 01:45:18,251
...l'll not tell the reason
for your resignation.

1347
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:22,287
If that were ever made public,
this country would go down the drain.

1348
01:45:23,028 --> 01:45:25,758
- Will you resign, General?
- I will not resign.

1349
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:29,631
I can demand your resignation,
as you well know.

1350
01:45:29,701 --> 01:45:32,226
Demand and be damned.
I will not resign voluntarily.

1351
01:45:32,303 --> 01:45:33,793
Nor will any of the others.

1352
01:45:33,872 --> 01:45:36,534
But what I will do is take this issue
to the people.

1353
01:45:36,608 --> 01:45:38,200
I'll demand a public platform.

1354
01:45:38,777 --> 01:45:41,837
Then we'll see which one of us
the United States will follow.

1355
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:50,752
Anything else...

1356
01:45:53,058 --> 01:45:54,116
...Mr. President?

1357
01:45:59,798 --> 01:46:02,323
I've called a press conference
for tomorrow.

1358
01:46:04,669 --> 01:46:07,934
I'll announce that I've asked for
all of your resignations.

1359
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,932
I'll use as a reason...

1360
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,778
...our differences over the treaty.

1361
01:46:23,354 --> 01:46:26,221
Without proof,
you couldn't possibly say otherwise.

1362
01:46:26,324 --> 01:46:28,224
You simply wouldn't dare.

1363
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,125
I'm going to fight you.

1364
01:47:27,585 --> 01:47:30,782
I'm sorry, Jiggs.
Return them to Miss Holbrook.

1365
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:09,360
This will be delivered at:00 tonight
on all major networks.

1366
01:48:09,427 --> 01:48:11,486
I'll be taping it in one hour.

1367
01:48:12,997 --> 01:48:14,589
This is strong stuff, General.

1368
01:48:14,666 --> 01:48:16,099
Thank you, General.

1369
01:48:18,403 --> 01:48:23,340
Are you sure that he won't use this
press conference to make any accusations?

1370
01:48:23,842 --> 01:48:28,336
He'll use this press conference to support
a position that is totally indefensible.

1371
01:48:30,915 --> 01:48:34,908
General, if he accuses us of sedition,
whether he has the proof or not...

1372
01:48:36,621 --> 01:48:38,282
...this could be a sticky business.

1373
01:48:38,356 --> 01:48:40,085
Jordan Lyman is finished...

1374
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:44,588
...no matter what he says during his press
conference, no matter what he does after.

1375
01:48:44,696 --> 01:48:49,156
An educated guess is that within a week
there'll be a move for impeachment.

1376
01:48:49,234 --> 01:48:50,462
That's it, gentlemen.

1377
01:48:50,535 --> 01:48:54,164
You're welcome to stay here and watch
on television. I'll be at the studio.

1378
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,265
Colonel Murdock will be in touch with me
if I'm needed.

1379
01:48:57,342 --> 01:48:58,331
Good day.

1380
01:49:17,629 --> 01:49:20,894
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.</i>

1381
01:49:30,608 --> 01:49:32,576
<i>All right, gentlemen. Let's begin.</i>

1382
01:49:33,845 --> 01:49:37,008
<i>The Gallup Poll of last week
indicated what appears to be...</i>

1383
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:40,642
<i>... a very universal rejection
of your entire political philosophy.</i>

1384
01:49:40,718 --> 01:49:44,745
<i>The nuclear treaty with the Soviets.
Would you comment on that?</i>

1385
01:49:44,822 --> 01:49:47,256
<i>Insofar as the treaty is concerned...</i>

1386
01:49:48,059 --> 01:49:52,155
<i>... my reasons for asking that it be ratified
have been stated and re-stated.</i>

1387
01:49:53,598 --> 01:49:56,066
<i>We have reached a point on this earth...</i>

1388
01:50:01,706 --> 01:50:03,901
<i>Excuse mejust a moment, gentlemen.</i>

1389
01:50:11,282 --> 01:50:13,307
Jordie, you better talk to this fellow.

1390
01:50:13,384 --> 01:50:15,909
This is Henry Whitney
from our embassy in Madrid.

1391
01:50:15,987 --> 01:50:17,511
He brought this.

1392
01:50:26,597 --> 01:50:30,033
I'm the only one who's read that paper.
Nobody knows I'm here.

1393
01:50:32,003 --> 01:50:34,494
Delay the press conference for a half hour.

1394
01:50:35,273 --> 01:50:39,710
You are never to disclose or even hint at
the existence of this paper, Mr. Whitney.

1395
01:50:39,777 --> 01:50:41,677
I emphasize the word "never."

1396
01:50:41,746 --> 01:50:44,112
- Ray, have this Photostatted.
- Yes, sir.

1397
01:50:45,049 --> 01:50:48,348
Colonel Casey, see that Scott
and the others get copies right away.

1398
01:50:48,419 --> 01:50:49,408
Yes, sir.

1399
01:51:09,941 --> 01:51:12,705
That's a signed statement
from Admiral Barnswell.

1400
01:51:17,215 --> 01:51:20,810
You're a night crawler, Colonel.
A peddler. You sell information.

1401
01:51:21,386 --> 01:51:24,480
Are you sufficiently up on your Bible
to know who Judas was?

1402
01:51:27,358 --> 01:51:30,589
I suggest you read that letter, sir.
It's from the President.

1403
01:51:30,661 --> 01:51:32,253
I asked you a question.

1404
01:51:34,732 --> 01:51:36,563
Are you ordering me to answer, sir?

1405
01:51:36,634 --> 01:51:37,498
I am.

1406
01:51:41,005 --> 01:51:42,768
Yes, I know who Judas was.

1407
01:51:44,175 --> 01:51:46,575
He was a man I worked for and admired...

1408
01:51:46,811 --> 01:51:49,439
...until he disgraced the four stars
on his uniform.

1409
01:51:59,624 --> 01:52:01,990
<i>Mr. President, for the past 48 hours...</i>

1410
01:52:02,393 --> 01:52:06,727
<i>... there has been considerable scuttlebutt
concerning the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</i>

1411
01:52:06,998 --> 01:52:11,401
<i>There have been rumors that there is to be
some sort of mass resignation.</i>

1412
01:52:11,936 --> 01:52:14,302
<i>Would you care to comment on that, sir?</i>

1413
01:52:14,972 --> 01:52:19,375
<i>I'll answer that, but I'd like to preface
with a few other comments.</i>

1414
01:52:21,012 --> 01:52:22,343
<i>In a democracy...</i>

1415
01:52:23,581 --> 01:52:27,745
<i>... once the president and the Senate,
as responsible authorities...</i>

1416
01:52:28,653 --> 01:52:32,089
<i>... make a decision, then debate
and opposition among the military...</i>

1417
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:36,124
<i>... who have opposed this treaty
from the outset, must come to an end.</i>

1418
01:52:38,096 --> 01:52:39,688
<i>This is the way in war.</i>

1419
01:52:40,264 --> 01:52:44,030
<i>So it also must be in the councils
of government here in Washington.</i>

1420
01:52:44,435 --> 01:52:46,027
<i>I have had no choice...</i>

1421
01:52:46,637 --> 01:52:50,664
<i>... but to ask for the resignation
of General James Scott.</i>

1422
01:52:52,577 --> 01:52:57,276
<i>At the same time, I have asked
for the resignations of three other officers:</i>

1423
01:52:58,282 --> 01:53:00,910
<i>General Hardesty and
General Dieffenbach...</i>

1424
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,587
<i>... the Chiefs of Staff
of the Air Force and Army...</i>

1425
01:53:03,654 --> 01:53:06,680
<i>... and General Riley,
Commandant of the Marine Corps.</i>

1426
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:12,252
Yes, I've already heard. He told me so.

1427
01:53:16,534 --> 01:53:18,331
General, I'll be right out.

1428
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:27,944
General, all hell's broken loose.

1429
01:53:28,779 --> 01:53:32,579
General, he's asked them to resign.
Hardesty, Dieffenbach, Riley and yourself.

1430
01:53:32,650 --> 01:53:34,618
Riley called here. He tried to reach you.

1431
01:53:34,685 --> 01:53:36,915
Somehow Lyman got a hold
of Barnswell's statement.

1432
01:53:36,988 --> 01:53:39,354
It implicated all of us.
Names, dates, the works.

1433
01:53:39,423 --> 01:53:41,323
Jim, what are we going to do?

1434
01:53:41,459 --> 01:53:44,087
When do we tape?
You got my speech, didn't you?

1435
01:53:44,162 --> 01:53:48,326
Yes, but when this came out minutes ago,
the five network vice-presidents called me.

1436
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:50,390
Do I get on the air or don't I?

1437
01:53:50,468 --> 01:53:54,666
We've gone along with you all the way,
but for God's sake, we're in jeopardy now.

1438
01:53:54,739 --> 01:53:56,604
The last thing we want is publicity.

1439
01:53:56,674 --> 01:53:58,073
Shut up, Prentice.

1440
01:53:58,409 --> 01:53:59,398
Harold?

1441
01:53:59,577 --> 01:54:01,670
General, it's out of my hands now.

1442
01:54:03,948 --> 01:54:05,142
What will you do?

1443
01:54:05,216 --> 01:54:07,946
Go to Mount Thunder and cut in
on the television networks.

1444
01:54:08,019 --> 01:54:10,613
- He's asked for your...
- He won't get them!

1445
01:54:10,688 --> 01:54:14,055
Dieffenbach, Riley and Hardesty are made
of sterner stuff than you.

1446
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:16,184
- General, be realistic.
- Go to hell!

1447
01:54:19,463 --> 01:54:22,023
<i>I can comment on that to this extent.</i>

1448
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:28,231
<i>Americans, traditionally and historically,
have given vent to their views.</i>

1449
01:54:29,407 --> 01:54:32,240
<i>On the day that this government
does anything arbitrarily...</i>

1450
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:35,108
<i>... to stifle those views,
it will have to change form.</i>

1451
01:54:35,179 --> 01:54:37,044
<i>It will cease to be a democracy.</i>

1452
01:54:37,281 --> 01:54:40,717
<i>And I can state quite frankly
that this day will not come.</i>

1453
01:54:48,492 --> 01:54:51,393
<i>Gentlemen, the papersjust handed me...</i>

1454
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:53,997
<i>... are the resignations...</i>

1455
01:54:54,398 --> 01:54:57,060
<i>... of Generals Hardesty, Riley,
and Dieffenbach.</i>

1456
01:54:58,703 --> 01:55:00,261
<i>I'll repeat that, gentlemen.</i>

1457
01:55:00,338 --> 01:55:05,241
<i>These three officers havejust officially
tendered their resignations.</i>

1458
01:55:05,843 --> 01:55:09,210
<i>Their statements will be made public
after this conference.</i>

1459
01:55:09,447 --> 01:55:11,847
<i>Before we have any further questions...</i>

1460
01:55:12,683 --> 01:55:14,981
<i>... may I insert these comments?</i>

1461
01:55:15,486 --> 01:55:19,513
<i>The point of this treaty, as I've reiterated
on a number of occasions...</i>

1462
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:21,985
<i>... is that in every true sense...</i>

1463
01:55:22,093 --> 01:55:26,154
<i>... we force ourselves gradually
to step away from an offensive posture.</i>

1464
01:55:28,432 --> 01:55:29,729
I'm sorry, sir.

1465
01:55:31,369 --> 01:55:32,631
Where to, sir?

1466
01:55:37,808 --> 01:55:38,740
Sir?

1467
01:55:44,048 --> 01:55:45,276
Take me home.

1468
01:55:52,456 --> 01:55:54,686
Your General's just been shot down.

1469
01:55:55,726 --> 01:55:56,658
Yes.

1470
01:56:00,965 --> 01:56:02,557
Were those the bullets?

1471
01:56:04,635 --> 01:56:06,967
They might have been, but they weren't.

1472
01:56:12,343 --> 01:56:14,208
- Ellie.
- Yes?

1473
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:17,779
Another rain check?

1474
01:56:20,985 --> 01:56:23,681
Tuck it somewhere safe,
where you won't forget.

1475
01:56:28,059 --> 01:56:31,290
There has been abroad in this land
in recent months...

1476
01:56:31,362 --> 01:56:35,321
...a whisper that we have somehow
lost our greatness...

1477
01:56:36,534 --> 01:56:39,765
...that we do not have the strength
to win without war...

1478
01:56:40,838 --> 01:56:43,306
...the struggles for liberty
throughout the world.

1479
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:45,675
This is slander...

1480
01:56:46,911 --> 01:56:49,072
...because our country is strong...

1481
01:56:49,347 --> 01:56:51,508
...strong enough to be a peacemaker.

1482
01:56:52,116 --> 01:56:54,812
It is proud. Proud enough to be patient.

1483
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:59,449
The whisperers, the detractors,
the violent men are wrong.

1484
01:57:00,624 --> 01:57:05,527
We will remain strong and proud,
peaceful and patient...

1485
01:57:06,764 --> 01:57:09,426
...and we will see a day
when on this earth...

1486
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:13,567
...all men will walk out
of the long tunnels of tyranny...

1487
01:57:15,172 --> 01:57:17,538
...into the bright sunshine of freedom.

1488
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:27,314
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, that was
the President of the United States.</i>
