1
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>In what looks to be another battle
in the ongoing drug wars</i>

2
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:25,063
<i>that have plagued the region
in the recent months including</i>

3
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,564
<i>the murder of three US ambassadors
in Ciudad Juárez</i>

4
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>and the shocking disappearance of
California's very own drug czar, Millard Hanson. </i>

5
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:31,764
<i>How long has it been since
you last confession?</i>

6
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,524
I can't remember.

7
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:39,644
What would you like to confess?

8
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,884
I wanna make a donation.

9
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:51,124
Please, we have a poor box
outside of this booth.

10
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,604
Right.

11
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,644
You're right.

12
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,724
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,404
There's no need to be sorry.

14
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,444
Will you do something for me, father?

15
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,963
What is it, my son?

16
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,924
Forgive me.

17
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:26,323
No!

18
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:11,884
You're so good, yeah.

19
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,044
Good boy.

20
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,444
Yeah.

21
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:10,964
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Hi.

22
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,524
So, what do you wanna do?

23
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:24,524
Don't worry about it.
Something's planned for you.

24
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,963
Yes?

25
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,443
Oh my, that dog is huge.

26
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:33,604
Oh wait, I got a little surprise
for you in the parking lot.

27
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,564
So I gotta cover those playboy eyes.

28
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,604
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,083
Alright, watch your step
Don't wind up hurting yourself.

30
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:44,564
Almost there.

31
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:48,644
What?

32
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:51,729
You got us new bikes?

33
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:53,963
Yeah, and a bike rack installed
by yours truly.

34
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,044
Ah, I can see that that is
your handiwork.

35
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:01,084
Yeah, it's just a loose screw,
I can fix it later.

36
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,883
Thank you.

37
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,124
Now, it's time for gift number two.

38
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:11,204
- There's another one?
- Yeah.

39
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,364
It's not in there, silly.

40
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:17,604
- Gotta go for a little drive.
- Oh, a drive thing?

41
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:20,684
- Give me a hint.
- No. Get in the car.

42
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,324
You can take it.

43
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:49,644
No, I...

44
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:52,564
I promised no work tonight.

45
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,164
Here.

46
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,924
Adios. No more calls.

47
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,484
No more calls.

48
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,124
Why are we stopping?

49
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:39,884
Open it.

50
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:41,164
What?

51
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,004
What is this?

52
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,364
It's a fingerprint key.

53
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,444
It's the latest in home security.

54
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,724
David, whose house is this?

55
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,044
It's ours.

56
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,243
What?

57
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,364
Now it's your turn.

58
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:48,964
That's weird.

59
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,844
We'll have to get you your own.

60
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,364
Just went into foreclosure.

61
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,364
It's not even on the market yet.

62
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,884
I pulled a few strings at the bank.

63
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,484
And we are getting this place at
an absolute steal.

64
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,884
Of course, I didn't sign the final
paperwork yet.

65
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:20,764
I was kind of hoping we could
do that tonight.

66
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,884
Together.

67
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,924
Morgan, Morgan's and Loan he's the one
that hooked me up with a keypad.

68
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,684
I couldn't get the power on.

69
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:33,164
Don't have any connections to
the power company.

70
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,404
I had a couple guys come in

71
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,844
and pack up what the previous
owner left behind.

72
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:48,484
You know what, wait till you see
the pool out back.

73
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,804
And if you like any of the art

74
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,724
it's ours.

75
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,763
Comes with the house.

76
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:01,564
I have no idea why there's a stove
in here but...

77
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,084
I know you love antiques.

78
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,644
Oh, and they're also building a school
three blocks away from here.

79
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:12,484
Baby, this is the house we've always
dreamed about.

80
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,724
Babe, I...

81
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,324
I can tear this up right now.

82
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:24,809
I love it.

83
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:26,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

84
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,524
- Pen.
- Okay.

85
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:55,044
We... are officially... homeowners.

86
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,564
- Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
- Yes.

87
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,684
Talk about your own security systems, huh?

88
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,164
- What?
- Yeah, check it out.

89
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,764
We got a custom designed system

90
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,884
that covers 360 degrees of the premises.

91
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,244
How is this running without any power?

92
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,204
Oh, the system has its own power line.

93
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:23,844
It also comes with a fully automatic MTS.

94
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,004
MTS?

95
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,964
Movement Tracking System.

96
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,284
What?

97
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:33,244
Is that Trish's car?
What is she doing here?

98
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:35,684
No idea.

99
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:41,323
Love the place!

100
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:43,489
What are you doing here?

101
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:46,004
Well, the front door was wide open.

102
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,163
And David showed me pictures
yesterday of the house

103
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,404
and I found the perfect
housewarming gift.

104
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,804
Oh wait, it's official, right?
You're taking the house?

105
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,203
Yeah.

106
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,644
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:00,644
Thank you.

108
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:05,884
Oh, that is the latest piece of this hot
new artist showing at my gallery.

109
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:11,324
This is a far cry from that shit box you guys
were held onto on the north side, huh?

110
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,444
I know.

111
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:16,724
Oh, and I expect a jacuzzi and
a wet bar out here very soon.

112
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:18,843
Deal.

113
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,244
- Bye!
- Wait, why you leaving so early?

114
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,644
I'm sure you guys have some
celebrating to do

115
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:32,284
and I have drinks and clients
and then a hot date

116
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,164
with "Michelangelo".

117
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:34,923
Oh, god.

118
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,884
- I love you, girl.
- Love you.

119
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,803
David, great job.

120
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,284
Thank you.
That girl's crazy.

121
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:43,444
I know she is.

122
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,923
Oh, poor thing. They left you
all alone out there.

123
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,484
We're gonna pick up some bird feeder
in the morning.

124
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,444
Trish.

125
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:02,004
- Ah, she got timing.
- I know.

126
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,564
Hi.

127
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:06,729
Hello.

128
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:09,924
I saw your SUV out in front.
I came to check in.

129
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,924
Can I help you, folks?

130
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,884
David Nash.
This is my wife.

131
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,444
- Amy.
- Ray.

132
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:18,444
So, you guys thinking of
buying the place or...

133
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,484
We are.

134
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:21,444
Well, we just did.

135
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,409
Welcome to the neighborhood.

136
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:25,683
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

137
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,404
You know, I always wanted to see
the inside of this place.

138
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,224
Do you mind if I just...

139
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,004
- Oh, go for it.
- Thank you.

140
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:37,743
- Wow, this is nice... exposed brick.
- Yeah, we like it.

141
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,124
So you're a Buckeye?

142
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,408
Yeah.
How did you know?

143
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,844
Sticker. Ohio sticker on the windshield.

144
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:45,324
Ah, of course.

145
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:46,443
So that's where you met?

146
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:47,923
Yeah, freshman year.

147
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,244
Co-ed dorms.

148
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,084
What line of work you in, David?

149
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,763
I'm over at Nitrom Trust.

150
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,923
Oh, what do you do there?

151
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,084
I specialize in city redevelopment

152
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:02,084
You know turning porch hounging
neighborhoods into...

153
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,123
- One like this one? Right, right?
- Exactly.

154
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:07,404
Alright well, I better get going.

155
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,363
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

156
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:14,084
You know it's always... nice to have
good people devoted to the block.

157
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:15,724
Thanks.

158
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:17,209
You guys take care.

159
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:19,164
- You as well.
- Yeah.

160
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:41,923
Make a wish.

161
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:50,244
- What did you wish for?
- I can't tell.

162
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,004
Happy birthday!

163
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:01,844
<i>Thank you. </i>

164
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,924
<i>It's really sweet. </i>

165
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,164
<i>I just want you to be happy, baby. </i>

166
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,284
It's so peaceful and quiet here.

167
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,963
That's the idea.
Now we can spend more time together.

168
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,204
I've heard that before.

169
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:29,444
A little bit different now, you'll see.

170
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,484
I want a tape recorder.
I want to get this on a record.

171
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,124
You think you got jokes?

172
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:37,004
Yes.

173
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:40,884
What is that?

174
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,803
I don't know, it was probably a
little mouse or

175
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,844
I don't know.

176
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,164
What the hell is that?

177
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:53,924
Fine.

178
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,684
Check this out.

179
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:07,884
It seems like we might have a little
mouse issue up in here.

180
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:13,204
Yeah, you know what, I'll call
the exterminator tomorrow.

181
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:16,404
and get this place bug gone
before we move in.

182
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:20,803
It looks like we have a busy day tomorrow.

183
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,484
We should probably get going.

184
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,764
Hold up.

185
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:29,924
I can think of at least one thing
we could do.

186
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:32,124
Really?

187
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,444
It's too bad we don't have any furniture.

188
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,044
Luckily

189
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,164
I came prepared.

190
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:43,764
I doubt there's any luck involved with that.

191
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,604
A scratch.

192
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,044
<i>It's awful how dirty this is. </i>

193
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:00,164
What do you think of his nurse sinks?

194
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,884
Oh my god!

195
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,243
What is this?

196
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:12,204
I think it's heroin.

197
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:28,203
Hey!

198
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:30,684
Mr. and mrs. Nash.

199
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,483
- Richard?
- Ray.

200
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,483
- Ray, sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

201
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,564
Is everything okay?

202
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,603
No. We found something in the house.

203
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:41,044
Really?

204
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,363
What did you find?

205
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:45,924
We need to call the cops.

206
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,364
I was...

207
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,564
I was really hoping you weren't
goin' to say that, David.

208
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:56,524
See, I bet somebody twenty dollars

209
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,163
that you two wouldn't find that
stash tonight.

210
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,244
I guess I lost.

211
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,724
Hey, you can just take it.
We don't need to go back in there.

212
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,284
It's all yours.

213
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:12,484
Really?

214
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:17,564
So, you guys gonna wait upfront?
With your eyes closed?

215
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,764
Count to a thousand for me?

216
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:22,044
Get inside!

217
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:28,164
Let's go!

218
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,764
Fuck!

219
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:34,923
Shit!

220
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,524
- The back door! Back door!
- Shit!

221
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:19,884
- Get a knife or something!
- Okay.

222
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,843
There's nothing in here.

223
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:44,324
No!

224
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:54,883
How did you do this?

225
00:21:58,123 --> 00:21:59,844
I hit the switch.

226
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,524
Oh my god, David!

227
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,844
Oh my god!

228
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,243
Okay, good.

229
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:13,523
I'm okay.

230
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,004
I'm okay.

231
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:19,084
I just need my breath.

232
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:39,524
What is this place?

233
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:17,444
They dropped the barricade.

234
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,163
What do we do now?

235
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,204
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

236
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:23,004
Without a keypad we can't get in there.

237
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:25,284
We need the kid alive.

238
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,564
What are you doing?

239
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,803
Things have escalated here.

240
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,784
It's your first day.

241
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,604
Hey, go ahead.

242
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,644
Hit the panic button.

243
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:35,844
Call it in.

244
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:39,484
It's gonna look bad on both of us.

245
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,603
Let's just finish our business here.

246
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:46,924
And then you and I can stab each other
in the backs later. Okay?

247
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:13,163
It looks like it stopped bleeding.

248
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:15,844
You should be fine.

249
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,564
Couldn't you pick us a house with
a white picket fence?

250
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:48,403
Good line.

251
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,444
They knew...

252
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:01,844
Knew what?

253
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:04,723
When we walked out that front door

254
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:08,564
they knew we were calling the cops.

255
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:12,684
- How did they know we were leaving?
- I have no idea.

256
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,844
Unless...

257
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:40,284
<i>You know, I've always wanted to see...
the inside of this place, do you mind if I just... </i>

258
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:44,724
<i>This is nice...
exposed brick. </i>

259
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,244
They've been listening to us all night.

260
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,124
Oh my god!

261
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,884
There goes our bug.

262
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:36,284
I think we're safe as long as
we stay in the house.

263
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:40,164
Safe?
They have automatic weapons.

264
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,564
You see that?

265
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:31,364
Walls, windows or doors...
they're all bulletproof.

266
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,364
This whole place...

267
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:38,644
is fortified.

268
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:41,404
Drug dealers have the tendency

269
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:44,884
to get paranoid about the competition
looking out their stash.

270
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:47,844
How do you know that?

271
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:51,763
Five seasons of "The Wire".

272
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:56,444
It doesn't make sense, why would drug dealers
foreclose on a stash house?

273
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:03,924
No clue.

274
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:19,724
What are you looking for?

275
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:22,684
Can you hold that?

276
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:28,924
Maybe...

277
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,004
they haven't shut off...

278
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,884
the phone line.

279
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:55,084
Anything?

280
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,564
- They got the junction box.
- What?

281
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,844
They destroyed the junction box!

282
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:11,083
What?
Oh my god!

283
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:13,724
Okay, okay.

284
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:15,064
We have to stay calm.

285
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,364
Tell me, what are we gonna do?

286
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,044
Listen to me!

287
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,764
You gotta calm down.

288
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:23,124
Hey, look at me...
look at me, calm down.

289
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:28,124
This is what I do, baby... crisis management.
I solve problems everyday.

290
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,284
I'm gonna get us out of here.

291
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:32,724
This is not an accounting error.
There are men out there trying to kill us!

292
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:34,803
There is a way out of here.
There has to be.

293
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:39,724
You just... You just have to let me think.
Okay, baby?

294
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:41,643
Okay.

295
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:03,524
They're here for the stash so we just
give them what they want.

296
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,404
Then after this?

297
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,924
They leave.

298
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:39,643
Something on your mind?

299
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,003
The stash.

300
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,763
All of it!

301
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,643
Come on.

302
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:00,003
Dammit.

303
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,363
There's some good stuff in here.

304
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:12,524
Please go!

305
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,084
- I think it's what they want.
- Really?

306
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,203
What are they doing?

307
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:37,403
What gave you the impression
I came here for that poison?

308
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:40,323
Just tell me what you want.
I'll get it for you.

309
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,964
Never negotiate with something
you can't deliver.

310
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:55,404
They're not gonna leave.

311
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:05,284
Amy!

312
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,564
They're gonna find a way in here.

313
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:27,924
No babe, look at me.

314
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:33,444
If they knew a way in
they would've found it by now.

315
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,203
Okay.

316
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:41,484
I won't let anything happen to you.

317
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,244
It's gonna be okay.

318
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:04,284
Two bags.

319
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:06,564
It's not a lot of product for a stash house.

320
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,449
This was more like a weed station.

321
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:10,883
For monthly loads,
not a lot of traffic.

322
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,324
Off the radar.

323
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,204
That's why they kept the package here.

324
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,084
It's been a while though.

325
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:18,803
Any chance they could find it?

326
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:22,123
It doesn't matter at this point.

327
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:30,404
What's so funny?

328
00:33:32,284 --> 00:33:37,084
Oh nothing. Just something a friend south
of the border calls you, that's all.

329
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:38,284
Let's hear it.

330
00:33:38,604 --> 00:33:40,524
<i>Dijo de puta. </i>

331
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,924
They say anything else?

332
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:52,524
Just that after ten years in the field,

333
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,804
you still bet a thousand.

334
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:56,604
Which I guess...

335
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:59,964
makes you worth the trouble.

336
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:05,844
Keep an eye on them.

337
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,164
Where you going?

338
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:12,164
Fishing.

339
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,644
We need to make a run for it.

340
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:22,443
No way.

341
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,324
I can make it over that fence.

342
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,444
You forget about their guns?

343
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:30,644
You can't outrun a bullet.

344
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:33,844
I can make it.

345
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:38,883
It's too risky!

346
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,923
Twenty seconds, that's all I need.
I'm fast.

347
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:45,164
- They'll hear you as soon as you hit that fence.
- Then you'll distract them with noise in the front.

348
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:47,684
Amy...

349
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:50,524
These guys... they're professionals.

350
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,963
Our best bet is to stay here

351
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,044
and just try to ride it out.

352
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:57,924
Twenty seconds.

353
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,044
If they make a move stall them.

354
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:17,363
- I can't stop you from doing this, can I?
- No way.

355
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:25,084
- Twenty seconds.
- No, stop!

356
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,404
Come on!

357
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,604
No!

358
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,964
Shit... shit!

359
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,284
No, no!

360
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:22,524
He's coming!

361
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,724
Don't make this worse.

362
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:58,084
<i>Hey!</i>

363
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:02,124
<i>Are you listening in there?</i>

364
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:06,723
<i>Open this door now and your
husband lives. </i>

365
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:23,164
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

366
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:27,004
<i>My partner is gonna shoot to kill,
unless you open this door. </i>

367
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,484
<i>This is one of those true die moments. </i>

368
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:39,804
<i>Don't let us kill your husband. </i>

369
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:54,483
David!

370
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:33,483
Fuck!

371
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:25,044
I wonder where David could be.

372
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:34,723
Fuck!

373
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:36,804
You...

374
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:42,404
David!

375
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:51,684
Amy!

376
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,884
Oh my god!

377
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,524
You okay?

378
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:10,723
Yeah, baby.

379
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:20,604
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm very much alive, baby.

380
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:45,723
Your hand...

381
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,123
- Oh my god, David!
- It's alright, baby.

382
00:42:07,404 --> 00:42:08,643
What was that?

383
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:26,524
What is that?

384
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:44,403
Where is that coming from?

385
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,403
He's climbing.

386
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,484
Where are you going?

387
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:24,684
He's trying to get into the chimney.

388
00:43:24,884 --> 00:43:27,764
Maybe he's looking for a way to slide down.

389
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:30,804
You hear that?

390
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,964
Sounds like he's drilling into the roof.

391
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:37,323
Doesn't sound like drilling.

392
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:39,804
- What does it sound like then?
- I don't know.

393
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:45,404
Probably the chimney cap?

394
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:50,764
Get back!

395
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:20,844
Come on!

396
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:25,484
Adios, amigo.

397
00:44:29,323 --> 00:44:30,284
Get down!

398
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:53,804
Stupid son of a bitch!

399
00:44:59,644 --> 00:45:01,164
Are you hurt?

400
00:45:03,444 --> 00:45:06,324
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know.

401
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:22,483
You smell like chimney.

402
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:25,203
Okay.

403
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,963
Stay here.

404
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,523
Do you think the neighbors
heard something?

405
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:36,524
Not through these walls.

406
00:46:05,324 --> 00:46:07,244
You son of a bitch!

407
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:26,844
I think I got one of them.

408
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:31,323
I don't hear anything.

409
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:05,044
You bitch!
I'll kill you!

410
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:11,923
You piece of shit!

411
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:21,404
Where is he going?

412
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:09,204
I'm sorry.

413
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:15,084
What for?

414
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:20,044
Everything.
Tonight.

415
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:23,324
Bringing you here.

416
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:26,464
I should've said no.

417
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:28,244
For the house?

418
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:32,204
Before...

419
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:34,563
I should've never left Ohio.

420
00:48:36,844 --> 00:48:40,684
This is an opportunity for us
to build a better life.

421
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,444
No, David.

422
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:45,483
This was an opportunity for you
to build your career.

423
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:47,683
That's it.

424
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,644
We were so happy.

425
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:22,283
Whatever they want,
is hidden in this house.

426
00:49:25,644 --> 00:49:27,084
Where are you going?

427
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,483
To find what they're looking for.

428
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:49,883
<i>Ah... son of a bitch got me in the neck.
It was a lucky shot. </i>

429
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:52,003
It won't happen again.

430
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:55,363
You're done here!

431
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,483
Calling Khulia Khan?

432
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:01,484
I wouldn't do that.

433
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,004
I'm doing it!

434
00:50:03,444 --> 00:50:08,243
Making that call only shortens
your life by a couple of hours.

435
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:11,284
Yeah.

436
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:12,684
Near retirement?

437
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,163
I'm sorry to say, it's been rejected.

438
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:20,323
What do you know about that?

439
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,644
Only what our friends down south told me.

440
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:28,524
There's too many company secrets
in that big fat head of yours.

441
00:50:28,884 --> 00:50:31,484
Go ahead, make the call and
you know what...

442
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:34,404
Call the Juárez cartel while you're at it.

443
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:37,124
The decision's been made
across the border, amigo.

444
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:41,124
You... won't live to see the sunrise.
Everyone...

445
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,643
has an expiration date.

446
00:50:43,723 --> 00:50:46,283
Go ahead! Get it over with!

447
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:53,883
It's tempting.

448
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:56,284
But...

449
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:59,523
there are a couple colombians...

450
00:51:00,004 --> 00:51:01,924
waiting outside your house.

451
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:05,244
That have been paid handsomely,
for that privilege.

452
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:06,643
Now...

453
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:10,284
I've got a proposition for you.

454
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,324
<i>You help me retrieve that package</i>

455
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:16,764
<i>and I'll let you walk out of here with the H. </i>

456
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:20,323
<i>We've got a deal?</i>

457
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:43,764
Try behind there.

458
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:39,203
There's something behind this wall.

459
00:53:41,564 --> 00:53:43,484
This' part of the basement?

460
00:53:43,644 --> 00:53:45,564
No, it's off the property now.

461
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:04,924
Payables.

462
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:07,604
Receivables.

463
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:11,843
And this is...
this is all accounting figures.

464
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:18,803
I think this is a counting room.

465
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,324
Mini Corp.

466
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,284
What do you think that is?

467
00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:25,843
I don't know.

468
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:36,804
They have contract work for these guys.

469
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:40,203
Paid once a month, like clockwork.

470
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:48,004
Close for... at least three years.

471
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:50,444
You know...

472
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:52,963
I read this article

473
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:55,004
about these ex-special forces types that were...

474
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,884
working with cartels.

475
00:55:57,603 --> 00:56:01,444
The kind of guys who would have
access to weapons and grenades.

476
00:56:07,803 --> 00:56:09,204
You hear that?

477
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:21,323
The scratching sound's back.

478
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,404
What is that?

479
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:28,244
I don't know.
It's definitely not a mouse.

480
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,724
It's locked or stuck or something.

481
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:50,244
Do you have your USB key with you?

482
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,284
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:05,604
Oh my gosh.
What is this?

484
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:08,924
Maybe it's what they're looking for.

485
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,324
There's something in there.

486
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,323
What the hell is that?

487
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:46,604
It's a man.

488
00:57:46,644 --> 00:57:47,603
What?

489
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:50,563
Yeah, it's a man in there.

490
00:58:01,524 --> 00:58:02,483
Oh my gosh!

491
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:10,404
Turn around, turn around.

492
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:13,644
On three. One, two, three!

493
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:25,364
How long do you think he's been in there?

494
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:28,524
I don't know.
For a while.

495
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:32,404
He looks familiar.

496
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:34,403
Hold on, wait here.

497
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,564
Listen, something's come up.

498
00:58:52,163 --> 00:58:53,123
Yes.

499
00:58:54,084 --> 00:58:56,684
Yes, remember that place we talked about?

500
00:58:57,084 --> 00:58:59,963
You need to meet me there, tonight.

501
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:01,403
Yeah.

502
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:04,803
Everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah.

503
00:59:07,604 --> 00:59:11,444
I love you too.

504
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:23,204
I found this.
Let's bring it up to slice.

505
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:28,644
- What?
- That's him.

506
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,764
Millard Hanson.
He's some kind of...

507
00:59:32,203 --> 00:59:35,043
state drug czar.

508
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:48,443
We can't hand him over to them, okay?

509
00:59:48,724 --> 00:59:50,164
Yeah, I know.

510
01:00:17,923 --> 01:00:19,643
Where's your partner?

511
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,523
Licks his wounds.

512
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:24,883
You made things interesting with
that firework show.

513
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:27,043
What do you want?

514
01:00:29,323 --> 01:00:30,763
At this point...

515
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:32,724
I'm just trying to get home to my wife.

516
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:33,964
Yeah?

517
01:00:35,004 --> 01:00:36,403
'She know what you do?

518
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,203
Does yours?

519
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:41,523
I don't hide things from my wife.

520
01:00:42,803 --> 01:00:44,244
Really?

521
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,204
Then she knows the truth, how you happen
to stumble upon this house.

522
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:54,004
Previous owner here worked
for a drug cartel.

523
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:55,963
He was a housekeeper.

524
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,403
It's an easy gig.

525
01:00:57,443 --> 01:00:59,644
Requires just a signature on the deed

526
01:00:59,683 --> 01:01:02,563
and two phone calls a month
to his employers.

527
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:05,483
<i>But yesterday, the housekeeper
missed his call. </i>

528
01:01:05,883 --> 01:01:08,283
The housekeeper never misses a call.

529
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:09,729
<i>It turned out... </i>

530
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:13,683
<i>he decorated the inside of a
confessional booth with his brain matter. </i>

531
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:16,849
Now, you work for the bank David.

532
01:01:16,883 --> 01:01:19,284
You have no doubt heard
about the suicide.

533
01:01:20,604 --> 01:01:22,244
Question is...

534
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:25,004
Did you tell the wife?

535
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:29,563
We all have our secrets, David.

536
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,964
Your lives aren't the only ones in the line
here tonight.

537
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,684
My old man...

538
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,364
went out in a barcalounger,

539
01:01:51,364 --> 01:01:53,443
way before his time.

540
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,164
That's not gonna be me.

541
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:59,124
David.

542
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:03,843
Just open the door and we can
all go home.

543
01:02:09,284 --> 01:02:11,484
Go ahead, just open the door.

544
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:20,844
Bitch!

545
01:03:29,844 --> 01:03:31,083
<i>Bitch!</i>

546
01:03:51,284 --> 01:03:52,523
<i>I can't find them. </i>

547
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,684
Take care of business first.

548
01:04:02,124 --> 01:04:04,043
And worry about the couple later.

549
01:04:47,524 --> 01:04:49,444
So what's the story with the package?

550
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,764
We're looking for somebody with
a ransom.

551
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:54,764
- How much did they ask?
- Nothing.

552
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:59,044
They wanted to trade him for a couple
cartel bosses up in San Quentin.

553
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,723
They're cutting into the floor bars.

554
01:05:31,924 --> 01:05:33,764
They're looking for him.

555
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:42,523
They never build this place they didn't
wanna be able to see out, right?

556
01:05:42,724 --> 01:05:44,643
There's gotta be something
hidden in here.

557
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,315
What?

558
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,683
I can see them! They're cutting into the hedge.

559
01:05:58,124 --> 01:06:01,283
It's not gonna take too long to figure out
he's not in there

560
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:03,564
and then they'll come looking for us.

561
01:06:06,603 --> 01:06:08,044
What are we gonna do?

562
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:10,204
I don't know.

563
01:06:12,483 --> 01:06:14,403
I can see their shotgun.

564
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:17,164
I'm gonna go for it.

565
01:06:18,364 --> 01:06:20,244
While they're still working,
I'm gonna go for it.

566
01:06:22,924 --> 01:06:25,324
Even if you get it,
you don't know how to use it.

567
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:27,403
We don't have a choice!

568
01:06:28,244 --> 01:06:30,644
When they'll find out that he's not there,

569
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:34,523
they will find us and
they will kill us.

570
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:41,564
I gotta try.

571
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:48,764
Wait!

572
01:07:02,763 --> 01:07:04,203
I'm sorry.

573
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:06,083
For everything.

574
01:07:08,244 --> 01:07:11,124
I only did this because I thought
it would help us.

575
01:07:14,443 --> 01:07:15,883
I love you.

576
01:08:04,404 --> 01:08:05,843
Where am I?

577
01:08:07,643 --> 01:08:08,604
Please.

578
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:17,484
Please.

579
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:32,084
Stop, just stop it, stop!

580
01:08:44,043 --> 01:08:45,684
Who are you?

581
01:08:45,844 --> 01:08:48,924
If you say one more word
they're gonna kill us all.

582
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:34,444
Fuck!

583
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:38,924
Come on!

584
01:09:45,763 --> 01:09:47,683
Piece of shit is stuck!

585
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:26,603
I don't hear anything.

586
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,283
He's there!

587
01:10:29,924 --> 01:10:31,843
One of two possible scenarios.

588
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:34,684
That voice...

589
01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:39,883
I know that voice.

590
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:52,403
It's empty.

591
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:54,443
That was the other one.

592
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:03,203
That's the man who brought me here.

593
01:11:04,563 --> 01:11:06,004
They're still in the house.

594
01:11:06,124 --> 01:11:07,363
All three of them.

595
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:13,843
Don't move!

596
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:23,723
Cops?

597
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:32,803
Your neck.

598
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:42,484
My weapon.

599
01:11:43,524 --> 01:11:44,203
What for?

600
01:11:44,324 --> 01:11:45,763
To cover your ass.

601
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:15,844
<i>Sorry to bother you, sir. </i>

602
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:19,043
Oh, it's no problem. What's up?
What's going on?

603
01:12:19,803 --> 01:12:23,604
Well, someone discharged a flare
about an hour ago in this neighborhood.

604
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,323
A flare? Really, wow.

605
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:29,564
Could you open the door, please?

606
01:12:30,404 --> 01:12:32,325
Yeah, yeah. One second.

607
01:12:42,044 --> 01:12:43,004
You know, I...

608
01:12:43,844 --> 01:12:45,764
I didn't see or hear anything.

609
01:12:45,884 --> 01:12:50,484
I crashed on the couch, hours ago.
I've been out like a rock.

610
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:54,024
- Sorry to bother you again, sir.
- Ah, no problem.

611
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:57,324
You know what, it's probably some of these
neighborhood kids trying to have a laugh.

612
01:12:57,924 --> 01:12:58,849
Look out!

613
01:12:58,884 --> 01:13:00,043
- Drop your weapon!
- This is my home.

614
01:13:00,124 --> 01:13:02,044
- Put it down, sir!
- This is my home.

615
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:04,323
They broke in, okay?
They're trying to kill us!

616
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:05,764
I don't give a damn!
Put your weapon down!

617
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,083
You don't understand!

618
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:08,648
- I do understand!
- No, you don't!

619
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,363
They've been after me and my wife all night.
They're trying to kill us!

620
01:13:11,404 --> 01:13:13,604
- Please, don't make me do this!
- Godammit, listen to me!

621
01:13:15,164 --> 01:13:16,804
I will shoot you where you stand!

622
01:13:17,243 --> 01:13:18,204
Put the weapon down, drop it!

623
01:13:19,324 --> 01:13:19,963
No!

624
01:13:38,004 --> 01:13:39,923
That was for the flare gun.

625
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:44,804
I'm gonna take it easy on you, David.

626
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:47,724
But I can't say the same thing
about your little wife.

627
01:13:49,484 --> 01:13:51,884
I've got some real payback waiting
for that bitch.

628
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:12,964
Oh, man!

629
01:14:14,004 --> 01:14:15,443
What a night!

630
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:22,644
<i>Hello?</i>

631
01:14:23,323 --> 01:14:24,763
Whose car is that, outside?

632
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:27,844
- Trish!
- Michelangelo broke up with me

633
01:14:27,883 --> 01:14:29,843
and I went to you guys apartment

634
01:14:30,003 --> 01:14:32,884
and noone was there...
I need to talk to Amy.

635
01:14:32,924 --> 01:14:34,764
Get out of here!

636
01:14:36,403 --> 01:14:37,363
Oh my god!

637
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:42,443
No! Get out of here!

638
01:14:43,443 --> 01:14:44,124
No!

639
01:14:59,803 --> 01:15:00,844
Come on, man!

640
01:15:07,364 --> 01:15:09,764
Why?

641
01:15:12,564 --> 01:15:13,524
On your feet.

642
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:16,364
Back to business.

643
01:15:28,164 --> 01:15:29,324
Better work on that poker face.

644
01:15:29,684 --> 01:15:30,644
Let's go!

645
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:33,763
We have 15 minutes before police show up,
looking for officer Friendly.

646
01:15:57,124 --> 01:15:58,364
The keypad.

647
01:15:58,403 --> 01:15:59,643
Where is it?

648
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:16,963
Give me your thumb!

649
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:18,043
Fuck you!

650
01:17:19,443 --> 01:17:20,084
Hey!

651
01:17:55,123 --> 01:17:56,444
Come on!

652
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,843
The front door! The front door, this way.

653
01:18:06,403 --> 01:18:07,363
No! Stop!

654
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:01,164
I don't know how to disarm this.

655
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:10,364
The back door.

656
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,004
<i>Emergency, what's the problem?</i>

657
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:21,324
Cops are on their way.

658
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:24,483
Fuck, shit!

659
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,523
There's no way out.

660
01:19:38,163 --> 01:19:39,123
Over here!

661
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:51,163
We need something
to pry this open with.

662
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:11,203
Come on!

663
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:29,644
- Fuck this!
- No, wait.

664
01:20:34,244 --> 01:20:35,204
Come on, come on!

665
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:41,324
Come on!

666
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:01,284
Ah, the cops are here.

667
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:04,484
You can take us hostage to scare them.

668
01:21:05,204 --> 01:21:07,404
I'll have to put in on this.

669
01:21:07,523 --> 01:21:09,444
Hostage scenario is out the window.

670
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:12,044
So, we're gonna have to improvise.

671
01:21:15,483 --> 01:21:16,763
Adapt.

672
01:21:30,884 --> 01:21:33,284
I'm the good guy,
you're the bad guy.

673
01:21:33,563 --> 01:21:36,724
If the catch me before I drive out of here,
Amy dies.

674
01:21:37,044 --> 01:21:40,123
If they catch you alive,
Amy dies.

675
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,083
Got it?

676
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,564
Don't let them find you here.

677
01:22:01,123 --> 01:22:03,324
Put your arms around me
and don't let go.

678
01:22:07,084 --> 01:22:10,363
If you make a move or
get me cornered

679
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:12,964
I will kill you.

680
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:23,963
Two intruders.

681
01:22:24,244 --> 01:22:26,644
They came for the drugs,
heroin I think.

682
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:28,963
And when did the second intruder go?

683
01:22:29,004 --> 01:22:32,044
He escaped, two minutes
before you got here.

684
01:22:34,804 --> 01:22:38,644
Jesus... we're lucky to be alive.

685
01:22:51,644 --> 01:22:53,564
I can't believe they killed her.

686
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:58,884
I'm sorry, honey.

687
01:23:02,163 --> 01:23:03,603
You know the victim, ma'am?

688
01:23:11,564 --> 01:23:12,524
Ma'am?

689
01:23:14,084 --> 01:23:16,003
She was my friend.

690
01:23:33,363 --> 01:23:34,804
And you are, sir?

691
01:23:36,844 --> 01:23:38,244
I'm her father.

692
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:06,923
Don't say a word!

693
01:24:07,124 --> 01:24:10,003
And what else can you tell us about
the second intruder, mr. Cobb?

694
01:24:11,483 --> 01:24:12,724
He was...

695
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:15,924
He was about 5'11", 180...

696
01:24:16,043 --> 01:24:17,283
Listen to me.

697
01:24:17,723 --> 01:24:20,804
The guy in the other room,
he's got my wife.

698
01:24:21,443 --> 01:24:24,323
If you call for help,
he's gonna kill her.

699
01:24:24,764 --> 01:24:25,844
Okay?

700
01:24:27,124 --> 01:24:29,044
I need you to believe me.

701
01:24:29,084 --> 01:24:31,284
Alright, just... just calm down.

702
01:24:32,164 --> 01:24:36,003
- Put the gun down.
- Sorry!

703
01:24:43,564 --> 01:24:45,484
Man down!
Man down!

704
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:54,043
Dark hair, short, above ears.

705
01:24:54,243 --> 01:24:56,164
<i>Sir, you're gonna be alright. </i>

706
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,604
Look, detective...

707
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,747
I'm not spending another second
in this house.

708
01:25:17,923 --> 01:25:19,643
My daughter and I've been
through enough already.

709
01:25:20,004 --> 01:25:21,923
I understand. Why don't you step
right this way.

710
01:25:32,163 --> 01:25:35,364
You'll be under police protection
for the next 48 hours.

711
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,603
That won't be necessary.

712
01:25:37,964 --> 01:25:39,883
Sorry, sir... but that's
standard procedure.

713
01:25:44,403 --> 01:25:45,844
Police! Stop!

714
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:54,924
It's right over here.
It's not too much...

715
01:25:55,244 --> 01:25:57,163
Yeah! Right here...

716
01:25:59,563 --> 01:26:02,523
What did you say your name
was again, sir?

717
01:26:03,203 --> 01:26:04,163
Louis.

718
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,523
Louis Cobb.

719
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:09,003
Cobb, that's right!

720
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:10,644
Two B's.

721
01:26:24,724 --> 01:26:27,883
Stop, right now!
Dammit!

722
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,142
<i>We need an exit... he's getting away.
Turn around!</i>

723
01:26:46,443 --> 01:26:48,163
You in real estate, sir?

724
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:53,604
- Mr. Cobb.
- Excuse me?

725
01:26:53,844 --> 01:26:56,724
Are you in real estate, mr. Cobb?

726
01:26:57,684 --> 01:26:58,964
Yeah.

727
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:09,724
Do you mind if I talk to your daughter
in private for just one moment?

728
01:27:09,763 --> 01:27:11,684
Just one second. Please.

729
01:27:18,404 --> 01:27:19,363
Sure.

730
01:27:22,923 --> 01:27:24,364
Calm down, baby!

731
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:26,363
Shoot him!

732
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:28,884
You sit, shut up!

733
01:27:29,284 --> 01:27:30,244
Stand, sir!

734
01:27:43,483 --> 01:27:44,404
Drop it!

735
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:51,763
I thought you weren't gonna
open that, David.

736
01:27:52,443 --> 01:27:54,364
There's a lot of people
looking for you.

737
01:27:55,044 --> 01:27:56,963
And you just killed a cop.

738
01:27:58,043 --> 01:28:01,204
Take your shot at me and
they're gonna put you down.

739
01:28:02,163 --> 01:28:04,283
And you're gonna ask yourself...

740
01:28:04,964 --> 01:28:07,843
Is killing me worth killing yourself?

741
01:28:08,124 --> 01:28:10,043
David, put the gun down.

742
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:13,364
He's got a weapon!

743
01:28:14,283 --> 01:28:15,524
Drop the gun!

744
01:28:15,883 --> 01:28:18,124
Is my life really worth yours, David?

745
01:28:19,323 --> 01:28:20,083
No.

746
01:28:20,123 --> 01:28:22,524
- Drop the gun!
- Let me see your hands!

747
01:28:25,005 --> 01:28:27,884
Do it now! Do it now!

748
01:28:29,364 --> 01:28:30,804
Everybody says...

749
01:28:32,204 --> 01:28:33,643
No!

750
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,083
Next time, you pick the house.

751
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:43,884
Amy!

752
01:28:43,964 --> 01:28:44,924
No!

753
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:49,884
Amy!

754
01:28:54,724 --> 01:28:55,683
No!

755
01:30:01,484 --> 01:30:02,443
He's got a gun!

756
01:30:03,243 --> 01:30:04,204
Drop the gun!

757
01:30:43,684 --> 01:30:45,604
Wait, wait!
That's my husband.

758
01:30:48,483 --> 01:30:51,363
What did they do to you?
You okay?

759
01:30:51,763 --> 01:30:53,003
I'm fine, baby.

760
01:30:53,803 --> 01:30:54,764
As long as you're alright.

761
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:55,844
Okay.

762
01:30:57,763 --> 01:30:59,283
What happened to him?

763
01:30:59,964 --> 01:31:01,123
He's gone.

764
01:31:01,844 --> 01:31:02,803
He's gone.

765
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:05,244
What did he say to you?

766
01:31:06,684 --> 01:31:07,643
He said...

767
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:11,283
Next time I should pick the house.

768
01:31:12,963 --> 01:31:14,124
I agree.
