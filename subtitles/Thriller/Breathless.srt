00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:16,684
All right, all bets are down.
No more bets, please.

3
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:33,566
# I'm just a bad boy

4
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:42,441
# All dressed up in fancy clothes

5
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:45,531
# I ain't takin' no trouble

6
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,605
# To blow my bubbles away

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,692
Breathless (1983)

8
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:56,681
- Hey.
- Hi!

9
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:00,367
Tail those two guys.
I'm takin' a ride in their car.

10
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:05,967
"In all the galaxies,
in all the endless reaches of space,

11
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:09,250
I have found no planet
more blessed than this one."

12
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,130
"And yet, in its uncontrollable insanity,

13
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:16,125
the human race seeks to destroy
this shining jewel,

14
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:21,332
this blessed sphere,
which men call Earth."

15
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:24,563
"And trapped upon this world of madness

16
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,927
stand I!"

17
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:29,003
"The Silver Surfer!"

18
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:35,042
Yeah! Yeah, you tell 'em, Surfman!
You tell 'em!

19
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:40,085
# Life is just a bowl of cherries

20
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,970
# I ain't taking no trouble

21
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:47,921
# To turn my nights into day

22
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:50,003
Hello, little Porsche!

23
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,010
Like to go home with me, little Porsche?

24
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,649
Take me all the way to LA
to see my baby!

25
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:08,044
# I can see all the folks,
they're laughin' at me

26
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:13,532
# Cos I'm just naturally crazy

27
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:16,007
# Bad boy

28
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:25,005
# All dressed up in fancy clothes

29
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,488
Jesse! Jesse!

30
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:35,405
- Jess, take me with you!
- Nah! Risky, baby.

31
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:39,245
Jess, I ain't scared of nothin'!

32
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:00,925
Come on, you little baby Porsche!
Come on! Come on!

33
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:08,402
Yeah, that's right! Yeah!

34
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,960
All right.

35
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,410
So first I go get the money.
Then I go ask Monica.

36
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:18,087
I say "Monica,
you ever been to Mexico, honey?"

37
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:26,009
I say "Monica, darlin',
you coming to Mexico with me?"

38
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,610
"Monica, you coming to Mexico with me!"

39
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,250
Me and Monica!

40
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,368
# Cos I'm gonna
tell you how it's gonna be!

41
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,727
# Mon-Monica and me!

42
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:41,201
Me and Monica!
Yeah, me and Monica go to Méjico!

43
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,604
Look at that sky!
We got some music here?

44
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,563
Ain't you pretty?

45
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,323
Disco.

46
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:03,003
Manilow.

47
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:08,683
I know what we need!
We need the Killer! The Killer rocks on!

48
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:12,961
Mr Jerry Lee Lewis
and his pumpin' piano!

49
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:27,491
# If you're gonna love me,
lover, please don't tease

50
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,006
# If I can hold you, honey, let me squeeze

51
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,811
# Well, my heart, it goes round and round

52
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,962
# And my love comes tumblin' down

53
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:40,843
# You leave me... ah... breathless!

54
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:45,648
# Oh, I shake all over,
honey, you know why

55
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:49,008
# I'm sure it's love,
baby, now that ain't no lie

56
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:53,401
Let me have a look here
and see who's lost a Porsche.

57
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:56,530
Wow! Holy frijoles!

58
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,490
# Breathless!

59
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,009
# Ooh, baby!

60
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,488
# Mmm, crazy!

61
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,126
# Honey, you're much too much

62
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,168
# Now you know I can't love you enough

63
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:11,447
# It's all right to hold me tight

64
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:16,931
# But when you love me, love me right!

65
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,886
# Come on, baby, now you don't be shy

66
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,566
# This love was meant for just you and I

67
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:26,247
# Wind, rain, sleet or snow,
I'm gonna get you, baby

68
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,448
My God! Look at that sky!

69
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:33,802
# You leave me... ah... breathless!

70
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:41,562
Come on, girl! Damn!

71
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:45,244
Grandma was slow, but she was old!

72
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:51,441
Hey, girls! You ever kiss a pig?

73
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:06,324
I say "Monica! I'm comin', baby!
I'm getting closer!"

74
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:12,570
# Baby... baby

75
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,643
# Honey, you're much too much

76
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,123
Shit! A cop!

77
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,762
Jinxed! I swear to God, I am jinxed!

78
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,650
# Come on, baby, now you don't be shy

79
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,041
# This love was meant for just you and I

80
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,487
# Wind, rain, sleet or snow

81
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,166
# Honey, Jerry's gonna get you
wherever you go

82
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:40,451
# You... leave me... ah...

83
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,690
# Breathless!

84
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,410
Come on!

85
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:56,484
Goddamn! Piece-of-shit Porsche!

86
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,291
Freeze!

87
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:10,331
Move away from the car! Let me see
your hands! Get away from the car!

88
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:14,401
Move! I said move!
Get away from the car, you son of a bitch!

89
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:17,211
Get away from the car
or I'll blow you away!

90
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,963
Jinxed.

91
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,723
That's right. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

92
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,567
Around the corner. Nobody home.

93
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:45,887
Baby, I like yellow.

94
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:53,321
Monica - 19.

95
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,323
Nobody home.

96
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,605
What do you think?

97
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,683
Hey, good idea.

98
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,170
- Hello?
- Who is it?

99
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:10,050
- Roto-Rooter.
- Hello?

100
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,250
- Who is there, please?
- Is the pool man. I forgot my key.

101
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:11,003
Monica!

102
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:20,891
I'm a bear for ya, baby!
I'm sniffin' around your honey tree!

103
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,042
Monica.

104
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,123
You Frenchy!

105
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,683
Who are you, dopey?

106
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:39,603
Schmuck!

107
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,968
Back to Disneyland for you.

108
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:48,329
You're so pretty.

109
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:11,203
# Ah, honey, honey, honey,
hold on real tight

110
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,886
# And if you love me, love me right

111
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:18,762
# And if you love me, love me right!

112
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,730
# Come on, baby, now don't be shy

113
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:26,201
# Cos love was meant for you and I

114
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,049
Cheese!

115
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:38,290
Hey, Tolmatchoff. Shake it up!

116
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:41,045
Not there? Do you know where he is?

117
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:45,367
Yeah. Yeah, it's Jesse.
I just got back into town.

118
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:49,047
He's holdin' some money for me.
Gotta have it right away.

119
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,521
Hey, babe, come on. Talk to me.

120
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,841
Right. Catch him at work.

121
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,723
Where are you?

122
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,121
Monica.

123
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:13,366
# Don't know much about history

124
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:17,404
# Don't know much biology

125
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:21,285
- Who's in there now?
- Monica, the French girl.

126
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:25,684
- They're squashing her now!
- Those guys are like vampires!

127
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,763
They're flunking everybody!

128
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,246
# And I know that if you love me, too

129
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:35,166
# What a wonderful world this would be

130
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:38,446
# Don't know much about geography

131
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:42,250
# Don't know much trigonometry

132
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,651
# Don't know much about algebra

133
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:49,291
# Don't know what a slide rule is for

134
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,965
# But I do know one and one is two

135
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:56,286
# And if this one could be with you

136
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,887
Let me help you with that.

137
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:02,327
- Sorry.
- That's OK. You're doing great.

138
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,880
Just keep it cute.

139
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,282
Go on, please.

140
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,802
# I can win your love for me

141
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:17,929
# Don't know much about history

142
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:23,647
There's a review in progress.
You can't go in there now.

143
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,802
Hold that for me.

144
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:30,202
- Hello, sunshine!
- There's an exam going on in here!

145
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,767
Who is this guy? Do you know him?

146
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,762
Fear not. The Silver Surfer
serves those in distress.

147
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,366
- Is this a friend of yours, Monica?
- Oh, no, no. She don't know me.

148
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:47,808
I'm here from Maintenance.
They sent me to pick up this table.

149
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,364
Are you crazy?
There's an exam going on in here!

150
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:58,523
- Go ahead. Ask me a question.
- About how long you gonna be, pal?

151
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,727
I gotta get this
down to art class real quick.

152
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:05,646
They need something to put
a banana on, so they can draw it.

153
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:09,168
You can't just draw a banana
when it's lying on the floor.

154
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,244
- Now, just a minute!
- What's going on here?

155
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,971
That's a terrible stain.

156
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:18,089
Somebody ought to call Security
on that young man!

157
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:22,006
Hey, look at this. Hey, wild man!

158
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:28,289
The kid's a good sport. Give her an A.

159
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:32,567
- Can you go on, Monica?
- You sure you're OK?

160
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:51,485
# Don't know much about history

161
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:55,051
# Don't know much biology

162
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,525
# Don't know much about a science book

163
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:02,289
# Don't know much
about the French I took

164
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:05,530
# But I do know that I love you

165
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:09,131
# And I know that if you love me, too

166
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:12,488
# What a wonderful world this would be

167
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,041
Hello, kid!

168
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,967
Do you want to go to Méjico with me?

169
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,850
Did you do this because I left
in the middle of the night?

170
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:31,323
Did I hurt your feelings
because I didn't say goodbye?

171
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:35,561
You could have cost me my degree!

172
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:45,003
All right, all right, all right, all right!
I know I'm crazy. I can't help it.

173
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:47,162
I guess I love you.

174
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:51,370
Love? We spent one or two nights
together in Las Vegas, that's all.

175
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:55,161
- Four. Come on. Let's go to Mexico!
- Don't be ridiculous!

176
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:58,403
- I have to study.
- All right. Bring your books along.

177
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,052
We'll feed 'em to the big turtles!

178
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,123
But I can't, Jesse.

179
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,211
I have to stay in school or my family
won't send me any more money.

180
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:14,210
Need money? That's what I'm doin' here.
I'm pickin' up a big bag of money!

181
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,806
But you told me
you had lots of enemies in LA.

182
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,089
Yeah, I do, I do! My enemies and you.

183
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:24,329
- So you're in danger.
- Yeah, I'm a desperado.

184
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:26,801
Desperado? What does it mean?

185
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:30,123
It means I'm desperate for you, Monica!

186
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:36,924
It's like blasting along the highway,
going 90, maybe 100 miles an hour.

187
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,004
Suddenly there's a dip in the road,
to suck your guts out!

188
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:42,287
Your breath is gone!

189
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:46,290
That's me around you, sugar! That's me!

190
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,283
Breathless!

191
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,803
You scare me, Jesse.

192
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:02,086
You can't just burst into a person's life
and explode it all up like this.

193
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:07,527
Las Vegas was a holiday. This is my life!

194
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:10,604
- Come here!
- Oh, no! Go away, Jesse!

195
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:20,927
You're wrong, you know! Las Vegas
was real life. This here's a holiday.

196
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,167
Then go back to Las Vegas!

197
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:40,641
A highway patrolman is on the critical list
at Mercy Hospital, Barstow,

198
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,371
after a shoot-out in the Mojave Desert.

199
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:47,240
He was found early this morning near
a car stolen in Las Vegas yesterday.

200
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,244
The assailant is believed
to be heading for Los Angeles.

201
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:54,120
A jacket with a wad of money
but no billfold was left at the scene.

202
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:57,409
- Here we go.

203
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,962
This is where you wanted
to get out, isn't it?

204
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,612
- Here?
- Oh, yeah. Right. Thanks.

205
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,323
- Thanks a lot.
- OK.

206
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:19,048
Hello, little honey! Tolmatchoff around?

207
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,083
Thank you.

208
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,963
Hey, kemo sabe!

209
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:30,281
How ya doin'? Hello, kid.

210
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,009
Hey, sheik.

211
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:38,088
- Got my money?
- He dropped it off yesterday. Back here.

212
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:42,125
So what's happening
at the kasbah this week?

213
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:45,170
- I don't know. How's Vegas?
- Great! I met a little girl.

214
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:48,881
- We're going to Mexico together.
- So you're on the lam again.

215
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,561
Here you go. Payday.

216
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:58,208
Said to tell you it was a slick job.
He's ready to go again any time you want.

217
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:00,567
Wait a minute. What is this? Cheque?

218
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:03,644
This fuckhead,
he couldn't send me some cash?

219
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,121
I don't know, man. I'm just
an innocent bystander. You know that.

220
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:12,808
- What am I gonna do with a cheque?
- Those guys play it strictly legit.

221
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:16,931
- Can you cash it for me?
- Not today. All my breadski's tied up.

222
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,765
- What about Berrutti?
- Saw him yesterday in Venice.

223
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,003
He is rolling in cash. Give him a call.

224
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:28,165
- Tolmatchoff, got the charts?
- Just a second, boss.

225
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,449
So, tell me. Who is this lovely
young thing you came to see?

226
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:34,205
French girl. Schoolgirl. Great girl.

227
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,527
Kills me!

228
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:40,001
Yeah. Is Berrutti there?

229
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,601
What time's he gonna be back?

230
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:49,449
Well, look, tell him... Tell him that...

231
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:52,649
Tell him Jesse's looking for him.
I'll call back later.

232
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:53,721
Bye.

233
00:19:57,372 --> 00:20:01,570
There's something else about her,
you know. Something in her eyes.

234
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:03,927
French, you know?

235
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:07,243
- God! You're such a fuck-up!
- Yeah, I know.

236
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,962
Adiós, amigo.

237
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:39,405
Tolmatchoff!
I told you I smelled something!

238
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:42,006
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Enright and me were reminiscing.

239
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:45,164
Remember when you turned in
your buddy Johnny Goddard?

240
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:48,005
- You guys needed some help.
- It's gonna happen again.

241
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:52,449
Jesse Lujack? Also known as Jesse
Lee Burns. Also known as Jack Burns.

242
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:56,445
Five ten, 160 pounds. Age 28.
Medium-length brown hair.

243
00:20:56,532 --> 00:21:00,810
This dump is his last known
place of work. Street punk.

244
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:05,488
So what? I know him. He worked here.
Made some deliveries a few years ago.

245
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:08,370
- So has he been around here lately?
- No.

246
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:11,524
Lieutenant, this person you're looking for.

247
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,968
- Is he kind of a seedy Vegas boy?
- Yeah, maybe.

248
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:18,840
Thinks he's cute.
Somebody like that just left.

249
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,923
Bingo!

250
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:24,561
Accessory to murder!
You know what that means!

251
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:19,211
Hey, kid. Take those home
and put 'em on your boots.

252
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,283
Hey, wow! Thanks!

253
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:26,686
Anaheim, San Diego,
Tijuana, points south!

254
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,970
Didn't you have
a different car in Las Vegas?

255
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:37,887
Yeah. That one's in the shop getting fixed.
This one's just a loaner.

256
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:45,842
Good wind, huh?

257
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,682
It's so hot. You like it?

258
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:52,166
Yeah. The hotter the better.

259
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:57,042
Gotta love those Santa Anas, honey!
Just stokin' up the fires!

260
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,682
Where you goin'?

261
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:05,967
Downtown. Bonaventure Hotel.

262
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,005
Come on, get in. I know a short cut.

263
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,162
Come on.

264
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,963
Come on.

265
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:28,642
# Open up, honey,
it's your lover-boy me that's a-knockin'

266
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:33,929
# Why don't you listen to me, sugar?
All the cats are at the high school rockin'

267
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,767
# Time to get your boppin' shoes

268
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:41,091
- You know who that is, don't you?
- Yeah. You told me in Vegas.

269
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,766
Another crazy man. Lee Lewis?

270
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,930
Another crazy man? Another crazy man?

271
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,881
No! This is the one, the only,
the original, the true Jerry Lee Lewis!

272
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:54,327
Listen to this guy! He means it!

273
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:59,044
Can't stop, won't stop, never stop! Wow!

274
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:02,649
Jerry Lee - he's burnin'! B-B-Burnin'!

275
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:12,888
- What's so funny, honey?
- You! Those clothes!

276
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:16,450
You don't like 'em? I'll take 'em off!

277
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,807
No! Stop!

278
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:22,121
What happened to the blue suit
you had in Vegas?

279
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:25,010
- Blue suit?
- Yeah. Your lucky suit.

280
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:27,687
It wasn't the suit that was lucky.
It was you.

281
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,050
When you walked out,
I started rolling fool's dice.

282
00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:36,730
Fool's dice. Snake eyes.

283
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,803
Double zero.

284
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,923
You roll dice too much.

285
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:44,643
You think that, huh?

286
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:56,088
You think maybe I was rollin' dice
when I should have been rollin' you?

287
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,802
# Rockin' at the high school hop

288
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:01,601
# Because they're jumpin'
at the high school hop

289
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:03,683
# We're rollin' at the high school hop

290
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:08,080
- I gotta make a stop.
- But my appointment!

291
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:11,084
It's all right. It'll just take a minute.

292
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:19,450
What is this place?

293
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:24,365
Friend of mine,
a guy who owes me some money.

294
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:26,841
He's got kind of an office here.

295
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:32,442
I like it. It's very sinistre.

296
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,328
Sinister! Spooky!

297
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:39,882
Can we get something to eat?

298
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,763
Sit down.

299
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:48,843
Order anything you want, all right?
Arcadia! "Servicio, por favor!

300
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:52,326
I'll be back sooner than trouble.

301
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:04,285
I don't care if your mother got syphilis.
I want my money.

302
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:06,363
Carlito.

303
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,407
I'll call you back.

304
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:14,002
"Tu estas loco, qué tu haces aqui!
What are you doin' here? Are you crazy?

305
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:17,482
I was out in Pasadena all day
looking for Berrutti.

306
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:25,002
The man's been around looking for you!
Twice they've been around!

307
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:26,889
- For me?
- Yeah! For you!

308
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,169
- What for?
- Cos you shot a cop. What do you think?

309
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:34,201
This is serious business! You think
you're Jesse James? A pistolero?

310
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,522
"Come and get me, copper!"

311
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:38,887
No, man. It wasn't like that.

312
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:43,684
Shit! I gotta find Berrutti!

313
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:57,243
- Can you cash a cheque?
- Cheque?

314
00:28:57,332 --> 00:29:00,130
Forget it. Loan me 10. Give me 10.

315
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:03,170
Are you crazy? I ain't got no $10!
I got a buck 80 to my name!

316
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:07,245
I'll give you a bus pass, man.
Good for the whole month.

317
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,882
You with Jesse? Let me introduce myself.

318
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,691
Hey! Hey, give me back that purse!

319
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:30,767
There's nothing in there for you!
Give me that purse! Give me it!

320
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:35,765
Give me that purse, junkie! Help!

321
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:38,685
Shit! Shit! Agh! Shit!

322
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:42,890
That's my sapphire!
Hey, there's nothing in there!

323
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:46,760
There's nothing
in that purse for you, junkie!

324
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,884
- Come on. You don't wanna be late.
- What?

325
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,761
- Come on.
- Wait! My taco!

326
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:12,968
- Don't wanna miss your appointment.
- Can we go fast again?

327
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:35,843
What is it?

328
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:40,160
Jesse, it's so cute!

329
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,369
That's my heart. Don't break it.

330
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:57,445
- I'm staying with you tonight.
- Not tonight. I can't.

331
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:01,127
I just wanna sleep with you.
Be nice to wake up together, wouldn't it?

332
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,203
I told you. I can't, Jesse.

333
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:09,242
I want to know who this joker is
you got this appointment with.

334
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:12,005
He's a professor of mine. It's business.

335
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:16,085
- He's helping me get a job.
- Yeah. Gonna sleep with him?

336
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:19,047
You Americans, you only think about sex.

337
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:20,326
Sex?

338
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,721
I'm in love with you!

339
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:25,201
You love me, too. You'll see.

340
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,883
Stop! It's over there.

341
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:35,445
- I'm gonna park. I wanna meet this jerk.
- No! Let me out!

342
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,442
Get outta here! Go on! Beat it!

343
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:48,208
Get away from me! Get lost! Get outta
here! I don't wanna see you any more!

344
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:09,127
- Monica!
- Oh, hello, Paul.

345
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,083
Hey, great timing!

346
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,446
What a dump!

347
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:24,127
You know Frank Lloyd Wright?
This is Frank Lloyd Wrong!

348
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:29,160
Sorry you had to take the bus.
I had to chauffeur the famous little guy!

349
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:33,962
- Is he here? The great Dr Boudreaux?
- Yeah. I told him all about you.

350
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,009
You look terrific!

351
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,760
Really alive!
You really oughta see yourself!

352
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:45,491
- The wind - it's exciting.
- The wind?

353
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,726
The wind often is exciting.

354
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:56,044
It's so windy, the wind.

355
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:59,287
Tonight you're gonna meet Dr Boudreaux.

356
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:02,205
I want you to charm the guy.
I know that you can.

357
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:09,564
- Monica?
- What did you tell him about me?

358
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:13,604
I told him that you were dazzling

359
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:18,163
and you had this idea how to make
houses out of waterfalls and...

360
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,965
What's the matter? Monica, are you OK?

361
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:24,646
Yes, of course. Why?

362
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,690
I don't know. You seem a little distracted.

363
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,926
No. I was thinking.

364
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,884
Dr Boudreaux - I'd love to work for him.

365
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,803
Now, show me which one he is.

366
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,601
He's the little one that looks so brilliant.
We'll find him.

367
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:48,324
Yeah, I know. They went to see
Carlito, too. What did you tell 'em?

368
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:52,321
Appreciate it.
I can't leave town till I cash this cheque.

369
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:57,406
What about Louis Minor or that frizzy,
ditsy blonde he always hangs with?

370
00:33:57,492 --> 00:34:01,087
Shit! Yeah, I'm already looking for
Berrutti. Thanks, Marty.

371
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,923
Thank you, sir.

372
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:55,491
"..to serve Galactus
and shall do so for evermore."

373
00:34:57,052 --> 00:35:01,364
"If such be my destiny,
willingly do I accept it."

374
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:05,922
- "My fate."
- Man, you like The Silver Surfer?

375
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:10,327
Yeah, I like the Surfman.

376
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:13,123
I think he's a jerk.

377
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:17,091
No! No, man, he's a hero! He's trying
to save the world from Galactus.

378
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,925
- What's wrong with that?
- He's crazy!

379
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:24,369
He could get away any time he wants.
He's got the power cosmic.

380
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:27,649
You know why he stays?
He stays cos he likes it here on Earth.

381
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:31,122
- He wants to help the people out.
- They don't want his help.

382
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:36,161
They're always after him.
The cops and the marines. He's a jerk.

383
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,203
Hey, why don't you go lie down
in the road for a spell?

384
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:44,083
The Surfman's a jerk!

385
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:51,007
"Love is the power supreme."

386
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:54,084
Hey, you gonna buy that book?
This ain't no library.

387
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:10,370
The Surfer's nuts to hang around!
He knows life on Earth has no meaning!

388
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:14,331
It's chaos! It's out of control!
He's got a chance to break away!

389
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:18,928
I mean, he's plugged into the galaxy!
He's got the power cosmic!

390
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:23,450
Only a jerk would stay when he could go.

391
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,641
Yeah, maybe you're right.

392
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,681
The Silver Surfer sucks!

393
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:15,600
Buenos dias, senorita.

394
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:18,010
Oh, no!

395
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:21,722
What are you doing here?

396
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:25,122
Well, the Beverly Wilshire
was booked up so I came here.

397
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:27,931
- There are plenty of other hotels.
- Not for me.

398
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:31,004
I always stay at the Beverly Wilshire.

399
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:34,364
You're really crazy.

400
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,684
Come here. Come on. Hey, hey, hey!
You don't even say hello to me?

401
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:41,844
Why can't I ever be alone
when I wanna be alone?

402
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:52,807
Monica, did you fuck
your teacher last night?

403
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:57,003
Did ya?

404
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:01,885
- Come on. Tell me.
- Leave me alone! I'm thinking!

405
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,324
Monica, you didn't come home last night.

406
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:14,322
It is last night and I am home.
My home, not yours!

407
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:48,361
Why are you looking at me?

408
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,083
Just lookin'.

409
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:34,367
Why are you so afraid
to sleep with me again?

410
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:38,843
Because you scare me.
I don't know what you want from me.

411
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:43,170
- Everything.
- That's too much.

412
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,481
What do you want from me?

413
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:52,401
I don't know.

414
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,484
- Something.
- That's not enough.

415
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:01,690
All or nothing with me, baby!

416
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:05,924
God, I love it when you look afraid
and surprised at the same time!

417
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:08,480
I just wanna climb inside of you!

418
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,883
That feels good!

419
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:40,291
Would it feel so good if some other guy
was touching you like this?

420
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:47,443
You're like one of those girls who'll fuck
everybody except the guy who loves her.

421
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:50,410
You're like
one of those rides at Disneyland.

422
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:52,642
Wow! You make me dizzy!

423
00:41:54,132 --> 00:41:57,647
- Show me your tits.
- What? What for?

424
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:00,451
- Taré!
- What?

425
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:05,925
Taré. It means crazy,
disgusting person, jerk.

426
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:09,125
Taré? I'm a taré?

427
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:16,361
Forget it. Show me your toes.
A woman's toes are very important.

428
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:23,645
I'd love to know
what's behind that face of yours.

429
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:30,090
I stare at you and stare at you
and I can't see anything.

430
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:35,169
What do you wanna know?
I'm from Earth. I'm a person. I love you.

431
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:40,766
That's not enough.

432
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,371
- Jesse...
- What?

433
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,772
Say something nice.

434
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:15,242
- Like what?
- I don't know.

435
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:22,041
I don't know either.

436
00:43:23,492 --> 00:43:25,483
All right. How's this?

437
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,325
Your shoes were red, my suit was blue.

438
00:43:28,412 --> 00:43:31,643
You left me in Vegas,
but I'll always love you.

439
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:35,163
That's nice, isn't it?

440
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:51,327
Hello. Strand Auto Parts?

441
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,808
Hello. Mr Birnbaum?

442
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,964
Is he gonna be there this afternoon?

443
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:06,009
Tell him... Tell him I wanna come see him.

444
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:08,323
Jack Burns.

445
00:44:09,092 --> 00:44:13,244
Yeah. I think Mario called.
Called him all about me from Vegas.

446
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:17,120
I'm supposed to bring over
a little foreign job.

447
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:19,203
Jack Burns.

448
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:22,127
Right. This afternoon. Bye.

449
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:24,601
A little foreign job?

450
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:26,887
Not you, a car.

451
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:41,049
- Monica, come out here.
- No!

452
00:44:59,652 --> 00:45:01,882
Is this your driver's licence?

453
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:03,849
What?

454
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:08,050
No, no. That's my brother's.
Mine's in the car.

455
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:12,171
But the name here is Jack Burns.
How can he be your brother?

456
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,970
Yeah, right, right. That...

457
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:19,283
Well, he's not my real brother.

458
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:25,845
You see, cos when... When I was born,
my mother was already divorced.

459
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:34,247
- I doubt it.
- Me, too.

460
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:43,481
You know William Faulkner?

461
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:46,321
Who's he? Somebody you fucked?

462
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:50,369
The most beautiful American writer.

463
00:45:50,452 --> 00:45:52,920
He wrote my favourite line.

464
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:57,320
"Between grief and nothing,
I will take grief."

465
00:45:58,332 --> 00:46:00,323
This guy sounds like a lot of laughs.

466
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:05,611
No! Seriously. Grief or nothing?
What would you choose?

467
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,328
Nothing.

468
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:13,290
Like I told you, baby.
All or nothing with me.

469
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:45,691
If I was William Faulkner,

470
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:48,764
would you let me touch you like this?

471
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:58,043
No.

472
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:04,003
Hello. This is Monica.

473
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:09,485
I'm not here, but if you leave a message
and tell me your name and number,

474
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:12,040
I will call you as soon as I come back.

475
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:16,125
And don't forget to wait for
the beep sound. Thank you.

476
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:27,930
Hello, Monica. Paul. I'm sorry
that Boudreaux ran off last night,

477
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:33,291
but you can meet him this afternoon.
I got you a pass to the groundbreaking.

478
00:47:33,372 --> 00:47:35,966
So, great.

479
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:39,249
I'll tell you.
You make keeping promises very easy.

480
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:43,325
- Fuck you, Charlie!
- No, don't turn it off.

481
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:45,846
It's in Venice on Main and Rose.

482
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:50,528
Right. And you'll meet him. And the old
and the famous and everybody.

483
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:53,285
This afternoon at three. Three o'clock.

484
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:58,129
And one more thing.

485
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:02,125
I enjoyed last night enormously.

486
00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:05,043
Ciao.

487
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:58,042
The suspect has a criminal record
of car thefts and petty crimes

488
00:48:58,132 --> 00:49:00,600
in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and California.

489
00:49:00,692 --> 00:49:03,411
This is believed to be Lujack's
first murder charge.

490
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:07,121
Police have issued
this 1975 photo of Lujack...

491
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:25,527
Oh, my fucking Christ!

492
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:41,202
..medium-length brown hair, age 28,

493
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:44,170
with a small heart-shaped
tattoo on his chest.

494
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:48,643
We'll be keeping you informed
on this story as it develops.

495
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:57,041
# Caught in a trap

496
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:00,443
# I can't get out

497
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,800
# I'm caught in a trap!

498
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:08,646
- # We're caught in a trap...
- # I can't walk out

499
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:11,121
# I'm caught in a trap

500
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:15,362
- # I can't walk out
- # Because I love you too much...

501
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:19,047
# Because I love you too much, baby

502
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:24,402
- # Why can't you see
- # Why can't you see

503
00:50:24,492 --> 00:50:28,087
- # What you're doin' to me
- Jesse?

504
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:33,166
# When you don't believe a word I say

505
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:43,168
# We can't go on together
with suspicious minds

506
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:48,287
# And we can't build our dreams

507
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:52,604
# On suspicious minds

508
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:55,490
- You're crazy!
- So what?

509
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:57,961
It's OK. I like it.

510
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,606
# I can't walk out

511
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:08,291
# Because I love you too much, baby

512
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:13,964
# Caught in a trap

513
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,361
# I can't walk out

514
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:23,563
# Because I love you too much, baby

515
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:25,643
I'm late.

516
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:35,365
Don't take a shower.
I want us to smell like we've been fuckin'.

517
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,888
That one.

518
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:20,165
- What's that?
- The Silver Surfer.

519
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:23,370
Sky-rider of the spaceways.

520
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:26,524
- Who is he?
- Who's he?

521
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:31,087
He's a space-lost freak lookin' for love.

522
00:52:31,172 --> 00:52:32,924
Love?

523
00:52:33,012 --> 00:52:36,687
Yeah. You see, he's got this problem
with his girlfriend.

524
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:40,761
They're trapped on two different galaxies.

525
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:45,644
No kiddin', really.
I'll show you. Come here.

526
00:52:48,212 --> 00:52:51,682
See, he's gotta go away never to return.

527
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:57,802
"Though infinity beckons,
I must leave behind my very heart."

528
00:52:58,532 --> 00:53:03,811
"Never has there been,
never will there be another such as you."

529
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,330
"If leave you must,
then let us depart together!"

530
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,848
"Say no more!
It cannot be! It can never be!"

531
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:18,803
"Where soars the Silver Surfer,
there must he soar alone."

532
00:53:21,692 --> 00:53:23,842
It's sad.

533
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:26,321
Why does he have to soar alone?

534
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:31,330
It's a long story.
He never stops thinking about her.

535
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:34,131
He doesn't forget. Listen to this.

536
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,887
"I have seen the birth of planets
and the death of worlds."

537
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:44,412
"I have seen galaxies crumble
and new suns aborning."

538
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:49,691
"But in every star, in every sun,
I see her face!"

539
00:53:57,052 --> 00:53:59,520
Hey, what are you doin'?

540
00:54:00,372 --> 00:54:02,966
Trying to shut my eyes very tight,

541
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:05,441
so everything goes black.

542
00:54:06,652 --> 00:54:09,644
But it never gets completely black.

543
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:15,930
You know, you said I was afraid.

544
00:54:17,772 --> 00:54:19,763
It's true.

545
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,727
I'm afraid because I'd like you to love me.

546
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:28,600
And then of... I don't know.

547
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:32,086
I wish you wouldn't love me.

548
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:36,324
You don't fit into my plan for my life.

549
00:54:40,732 --> 00:54:45,442
Well, you're just going to have
to change those plans, darlin'.

550
00:54:47,772 --> 00:54:50,161
Anyway, don't worry about it.

551
00:54:52,652 --> 00:54:56,122
I don't love you the way
you think I do, anyway.

552
00:54:56,212 --> 00:54:59,045
How do you love me?

553
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,327
Not the way you think.

554
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:03,801
You don't know what I think.

555
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:05,883
Yes, I do.

556
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:11,087
You don't know
what I'm thinking about now.

557
00:55:11,172 --> 00:55:13,163
Yes, I do.

558
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,606
I might be pregnant, Jesse.

559
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:26,000
- Did you see a doctor?
- Tomorrow.

560
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:40,758
Yeah! Yeah!

561
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:44,487
Yeah! A little muchacho for you and me!

562
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:50,206
Maybe.

563
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:53,204
It's not for sure.

564
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:08,122
..1961 MGB Roadster. Colour pink.

565
00:56:08,209 --> 00:56:11,007
- How long's the car been here?
- We don't know yet.

566
00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:13,080
You don't know? Find out! Ask!

567
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:16,081
There's three freeways nearby.
He could be long gone.

568
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:20,526
Nah, he ain't gone. He's around here
somewhere. I can smell him!

569
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:26,004
- No!
- Yes!

570
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:29,760
- No!
- Yes!

571
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,917
So many cars in your business.

572
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:01,279
Hey, where's my favourite dress?

573
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:04,805
Isn't a woman allowed
to change her mind?

574
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:25,523
I feel so free with you.

575
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:43,639
Come on.
Let's just go, sugar. Let's just go.

576
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:48,997
Please, Jesse.
I can't be late for this meeting.

577
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,279
All right! Come on, baby!
Say it! Talk to me, baby! Say it!

578
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:19,965
Mexico!
Let's go to Mexico and have a baby!

579
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:22,800
We'll see.

580
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:33,647
Try to understand me, Jesse.
I have to think about the future.

581
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:38,208
The future? Yeah. I heard about it.
Never seen it.

582
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:42,807
- Sounds like bullshit to me.
- Stop calling what I wanna do bullshit!

583
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,084
What you do is bullshit, too!

584
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:47,967
Bullshit it is! The future's Mexico!

585
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:50,805
Say it. Méjico.

586
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:54,321
Méjico! Méjico!

587
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:00,523
How long is this
hole-diggin' shindig gonna last?

588
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:02,600
About an hour.

589
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,879
There is a sidewalk café down the way.
Why don't you meet me there?

590
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:09,164
I'll be there, baby.

591
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:11,363
Officer! I saw this man
drop that girl off over there.

592
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:19,520
Morning, ma'am!

593
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:36,200
Hello, Paul.

594
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:44,240
Dr Boudreaux, meet Monica Poiccard.
This is the student I told you about.

595
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,004
It's a great honour, Dr Boudreaux.

596
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:51,082
Sir, she's the best candidate
for a fellowship I've ever seen.

597
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:54,957
- To work with me? Why?
- Everybody says you're a genius.

598
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:57,486
That's true. So?

599
01:00:57,569 --> 01:01:00,402
Well, I want to learn
to make buildings that last.

600
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:03,686
Don't be foolish. Nothing lasts.

601
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:09,720
- Birnbaum?
- Yeah.

602
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:11,961
Jack Burns.

603
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,277
Oh, yes. Mr Burns.

604
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:19,202
Yeah, I left a message for you
this morning. You get it?

605
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:21,280
Yes, Mr Burns.

606
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:23,758
Mario sent me.

607
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:26,560
Yes, Mr Burns!

608
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:30,919
Move over here.
I wanna run it up to the office.

609
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:39,003
- Did anybody call about me?
- Yes, they called, Mr Burns.

610
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:42,606
They said you were gonna bring
a foreign job, not a T-bird.

611
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:45,761
I know, I know.
That one didn't work out for me.

612
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:50,167
- So? Nu?
- So what about this one?

613
01:01:51,689 --> 01:01:55,079
It's a classic. Perfect paint job.

614
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:58,559
One of a kind. Unique. Cream puff. Cherry.

615
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,125
- 1200.
- Deal.

616
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:06,684
You got one problem.

617
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:12,202
I won't be able to give you
the money till next week.

618
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:16,883
You fat fuck!

619
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:20,564
What about you, Mr Jack Burns?

620
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,683
What time is it? Five o'clock yet?

621
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:29,486
- I got ten after five.
- Where's the phone?

622
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:53,767
Wait a minute.
Too many old prunes in this picture!

623
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:56,643
We need some flowers.

624
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:59,448
- Monica, come with us.
- Me?

625
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:03,078
- Great. Looks like you're in.
- OK! That's more like it!

626
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:05,763
- Where?
- Next to the picture.

627
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,919
Oh, this is better. Who is she?

628
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:13,603
- Look this way!
- Smile, honey!

629
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:19,962
Big smile! Here we go! That's nice!

630
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:27,886
- Know this punk?
- No!

631
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:30,085
You were seen with him 20 minutes ago.

632
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:33,684
He had his hand on your ass
and his tongue down your throat!

633
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:36,561
Come on. You wanna talk with me.

634
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:39,721
- Hey, who are you?
- A cop looking for a cop-killer.

635
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:44,360
Stay out of it, junior.
Still wanna tell me you don't know him?

636
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:47,043
No... I mean...

637
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:50,767
- It's Jesse.
- Jesse what? Jesse Lujack?

638
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:53,044
- Where is he now?
- I don't know!

639
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:56,838
You don't know? Listen, listen. Listen!

640
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:59,318
Don't F-U-C-K with the LAPD!

641
01:04:02,249 --> 01:04:05,047
Please! He's just a guy I've seen
four or five times!

642
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:07,882
I met him in Las Vegas.
I don't know anything about him!

643
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,006
Ma'am, after he dropped you off,
where'd he go?

644
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:13,808
I don't know, I tell you!

645
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:16,278
She's lying. Book her!

646
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:22,007
- What's the charge?
- Suspicion.

647
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:24,444
He's going away.

648
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:29,239
Today sometime. San Francisco.
He's going to San Francisco.

649
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:33,607
He knows a man in San Francisco, a man
who owes him money, and Jesse's...

650
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:36,283
- The name. What's the name?
- Lewis.

651
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:43,488
Berrutti's gone? Yeah, of course
I'll meet him. Yeah... Garage, downtown.

652
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:47,727
Yeah. Got it. 8.30.

653
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:08,806
You're wasting your time.
I keep the moolah in the cooler.

654
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:14,007
- Advance me 500.
- No.

655
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:18,400
50.

656
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:20,207
No!

657
01:05:22,929 --> 01:05:24,920
20.

658
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:28,323
Read my lips...

659
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:32,607
Read my lips, fat-ass!
I can sell this car to 50 other guys!

660
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:44,719
- Hey, Pancho, where's the jumper?
- Don't ask me, man. Ask the boss.

661
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,878
OK, Birnbaum. Don't fuck with me!

662
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,164
Why don't you take a walk, punk?

663
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:58,808
- You stole my jumper, scumbag!
- What are you gonna do? Call the cops?

664
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:32,880
OK! I can't breathe!

665
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,086
It's in my shorts, OK? It's in my shorts!

666
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:40,524
The moolah's in the cooler!

667
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:48,886
This is for my taxi, you little taré!

668
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:53,606
Hey, boss, what's goin' on?
Are you all right?

669
01:06:53,689 --> 01:06:58,160
Do I look all right, dickhead?
Get him! Get that fuck!

670
01:07:04,809 --> 01:07:07,607
Over there, you bean-head! That way!

671
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:34,278
Just don't turn around.
No, sweetheart. Don't turn around.

672
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:36,564
There's a cop...

673
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:51,881
- This guy killed a cop?
- I don't know.

674
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:56,842
- No, hey. You can tell me. Did he?
- I don't know.

675
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,684
You're in love with him?

676
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:04,727
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!

677
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:09,405
Oh, Jesus Christ! What do you mean
you don't know? Are you young?

678
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,799
Look, do you know what you're doing?
Let's say he's around here.

679
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:23,486
If he's here, you'll lead the cops to him.
Want every cop in the world here?

680
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:29,528
Wait! This is that crazy man from
the classroom? The lunatic that broke in?

681
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,918
What is this? You're crazy!

682
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:52,088
Monica, do you understand that you
can ruin your life with a guy like this?

683
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,081
It's not like that. You don't know.

684
01:08:55,169 --> 01:08:58,320
- What?
- You don't know me.

685
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:01,684
No, I guess I don't, I guess.

686
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:11,000
Listen, Paul. I wish I had time
to explain, but I have to go.

687
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:13,846
I'm sorry.

688
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:19,400
Monica!

689
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:28,880
Monica, if you ever need
a place to hide out or anything.

690
01:09:50,889 --> 01:09:52,481
What's going on?

691
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:48,680
Monica!

692
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:53,883
Ain't you happy to see me, sugar?

693
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:56,126
You! Police!

694
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:59,565
I see you! I'm talking to you!

695
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:03,039
Don't try to pretend!
Why are you following me?

696
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:07,407
Because you are looking
for a tremendous amount of trouble!

697
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:09,481
I didn't do anything.

698
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:13,323
Your boyfriend just killed a cop
and you know where he is.

699
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:17,243
- So you might as well tell us.
- He's gone to San Francisco!

700
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:19,559
- You gonna get deported?
- That's my girl!

701
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:23,119
- I told you the truth! He's gone!
- Let me tell you the truth!

702
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:27,202
You don't play ball with us,
you're on the next Concorde outta here!

703
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:35,285
We're trying to help you,
but you gotta start helping us.

704
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:38,566
We got a witness who saw you
with Lujack an hour ago.

705
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:43,245
He must be around here somewhere.
When did you last see him?

706
01:11:45,209 --> 01:11:46,528
Jesus!

707
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:49,520
Hey! You!

708
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:55,279
You comin' or not?

709
01:11:58,409 --> 01:12:02,402
Mexico! Mexico! Méjico!

710
01:12:10,849 --> 01:12:13,921
- Hey, man! Watch it!
- Check your oil, man?

711
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:17,399
Get the stuff out of the back window.
I can't see.

712
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:21,164
The cop!
He's running to the telephone box!

713
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:35,441
- What do we do now?
- Now we go get the money.

714
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:39,000
Get rid of this heap.
Get a car that'll take us to the border.

715
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,444
Mexico by sunrise, baby!

716
01:12:42,129 --> 01:12:44,120
By sunrise?

717
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,679
- In Mexico...
- Yeah?

718
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:51,602
- Is it hot?
- Yeah, it's hot!

719
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:53,361
Hot tamale!

720
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:01,561
Can we live in a house of grass,
by the sea?

721
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:06,122
Sounds good. You, me, the muchacho.

722
01:13:07,569 --> 01:13:11,562
Yeah. You, me, the baby.

723
01:13:11,649 --> 01:13:15,437
The grass house, the sea.

724
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:17,565
You got it, darlin'. You got it.

725
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:20,243
And there is nothing else.

726
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,564
Everything else goes away.

727
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:26,888
There ain't nothin' else. That's it.

728
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,483
Love is the power supreme!

729
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,083
That's the whole story, baby!

730
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,924
Damn! Look at her dance!

731
01:13:59,129 --> 01:14:01,120
Hey, Berrutti!

732
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:03,605
Ray, he's cool. He's cool.

733
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:06,724
Maybe I should say "He's hot!"

734
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:10,961
Maybe the word is lucky.
Is that the word, kid? Finally!

735
01:14:11,049 --> 01:14:14,439
The word is jinxed, my friend.
I'm in a jam.

736
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:20,443
Hey, Stretch. Why don't you take
this little lady for a nice dance?

737
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,444
- Come on, little lady.
- Have fun.

738
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:26,168
What do you need, pal?
You need help at the border?

739
01:14:26,249 --> 01:14:30,640
- Clean cheque I gotta cash.
- Jerk gives you a cheque, huh?

740
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:34,119
Well, this'll have to be tomorrow morning.

741
01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:38,282
- No, tonight. Now.
- I don't have enough cash tonight.

742
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:42,119
Where'd you get those pants?
Disguising yourself as an asshole?

743
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:45,519
How many times have I told you
that style counts?

744
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:47,645
I'm gonna give you this jacket.

745
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:52,120
Put you in style. Make you feel
a lot better. Ain't that beautiful?

746
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:59,282
What's that look on your face?

747
01:15:00,089 --> 01:15:02,922
- Love, I guess.
- Oh, what a drag!

748
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,598
Listen, pal, got a place to stay?

749
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:10,564
- Cops, cops. Which way out of here?
- Over there.

750
01:15:15,569 --> 01:15:18,003
Cops, cops, cops.
Do you know The Pines?

751
01:15:18,089 --> 01:15:20,842
- 8.30 in the morning. OK?
- You got it, pal.

752
01:15:20,929 --> 01:15:22,920
Just jump on. Here's all I got.

753
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:29,046
- There's the girl!
- There's Lujack with her!

754
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:31,438
- Hold it! Police!
- Monica!

755
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:34,758
Get 'em! Get 'em!

756
01:15:36,049 --> 01:15:39,246
The elevator!
They're going down in the elevator!

757
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:43,485
I got 'em down here!
Come on, Lujack, we got you!

758
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:48,003
Don't shoot! He's got the girl with him!

759
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:56,522
Run! Run!

760
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,086
# Take care of each other

761
01:16:00,169 --> 01:16:02,524
# When love walks in the room

762
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:05,884
# Everybody stand up

763
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,368
# Oh, it's good, good, good

764
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:12,525
# Like Brigitte Bardot!

765
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:23,844
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Faster, faster! He's right there!

766
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:26,727
- Let me outta here! Come on!
- Shut up! Faster!

767
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:30,606
Look at you -
steering a getaway car! Scared?

768
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:32,880
Yeah.

769
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:35,164
- But you like it, don't you?
- Yeah!

770
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:39,568
Don't stop now! You got them!
Ram him! Ram him!

771
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:52,280
Turn the goddamn wheel!

772
01:17:00,089 --> 01:17:02,080
# Me and you

773
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:05,129
# Every night, every day

774
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,280
# We'll be together

775
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:11,485
# Always this way

776
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:14,724
# Your eyes are blue

777
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:18,327
# Like the heavens above

778
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,999
# Talk to me, darlin'

779
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,527
# With a message of love

780
01:17:47,249 --> 01:17:49,638
The cops! The cops!

781
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:58,125
Police officers! Freeze!

782
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:06,199
# When love walks in the room

783
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:09,404
# Everybody stand up

784
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:12,963
# Oh, it's good, good, good

785
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:37,678
- What do you see?
- Nah.

786
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:41,558
There's nothing down there.

787
01:19:00,089 --> 01:19:03,365
- Do you want onions?
- Sure.

788
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:05,679
- Cost you a nickel more.
- Movie!

789
01:19:05,769 --> 01:19:09,444
- Never mind the onions.
- Hold the onions.

790
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:14,237
What a fool I was to think
we could buck Las Vegas.

791
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:17,129
We just ran into a bad streak, that's all.

792
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:39,164
- Are we safe now?
- I think so.

793
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:41,319
We have to stay here a while.

794
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:49,566
We've still got a tankful of gas anyway.

795
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:53,039
Bart, do you know
what I was talking about?

796
01:19:55,369 --> 01:19:57,963
Now I know
why it's all or nothing with you.

797
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:00,242
Having fun?

798
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:18,603
What a joint. No more hot water.

799
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:21,078
Look at you.

800
01:20:21,169 --> 01:20:23,888
You're a knockout, kid!

801
01:20:25,329 --> 01:20:27,968
Bart, I want things.
A lot of things. Big things.

802
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:30,609
I don't want to be afraid of life
or anything else.

803
01:20:31,049 --> 01:20:33,324
I told you I was no good...

804
01:20:33,409 --> 01:20:36,879
I don't wanna be afraid of life
or anything else.

805
01:20:39,049 --> 01:20:41,847
You don't have to be afraid of nothing.

806
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,799
I'll hock my guns. That'll give us
enough dough to make a new start.

807
01:21:04,889 --> 01:21:08,438
There isn't enough money in those
guns for the kind of start I want.

808
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:10,997
I want a guy with spirit and guts!

809
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:14,320
A guy who can laugh at anything
or do anything.

810
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:18,119
A guy that can kick over the traces
and win the world for me!

811
01:21:18,209 --> 01:21:20,598
I wanna make love to you!

812
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:26,879
Monica, are you crazy?

813
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:30,000
So what?

814
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:34,005
So I like it!

815
01:21:34,569 --> 01:21:39,484
Come on, Bart. Let's finish it
the way we started it - on the level.

816
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,758
Open your eyes.

817
01:22:13,809 --> 01:22:16,198
See anything you like?

818
01:22:18,169 --> 01:22:21,320
- This one?
- The red one?

819
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:23,240
Eldorado!

820
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:42,524
- What is this place?
- This is where Berrutti'll meet us.

821
01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:45,169
Call it The Pines.
You ever hear of Errol Flynn?

822
01:22:45,249 --> 01:22:49,208
Famous crazy fucker and movie star.
This was his spread.

823
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:59,484
- This is where we stay tonight?
- No, up at the top.

824
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:03,926
Right by the pool.
Got the honeymoon suite with a view!

825
01:23:29,929 --> 01:23:32,921
- What does jinx mean?
- What?

826
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:36,399
Your friend back there -
you told him you were jinxed.

827
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:42,404
Jinxed means you got the devil's blessing.

828
01:23:47,009 --> 01:23:49,000
Ever seen the devil?

829
01:23:58,129 --> 01:24:01,121
How much money
will you get from Berrutti?

830
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:04,958
Enough for a while.

831
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:23,084
What will we do in Mexico
when the money is finished?

832
01:24:23,169 --> 01:24:25,967
Get more! Keep goin'!

833
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,078
Money's my middle name, baby!

834
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:33,839
How do we get more?

835
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,960
Become thieves?

836
01:24:37,049 --> 01:24:39,040
I don't know.

837
01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:42,762
What do you keep asking me
these questions for?

838
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:46,888
About the future,
which I don't know, you don't know!

839
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:50,564
Nobody knows it! So fuck it, roll the dice!

840
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:48,560
Jesse?

841
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:53,367
- Jesse?
- What?

842
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,838
I just wanted to say good morning.

843
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:58,720
So far so good.

844
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:16,404
- What are you doing?
- Examining these plugs.

845
01:26:16,489 --> 01:26:20,880
The pimp that owned this thing
must have treated it like a piece of shit!

846
01:26:22,609 --> 01:26:25,407
- Jesse?
- What?

847
01:26:26,209 --> 01:26:28,803
Tell me you love me.

848
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:31,483
Yeah, sure I do, sugar.

849
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:43,400
Damn it!

850
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:49,247
Do me a favour, pumpkin.

851
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:55,197
Go down and get us a carton of milk,
some Ding Dongs and a newspaper.

852
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:58,089
Get yourself something, too.

853
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:03,117
Gonna be your last American food
for a while, baby.

854
01:27:10,289 --> 01:27:15,079
Come on, honey. Don't be down.
We're just getting to the good part.

855
01:27:23,129 --> 01:27:25,768
Step on it.
Berrutti's gonna be here in 20 minutes.

856
01:27:26,249 --> 01:27:28,843
We gotta vamoose outta these parts.

857
01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:36,808
Jesse.

858
01:27:36,889 --> 01:27:39,323
Shit! What?

859
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:44,805
Nothing. Just looking at you.

860
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:02,157
I've seen you someplace before.

861
01:28:02,249 --> 01:28:03,364
What?

862
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:06,600
- Are you on a TV show?
- No.

863
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:11,517
On a quiz show, huh?
Let's Make a Deal, right?

864
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:12,644
No.

865
01:28:13,529 --> 01:28:15,759
Thanks. I'll think of it.

866
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:42,722
Oh, merde!

867
01:29:23,809 --> 01:29:27,597
Hey, hop in.
We'll meet Berrutti down by the gate.

868
01:29:29,009 --> 01:29:33,002
- Where's my newspaper?
- I can't go with you, Jesse.

869
01:29:36,489 --> 01:29:39,481
Not now, sugar. Come on. What's wrong?

870
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:45,084
I called the police.
I told them you were here.

871
01:29:48,089 --> 01:29:50,683
What the fuck for?

872
01:29:53,449 --> 01:29:57,044
- It don't make any sense!
- It makes sense!

873
01:30:03,049 --> 01:30:05,244
No, it doesn't.

874
01:30:06,129 --> 01:30:09,599
- Monica, you love me.
- I don't want to love you!

875
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:13,003
I don't want to go with you!

876
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:19,605
Just now when I went down the hill,
I wanted to keep going on.

877
01:30:19,969 --> 01:30:22,278
I was not gonna come back.

878
01:30:23,529 --> 01:30:25,724
You love me. You say it!

879
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:28,919
I was not going to come back!

880
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:35,044
But I knew you would come after me

881
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:38,917
and I knew you wouldn't
stop coming after me!

882
01:30:40,529 --> 01:30:44,602
- But you love me! Now say it!
- It doesn't matter if I...

883
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:48,284
- Say it!
- It doesn't matter if I love you!

884
01:30:48,369 --> 01:30:50,360
It's wrong for us.

885
01:30:50,449 --> 01:30:53,361
You don't see, but I can't stop you, Jesse.

886
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:57,848
You're damn right you can't stop me.

887
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:02,161
That's why I called the police -
so that you would have to go!

888
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,207
Go, Jesse, please! Quickly!

889
01:31:12,169 --> 01:31:14,160
All right.

890
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:18,127
You say you don't love me. Then I'll go.

891
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:25,044
You gotta say it. Say it and I'll go.

892
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:28,963
It's easy. Go on. Say it.

893
01:31:29,769 --> 01:31:32,488
You can't say it, can you?

894
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,880
I don't love you.

895
01:31:40,609 --> 01:31:42,964
You liar.

896
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:47,121
- My little liar!
- Please, Jesse.

897
01:31:48,089 --> 01:31:49,886
My God! Berrutti!

898
01:31:51,889 --> 01:31:56,485
We can still make it, darlin'!
I know a hundred ways out of this town!

899
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:59,564
I'll be right back!

900
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:07,769
Berrutti! Get outta here quick!
The little French girl called the cops!

901
01:32:08,049 --> 01:32:10,688
- Get in the car, man!
- I can't leave her, Tony.

902
01:32:10,769 --> 01:32:15,047
Are you crazy, man? The broad
turned you in! You're gonna blow it all!

903
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:18,121
You know me, Tony. All or nothin'.

904
01:32:19,889 --> 01:32:22,449
We got the money!

905
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:25,039
It's all the way now, baby!

906
01:32:25,129 --> 01:32:28,201
Look, pal. This is all I can do for you now.

907
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:33,686
- Adios, amigo!
- You're whacked out of your skull!

908
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:46,762
Jesse!

909
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:51,801
Freeze!

910
01:32:52,969 --> 01:32:55,563
Don't do it! You'll be chopped meat!

911
01:32:59,129 --> 01:33:01,120
Put up your hands!

912
01:33:01,729 --> 01:33:03,720
Let's see your hands!

913
01:33:17,289 --> 01:33:20,087
# If you're gonna love me,
lover, please don't tease

914
01:33:20,169 --> 01:33:22,763
# If I can hold you, honey, let me squeeze

915
01:33:22,849 --> 01:33:25,443
# My head goes round and round

916
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:28,123
# And my love comes tumblin' down

917
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:29,802
No, Jesse!

918
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:39,407
# You... you leave me

919
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:45,959
Jesse! I love you, Jesse!

920
01:33:49,809 --> 01:33:51,879
# Breathless!

921
01:33:58,449 --> 01:34:01,202
# Now, if you love me, please don't tease

922
01:34:01,289 --> 01:34:03,644
# If I can hold you, then let me squeeze

923
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:07,881
# My heart goes round and round,
my love comes tumblin' down

924
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:12,884
# You leave me... ah... breathless!

925
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:17,483
