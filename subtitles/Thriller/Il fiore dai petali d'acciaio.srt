1
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,241
You're...

2
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,484
...from Baker?

3
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,129
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.

4
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,930
Tell him I want to live in peace,
understand?

5
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,836
That it's no use
to go on tormenting me!

6
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,770
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

7
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:00,968
Now that gold has disappeared.

8
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:04,479
But if he'd listened to me,
we could have avoided this altogether.

9
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,978
I went to the Army court.

10
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,744
There were no witnesses.

11
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,013
They couldn't uncover any more.

12
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,118
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

13
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,021
Go back and tell him that!

14
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,029
Word's around you had a visitor...

15
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,689
...and Baker knows it.

16
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,436
Name of Jackson.

17
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,473
Jackson was here...

18
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,708
...or Baker's got it all wrong.

19
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,047
He's not wrong.

20
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:53,995
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

21
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,425
...about the cash box.

22
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:03,066
That's not what I'm being paid for.

23
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,037
I'm only interested in
what name Jackson's hiding under now!

24
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,846
Why do you think Jackson
may be assuming another name?

25
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,410
I would have found him already.

26
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:23,422
When I start off to find somebody,
I find them.

27
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,789
That's why they pay me.

28
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,692
What is Baker paying you?

29
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,099
That your family?

30
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:48,881
Yes.

31
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,115
Nice family.

32
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,656
What does he pay you for murdering me?

33
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:01,423
$500...

34
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,989
...to get the name!

35
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,739
The name!

36
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,306
Carson.

37
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,579
Bill Carson.

38
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,517
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,380
Here's a lot of money: $1,000.

40
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,188
$1,000...

41
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,527
...and some in gold.

42
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,631
That's a tidy sum.

43
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,332
But when I'm paid...

44
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:20,871
...I always see the job through.

45
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,248
It's you.

46
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,715
Any information?

47
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,180
Too much.

48
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,591
He said quite a bit
that should interest you...

49
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,221
...and one or two things
that interested me.

50
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,231
Such as?

51
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,293
The name Jackson's hiding under is...

52
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,027
...Bill Carson.

53
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:59,240
That's your bit.

54
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,242
Keep talking.

55
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,273
He also mentioned somethin'
about a certain...

56
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,510
...cash box which just happened
to disappear.

57
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,052
That's my bit.

58
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,119
Anything else?

59
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,322
Not enough for you, huh?

60
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,426
Well, you don't have to worry.

61
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,963
He'll never say anything to anybody again!

62
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,857
Perfect.

63
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,365
Here you are.

64
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,332
Here, this is for you.

65
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,305
You did a good job for me.

66
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,102
Worth $500!

67
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,046
I almost forgot.

68
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,378
He gave me $1,000.

69
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,016
I think his idea was that I kill you.

70
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,787
But you know, the pity is,
when I'm paid...

71
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,654
...I always follow my job through.

72
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,661
You know that.

73
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,944
No pistol, amigo.

74
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,779
It won't do you any good.

75
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,443
There are three of us.

76
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,236
You know that you have a face
beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?

77
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,444
But you don't look like
the one who will collect it.

78
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,786
A couple of steps back.

79
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,501
Thank you.

80
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,882
How much you worth now?

81
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,615
How much?

82
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,117
$2,000!

83
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:39,687
That's right, $2,000.

84
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,892
Yeah, $2,000.

85
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,197
¡Hijo de puta que te parió!

86
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,100
You'll pay for this!

87
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,008
I hope you end up in a graveyard...

88
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,740
...with the cholera, and the rabies,
and the plague!

89
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:02,545
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!

90
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,915
Put me down!

91
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,853
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

92
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,413
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!

93
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,323
You can still save yourself.

94
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,090
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

95
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,888
Let me go!

96
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,833
I feel sick. The blood is rushing...

97
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,862
I'm dry.

98
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,738
Agua! Water!

99
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,006
You swine! You son of a bitch!

100
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,313
You're brave with a man who's tied up!

101
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,947
Come back!

102
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,924
Come back and fight!

103
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,928
You bastard!

104
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:49,296
Who the hell is that?

105
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:51,594
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

106
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,328
Cut it out! Cut it out!

107
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,701
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...

108
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,367
So, you're an honest farmer.

109
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,673
You recognize this man?

110
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,070
Yeah, it's you!

111
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,742
Who says so? You can't even read.

112
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,881
Roll it up. Roll it up!

113
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,548
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

114
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:19,720
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies
and all who gave birth to you!

115
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,525
Hey, everybody, look! Look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

116
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:23,723
Judas!

117
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,289
You've sold my hide!

118
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,126
But you won't enjoy any of that money,
not a penny.

119
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,195
If there's justice,
that money will go to the undertakers!

120
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,299
Every penny of it.
You know who you are?

121
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,774
You want to know whose son you are?

122
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,211
You don't, I do. Everybody does.

123
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,181
You're the son of a thousand fathers!

124
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,841
All bastards like you!

125
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,716
And your mother? Your mother...

126
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,220
You bastard!

127
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,786
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her.
I never hurt anybody!

128
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:56,188
...wanted in 14 counties of this state...

129
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:02,100
...the condemned is found guilty
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery...

130
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,401
...of citizens, state banks,
and post offices...

131
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:10,468
...the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison...

132
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,345
...perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children...

133
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:19,310
...inciting prostitution,
kidnapping, extortion...

134
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:22,448
...receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods...

135
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:27,461
...passing counterfeit money,
and contrary to the laws of this state...

136
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,688
...the condemned is guilty of using...

137
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,627
Therefore, according to
the powers vested in us...

138
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:39,171
...we sentence the accused
here before us...

139
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,972
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

140
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:44,372
...known as the "Rat"...

141
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,381
...and any other aliases he might have...

142
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,080
...to hang by the neck until dead.

143
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:53,519
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed!

144
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,507
Five for you.

145
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,545
One, two, three, four...

146
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:26,379
...five for me.

147
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,049
Five for you...

148
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,685
...and five for me.

149
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:35,053
Know how much you're worth now?

150
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,030
No, how much?

151
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,723
$3,000!

152
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,337
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend.

153
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,669
Those with a rope around their neck...

154
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,471
...and the people who have the job
of doing the cutting.

155
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,741
Listen, the neck at the end
of the rope is mine!

156
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,873
I run the risks.

157
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:58,753
So, the next time, I want more than half!

158
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,422
You may run the risks, my friend, but...

159
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,754
...I do the cutting.

160
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,727
If we cut down my percentage...

161
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,531
Cigar?

162
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,659
...it might interfere with my aim.

163
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,838
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

164
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:24,706
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive...

165
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,976
...he understands nothing about Tuco.

166
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,576
Nothing!

167
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:36,590
Wanted in 15 counties of this state...

168
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:40,526
...the condemned, standing before us...
sitting before us...

169
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:43,894
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

170
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:46,263
...has been found guilty
by the Third District Circuit Court...

171
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:50,202
...of the following crimes:
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace...

172
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,740
...raping a virgin of the white race...

173
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:56,766
...and statutory rape
of a minor of the black race...

174
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:00,672
...of derailing a train
in order to rob the passengers...

175
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:08,151
What'd you find out, Shorty?

176
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:10,088
If you ask me, it seems like a book!

177
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:14,390
An armed unit, escorting a cash box
of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...

178
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,920
...and only three of them are saved.

179
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:19,432
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

180
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,969
The thing that wasn't saved, though,
was the coins.

181
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,835
But then the Army decides, of course,
it ought to hold a hearing...

182
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,032
...and Jackson's acquitted.

183
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,974
He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.

184
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:30,111
I know his name.

185
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:33,341
But you don't know
just who you're lookin' for, and I do!

186
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:37,408
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!

187
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,722
- Where is Carson?
- All I know is Carson re-enlisted.

188
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,281
The poor guy's minus an eye.

189
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,520
He lives with a girl called Maria,
who'll tell you.

190
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,063
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

191
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,119
Where is she?

192
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:54,134
Now, what's the name of that town?
It's someplace very near...

193
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,469
Santa Ana.

194
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,343
Adiós, half-soldier.

195
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,644
Hand me down a whiskey!

196
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:24,494
Glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes!

197
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:26,764
People with ropes around their necks
don't always hang.

198
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,269
What do you mean?

199
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:34,338
Even a filthy beggar like that
has a protecting angel.

200
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,415
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

201
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,215
Of all these crimes, the accused
has made a full, spontaneous confession.

202
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:52,488
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

203
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,859
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

204
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,044
Let's get the hell out of here!

205
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:47,106
What are you saying?
Anybody can miss a shot?

206
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,116
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope!

207
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:52,813
You never had a rope around your neck.
Well, I'm going to tell you something.

208
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:57,256
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass!

209
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,029
Yeah, you're right.

210
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,661
It's getting tougher.

211
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,431
The way I figure...

212
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:11,734
...there's really not too much future
with a sawed-off runt like you.

213
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,205
What do you mean?

214
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:17,438
'Cause I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than $3,000.

215
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,039
What do you mean?

216
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:23,343
I mean, our partnership is untied.

217
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,053
Oh no, not you.

218
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,055
You remain tied.

219
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,024
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.

220
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:35,287
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

221
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,227
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

222
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,332
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

223
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:44,633
Adiós.

224
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:47,732
You filthy bastard! Come here!

225
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,044
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse!

226
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,273
Get off that horse! You filthy coward!

227
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:54,508
If I ever catch you...

228
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:56,743
...I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

229
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,584
I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your tongue.

230
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:04,893
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

231
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:04,928
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

232
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,988
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.

233
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,907
You wouldn't leave me here...

234
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:21,464
Come back!

235
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:24,034
Wait! Listen, Blondie!

236
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,741
¡Hijo de una gran puta!

237
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,687
You filthy rats!

238
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,562
Maria.

239
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,505
Is that you, Bill?

240
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:48,493
Who are you?

241
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:50,654
What do you want with me?

242
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,666
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

243
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,534
I don't know him.

244
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,470
You were calling to him in the dark!

245
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:05,204
Where is he?

246
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,942
What are you gonna do?

247
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,679
I'll ask the questions!

248
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,055
Where is he?

249
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,563
Where is he?

250
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,301
That's enough!

251
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,800
I don't know where he is.

252
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:40,439
He packed his things ten days ago,
and went away with his unit.

253
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:42,039
They all left.

254
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,516
Which company? Where'd he go?

255
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:51,392
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.

256
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,323
They left for Santa Fe.

257
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:57,092
That's all I know. I swear!

258
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,484
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

259
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,662
Revolvers?

260
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,798
Revolvers!

261
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,738
Here's where I keep the best ones.

262
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,617
Remington, Colt, Farroute...

263
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,889
...Smith Wesson, Colt, from the Navy...

264
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:40,523
Jocelyn, another Remington, and this...

265
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,826
That's enough.

266
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,699
Cartridges.

267
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,045
- You wanna try the pistol, just step...
- Let's go.

268
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:04,261
Cartridge.

269
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,171
How much?

270
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:15,112
$20.

271
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,854
$50.

272
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,956
How much?

273
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,319
$100.

274
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:35,026
$200. It's all I've got!

275
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,347
Come here!

276
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,352
This morning I heard the whole thing.

277
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:32,654
They say Colonel Canby's closing in
with his Northerners...

278
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,560
...and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

279
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:38,621
That's why these Southerners
are getting out!

280
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:42,965
You see, as soon as these cowards hear
there are blue shirts around, they run.

281
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,972
- These rebels have no will to fight!
- Poor things.

282
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,632
They'll soon be finished.

283
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,868
We get rid of these bastards...

284
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,377
...then we begin making money
on those Yankees.

285
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:55,677
They carry gold, not paper dollars.
And they're going to beat the South.

286
00:38:56,884 --> 00:39:00,081
Look, see that one with the white beard
sitting in the wagon?

287
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,988
General Sibley. He looks dead.
He's finally getting out of our hair.

288
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:07,027
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

289
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,258
Where's the owner of that horse?

290
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,030
Please, mister, sir...

291
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,129
...a bad heart condition...
- Where?

292
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,674
The war has frightened me already.

293
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:24,376
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

294
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,676
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,
and he's a pig!

302
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,377
Where is he now?!

303
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,317
You leave him be! He doesn't know
who rides every horse!

304
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:35,184
You stay quiet, old hen!

305
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:39,757
Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room 4, señor.

306
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,933
Hear that?

307
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:55,398
You rotten criminals, how dare you?!

308
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:54,816
Your spurs.

309
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:09,764
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.

310
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,738
Those that come in by the door...

311
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:15,331
...and those that come in by the window.

312
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,775
Take off that pistol belt.

313
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,053
It's empty.

314
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,180
Mine isn't.

315
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:41,223
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

316
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:47,073
That could be cannon fire.

317
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:50,702
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you!

318
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:55,811
You ever see this before, my friend?

319
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:07,553
Throw it over the roof beam.

320
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,421
That's it.

321
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:24,570
And get on that!

322
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,084
That's right.

323
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,590
Now, make sure the rope is tight!

324
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:41,827
It's got to hold the weight of a pig!

325
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,834
Now, put the rope around your neck!

326
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,469
Yes, very good.

327
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,540
It's too big for your neck?

328
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,550
We'll fix that right away.

329
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,313
I have another system.

330
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:09,185
A little different than yours.

331
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,414
I don't shoot the rope.

332
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:13,824
I shoot the legs off the stool!

333
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:19,926
Adiós.

334
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:25,375
...guilty of the following crimes:
horse theft...

335
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,931
And Shorty?

336
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:11,523
Sorry, Shorty!

337
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,800
Move, come on, let's go!

338
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:42,557
I don't know. As soon as I hit
the desert, I'm thirsty.

339
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:43,989
Burns, huh?

340
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,830
They say people with fair skin
can't take too much.

341
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,492
Like that, you won't
have to carry so much.

342
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,798
Where are we going?

343
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,461
Where?

344
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:22,900
Where I'm going, amigo.

345
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,194
Over that way.

346
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,730
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sunbaked sand.

347
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:31,909
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

348
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,276
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

349
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:37,111
Canby's men are coming here...

350
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:41,119
...but no one will set foot in this hell...

351
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:44,489
...except you and me.

352
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:49,189
One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.

353
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:54,793
What was it you told me the last time?

354
00:50:56,269 --> 00:51:00,467
"If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it."

355
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:05,335
And if you won't manage it, you'll die.

356
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:06,936
Only slowly.

357
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:10,516
Very slowly, old friend.

358
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:18,690
After you, please. Start walking.

359
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,234
Taking a rest?

360
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:22,080
Come on, Blondie, we don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

361
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,212
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

362
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,652
That's not too bad.

363
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,521
Come on!

364
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,683
And so, Blondie...

365
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:41,978
...it's goodbye.

366
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:31,877
$200,000 in gold. It's yours.
Just get me water!

367
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,385
What's that you say?

368
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:40,983
Who the hell are you?

369
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:45,762
My name's Bill Carson now.

370
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,258
Surprise attack.

371
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:51,035
All dead.

372
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,198
My name is Jackson. Not Carson.

373
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:56,439
Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.

374
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:00,104
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What was that you said about the dollars?

375
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,272
$200,000, all mine.

376
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,110
Was the Third Cavalry's.

377
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,645
Baker has nothing.

378
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:10,415
The gold...

379
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,425
I hid the gold. The gold is safe!

380
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,058
Where? Here?

381
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,092
Talk!

382
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:21,624
In the cemetery.

383
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,692
Which cemetery?

384
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:27,103
On Sad Hill.

385
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:29,004
There's a grave by the...

386
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:31,332
Which grave?

387
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,879
Have a name? Have a number?

388
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:36,346
Come on, you dummy, talk!

389
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:40,248
There's no number.

390
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,177
There's a name.

391
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,551
It's written.

392
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:53,462
Water!

393
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:59,033
You talk first, eh?
I'll give you the water later!

394
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:00,867
Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?

395
01:01:00,973 --> 01:01:02,201
In a grave, okay.

396
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:04,869
But it must have
a name or a number on it.

397
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:07,969
There must be 1,000, 5,000, you!

398
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:13,751
Don't die.

399
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,186
Don't die! I'll get you water!

400
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:19,656
Stay there.
Don't move, I'll get you water.

401
01:01:19,726 --> 01:01:22,092
Don't die until later!

402
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,117
Get away from there!

403
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:57,424
He's dead.

404
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:02,796
I'll kill you!

405
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:08,435
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

406
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:12,706
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

407
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,307
If I were you, I'd...

408
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:17,209
...keep me alive.

409
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,815
What did he tell you?

410
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,013
A name.

411
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:25,087
Name on a grave.

412
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,019
What name?

413
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:42,866
Blondie, don't die.

414
01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:46,411
Don't die! I'm your friend.

415
01:02:46,646 --> 01:02:50,241
Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!

416
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:55,747
I'll help you. I'll help you!

417
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:58,791
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

418
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,326
Don't die like that pig.

419
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,523
Water, Blondie?

420
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,622
Don't drink! It's no good for you.

421
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,599
Feel better?

422
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:12,365
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die!

423
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:42,430
I've got a very sick man here.

424
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:43,992
But we have no more beds here.

425
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,470
Let him have yours!

426
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:53,975
- Where is Pablo Ramirez?
- Padre Ramirez.

427
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:55,707
He is away at the moment.

428
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:58,314
He should be back any day now.

429
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:02,854
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we'll take very good care of my friend.

430
01:04:02,955 --> 01:04:04,513
May God be praised.

431
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,818
In case you didn't know it...

432
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:09,760
...God is on our side, too.
Because he hates the Yanks.

433
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:12,930
Father, is he still breathing?

434
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:15,126
Yes, of course.

435
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,668
You're heavy.

436
01:04:59,545 --> 01:05:02,480
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.

437
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:05,679
Put him in my cell.

438
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:13,123
Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.

439
01:05:13,225 --> 01:05:17,252
Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me!

440
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:39,046
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

441
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:12,077
Did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

442
01:06:12,151 --> 01:06:14,915
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.

443
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:18,855
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.

444
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:21,755
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

445
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:26,059
Thank you, Father. You don't know
how much this boy's life means to me!

446
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:48,541
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

447
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:52,115
You're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

448
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,851
Think, if you'd been on your own.

449
01:07:57,223 --> 01:07:58,781
I mean, when...

450
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:01,326
...when one is ill...

451
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,096
...it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

452
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,690
Do you...

453
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:10,963
...you have parents, Blondie?

454
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:12,927
A mother?

455
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,269
Not even a mother.

456
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,305
No one.

457
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,043
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

458
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:24,444
We're all alone in the world.

459
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,508
I have you, you have me.

460
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:31,920
Only for a little while, I mean.

461
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:34,225
It had to happen now.

462
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:37,395
What a dirty rotten trick of fate!

463
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:40,591
We could have all that money
in our hands.

464
01:08:46,972 --> 01:08:49,532
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.

465
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:52,839
In my place, you would do the same thing.

466
01:08:54,313 --> 01:08:56,543
It's all over for you now.

467
01:08:57,249 --> 01:09:00,218
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.

468
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:06,654
It's my fault! Mine, mine!

469
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:23,173
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
If I knew that my last hour had come...

470
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:27,679
...I swear, in my place, in your place,
I would do the same thing.

471
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,179
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes I would!

472
01:09:32,284 --> 01:09:34,752
I would tell the name on the grave.

473
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,516
After all, what good is the money to you
if you're dead?

474
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,649
I know the name of the cemetery.

475
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:42,853
But you know how many graves
there are there?

476
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,122
Please.

477
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,200
Please, have a little.

478
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,472
Coffee? Please tell me the name.

479
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,066
On the grave.

480
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,903
If I get my hands on the $200,000...

481
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:06,343
...I'll always honor your memory.

482
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:09,947
I swear it! I'll always honor your memory!

483
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:14,993
Come closer.

484
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:21,091
Tell me.

485
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:29,003
I'll sleep better...

486
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:32,870
...knowing my good friend...

487
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:35,137
...is by my side...

488
01:10:35,214 --> 01:10:36,738
...to protect me.

489
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:49,758
"Tuco, water. Please, water."

490
01:10:49,862 --> 01:10:53,389
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water!

491
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:03,406
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed!

492
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:05,602
Come on, come on, the party's over.

493
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,407
The wagon is all ready to go.

494
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,572
From the way the wounded
are pouring into this place...

495
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:12,913
...we better get the hell out of here
before we get caught up in the war.

496
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:15,886
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

497
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:20,548
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

498
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,320
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

499
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:41,171
Hey, Pablo!

500
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,851
Don't you recognize me?

501
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:55,088
It's me, Tuco!

502
01:11:55,694 --> 01:11:58,026
Let me embrace you.

503
01:12:00,866 --> 01:12:03,801
I don't know the right thing!

504
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:10,471
I was just passing by here.
I said to myself...

505
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:14,376
...I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother.

506
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:18,880
Did I do wrong?

507
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:22,580
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

508
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:24,952
You've seen me, Tuco.

509
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,519
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

510
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:38,302
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.

511
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:42,803
Let's talk about you. It's more important.

512
01:12:43,308 --> 01:12:45,139
You look very well.

513
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,106
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

514
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:52,350
...you always were thin, eh Pablito?

515
01:12:55,387 --> 01:12:57,446
What about our parents?

516
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,954
Only now do you think of them?

517
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:04,152
To begin after nine years?

518
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:08,230
Nine years?

519
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:10,968
So it's nine years.

520
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,532
Our mother has been dead a long time.

521
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:22,077
Our father died only a few days ago.

522
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,047
That's why I was away.

523
01:13:25,918 --> 01:13:28,318
He asked for you to be there.

524
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,719
But there was only me.

525
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:39,554
And you?

526
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:42,759
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

527
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:47,628
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

528
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:52,101
Not one, lots of them!

529
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,839
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

530
01:13:56,048 --> 01:13:58,846
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

531
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:02,918
What good would that be?

532
01:14:04,156 --> 01:14:06,624
Just keep on the way you're going.

533
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,125
Go away.

534
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:10,789
The Lord have mercy on your soul.

535
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,458
I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me...

536
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:18,196
...I., Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez...

537
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,261
...will tell you something.

538
01:14:20,339 --> 01:14:22,330
You think you're better than I am.

539
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:25,069
Where we came from,
if one did not want to die of poverty...

540
01:14:25,144 --> 01:14:27,544
...one became a priest or a bandit!

541
01:14:27,613 --> 01:14:30,207
You chose your way, I chose mine.

542
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:31,943
Mine was harder.

543
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:33,813
You talk of our mother and father.

544
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,013
You remember when you left
to become a priest.

545
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:37,487
I stayed behind!

546
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:41,390
I must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but I stayed.

547
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,860
I tried, but it was no good.

548
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:46,090
Now I am going to tell you something.

549
01:14:46,165 --> 01:14:47,689
You became a priest because you were...

550
01:14:47,766 --> 01:14:50,758
...too much of a coward to do what I do!

551
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,563
Please, forgive me, brother.

552
01:15:53,265 --> 01:15:54,926
My belly's full.

553
01:15:56,768 --> 01:15:58,702
Nice guy, my brother.

554
01:15:59,071 --> 01:16:01,437
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here.

555
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:03,701
Everything, like the pope almost.

556
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:05,709
He's in charge in Rome.

557
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:09,269
My brother, he says to me:
"Stay, brother, don't go home.

558
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:11,111
"We never see each other.

559
01:16:11,183 --> 01:16:15,620
"Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend, too."

560
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,053
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

561
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:20,523
It's always the same story.

562
01:16:20,592 --> 01:16:23,254
My brother, he's crazy about me.

563
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:27,997
That's so.

564
01:16:28,066 --> 01:16:31,399
Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens...

565
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:37,699
...I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.

566
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:40,510
Sure.

567
01:16:41,913 --> 01:16:45,849
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing like a good cigar.

568
01:17:53,852 --> 01:17:55,319
Wake up, you!

569
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,120
The troops are coming!

570
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:59,214
Blue or gray?

571
01:18:05,997 --> 01:18:10,457
They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"
to them and then get going.

572
01:18:11,203 --> 01:18:14,468
Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!

573
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,598
Down with General Grant!

574
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,609
Hurrah for General... what's his name?

575
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:20,702
Lee!

576
01:18:22,748 --> 01:18:26,184
God is with us
because he hates the Yanks, too!

577
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:31,719
God is not on our side
'cause he hates idiots also.

578
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:53,237
Prisoners of war...

579
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,006
...forward...

580
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:57,108
...march!

581
01:19:59,911 --> 01:20:02,175
Form a single file.

582
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,567
Robert Clark.

583
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:04,870
Present.

584
01:21:05,844 --> 01:21:07,106
Sam Richmond.

585
01:21:07,178 --> 01:21:08,406
Present.

586
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,017
Bill Carson.

587
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,282
I said Bill Carson!

588
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:24,994
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

589
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,761
All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!

590
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,799
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.

591
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:39,208
That's me!

592
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:49,713
Please, Carson.

593
01:21:50,889 --> 01:21:52,618
Answer, "Present"!

594
01:21:54,259 --> 01:21:56,420
What are you, deaf?

595
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,069
Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.

596
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:09,372
I like big fat men like you.

597
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:11,841
When they fall, they make more noise.

598
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,470
And sometimes they never get up.

599
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:17,278
Wallace...

600
01:22:18,783 --> 01:22:20,512
...that's enough.

601
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:24,985
Sergeant!

602
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:29,516
The captain wants to see you right away.

603
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:35,297
Be sure these two get good treatment.

604
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:49,006
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment!

605
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,411
For the last time, sergeant...

606
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,582
...I'm telling you...

607
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:02,752
...I want the prisoners
treated as prisoners.

608
01:23:03,495 --> 01:23:05,292
No more brutality!

609
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:10,198
There's hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them.

610
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:12,600
What am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect!

611
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:17,506
I think that you'll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better!

612
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:21,471
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville Camp?

613
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:24,310
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville!

614
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,714
While I'm in charge here,
the prisoners are not to be...

615
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:27,911
...tortured...

616
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:29,681
...or cheated...

617
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:31,580
...or murdered!

618
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,687
Is that an accusation?

619
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:37,091
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away...

620
01:23:37,896 --> 01:23:39,523
...not my eyes.

621
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:42,691
I know the prisoners here are being
robbed systematically.

622
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:46,601
I know there's scum around,
or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...

623
01:23:46,671 --> 01:23:49,572
...for someone to deliver this loot.

624
01:23:49,641 --> 01:23:53,407
But as long as I'm commandant,
I won't permit any such trickery!

625
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,037
Am I clear?

626
01:23:56,848 --> 01:23:58,145
Yes, sir.

627
01:23:58,316 --> 01:24:01,410
Just as long as you're the commandant.

628
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:04,045
Yes, sergeant.

629
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:10,258
I know this leg means
I won't last very long...

630
01:24:10,328 --> 01:24:13,195
...but I pray I can manage
to have enough time...

631
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:18,258
...to amass evidence and bring to a
court-martial all those who discredit...

632
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,564
...and dishonor the uniform...

633
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,501
...of the Union!

634
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:29,441
I wish you luck.

638
01:25:04,082 --> 01:25:06,915
You and the others better lay low
for a few days.

639
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:11,814
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

640
01:25:24,235 --> 01:25:26,703
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.

641
01:25:41,252 --> 01:25:44,244
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

642
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,582
But we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

643
01:25:47,992 --> 01:25:49,926
Come on, saddle your horses.

644
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:02,037
Come on in, Tuco.

645
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,297
Don't be bashful.

646
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,474
There's no formalities, here.

647
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:20,758
It's been a long time!

648
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:25,589
You're hungry.

649
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,259
Sit down. Eat!

650
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:49,482
I knew it, I knew it!

651
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:53,483
The minute I saw you, I said to myself:

652
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,026
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes...

653
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,897
"...I'll bet he's got himself an easy job!

654
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:06,260
"And he never forgets a friend!"

655
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:09,265
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

656
01:27:13,244 --> 01:27:15,212
It's good to see old friends again.

657
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:21,145
Especially when they come
from so far away...

658
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,184
...and have so much to talk about.
