1
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,353
<i>They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

2
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,152
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in my life, I agree.</i>

3
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,839
<i>I wish...</i>

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,790
<i>...I had never uncovered</i>
<i>the awful truth.</i>

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,798
<i>I know now...</i>

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,595
<i>...once they find out,</i>
<i>they will try to silence me.</i>

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,759
<i>That is why I've written this</i>
<i>all down for you in this letter.</i>

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,799
<i>You are the only one</i>
<i>whom I can tell this to.</i>

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,959
<i>The only one who could</i>
<i>possibly understand.</i>

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,555
<i>Good luck, my friend.</i>

11
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,512
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

12
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,351
Mr. Fuller,
nice having you here.

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,397
Your usual table?

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,156
No, thanks, Gene.

15
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,755
Her name is Erika.

16
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,029
She's from Toledo.

17
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,392
Ashton, would you do me a favor?

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,919
You'd like to meet her?

19
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,753
I want you...

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,552
...to keep this letter.

21
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,355
Somebody will ask for it.
A man named Douglas Hall.

22
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,230
Remember, it's crucial
that he receives it.

23
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,353
It's a walk in the park.

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,999
Going home, Mr. Fuller?

25
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,758
Yes, Charlie.

26
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,758
We're out of cat food, honey.

27
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,951
Yes, I'll buy some in the morning.

28
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,032
You've been smoking again.

29
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,033
<i>Download complete.</i>

30
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,152
<i>Link to simulation terminated.</i>

31
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,158
Martini, please.

32
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,756
One martini.

33
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,793
You forgot the olive.

34
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,352
We're out of olives.

35
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,195
How about pretzels?

36
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,159
No, thank you.

37
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,550
<i>Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

38
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,955
Douglas, it's me.

39
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,156
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

40
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,793
This changes everything.

41
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,796
I don't know...

42
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,829
I don't even know how to begin.

43
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,359
What are you doing?

44
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,350
<i>You have new messages.</i>

45
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,950
<i>You have new messages.</i>

46
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,032
<i>You have three new messages.</i>

47
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,073
<i>First new message: 5:25 a.m.</i>

48
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,951
<i>Douglas, it's Hilary.</i>
<i>Don't forget to call Marshall.</i>

49
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,151
<i>Legal is screaming</i>
<i>for the contract.</i>

50
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,593
<i>I'll have a notary come</i>
<i>to the office at lunch.</i>

51
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,354
<i>Next new message: 5:48 a.m.</i>

52
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,596
<i>It's me again.</i>
<i>Please call me as soon as you get up.</i>

53
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,349
<i>Next new message: 6:13 a.m.</i>

54
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,112
<i>Mr. Douglas Hall,</i>
<i>this is Detective McBain, LAPD.</i>

55
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,231
<i>I'd appreciate a callback, please.</i>

56
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,796
<i>My phone number is 555-7876.</i>

57
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,513
I'm Detective Zev Bernstein.

58
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,109
Sorry to drag you
out of bed so early.

59
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,749
This is Detective McBain.

60
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,594
Mr. Hall?

61
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,392
Thanks for coming down.

62
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,789
Where is he?

63
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,798
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, thank you.

64
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,355
That him?

65
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,034
We found him in an alley
at Spring and Grand.

66
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,190
Looks like he ran into some guy
who wasn't just asking for a quarter.

67
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,992
Carved him up like a ham.

68
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,470
Took everything:
wallet, credit cards.

69
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,639
Got a kick out of it.

70
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,790
What's your connection
to the old man?

71
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,355
I worked with him for six years.

72
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,352
He was my boss.

73
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,599
My friend.

74
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,558
Hey, cigarette?

75
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,359
I don't smoke.

76
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,358
We found these on him.

77
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,588
Traced the prescription.
According to his doctor...

78
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,435
...Fuller listed you to call
in case of medical emergencies.

79
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,359
He had no next of kin?

80
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,558
No, he didn't.

81
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,994
You sure?

82
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,351
I think he would've told me.

83
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,751
Have any idea who killed him?

84
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,952
Everybody liked him.

85
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,351
Mind if I tag along?

86
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,955
Or we can continue in my office,
if that's more convenient.

87
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,348
That's fine.

88
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,431
<i>What do you do</i>
<i>for a paycheck, anyway?</i>

89
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,959
Computer software.

90
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,038
Would you mind taking care
of the car this morning?

91
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,557
- Must make some decent bucks, huh?
- I make a living.

92
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,831
- This was his apartment.
- You could be home already.

93
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,828
I see these signs
every time I leave work:

94
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,350
"You could be home already.
Apartment living in downtown."

95
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,194
Never expected it could look
anything like this.

96
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,790
This company was Fuller's life.
He worked and lived here.

97
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,152
So what exactly
do you people do here?

98
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,672
You wouldn't be interested.

99
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,996
I'm paid to be interested.

100
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,952
Computer research.

101
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,036
Fuller was onto...

102
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,032
...a whole new frontier.

103
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,557
Very sensitive material.

104
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,318
Not at liberty to discuss it.

105
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,274
A lot of money involved.

106
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,559
This apartment must be worth
a few million dollars.

107
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,471
One of the perks of the job.

108
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,754
This job has a whole lot of perks.

109
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,513
Can I help you?

110
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,949
I just talked to him two days ago.

111
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,231
I can't believe he's gone.

112
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,555
My name is Jane Fuller.

113
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,909
Hannon was my father.

114
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,710
I'm sorry.
I'm Douglas Hall.

115
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,794
You're the one
he always wanted me to meet.

116
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,715
He never mentioned
that he had a daughter.

117
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,959
He didn't?

118
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,154
I arrived from Paris this morning.
I was supposed to meet him.

119
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,355
But then I heard.

120
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,630
My condolences, Miss Fuller.

121
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,558
I'm Detective McBain, LAPD.

122
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,872
I have to ask you some questions.

123
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,673
- Of course.
- Would you excuse us, Mr. Hall?

124
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,155
Sure.

125
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,076
Have we ever met before?

126
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,432
No, that's not possible.

127
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,869
You look very familiar.

128
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,597
Nice to meet you, Miss Fuller.

129
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,917
Hey, Whitney.
How you doing?

130
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,951
Sliced him up like an animal.

131
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,274
And for what?

132
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,115
He was the Einstein of our generation.
It's a waste.

133
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,869
What the hell happened
while I was away?

134
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,954
He was jacking
into the system a lot.

135
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,910
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?

136
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,236
We're months away
from the first trial run.

137
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,352
We are. You know, he was
taking a big chance.

138
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,668
What was I supposed to do?
You know how he is.

139
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,228
Were there complications?

140
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,034
None that I know of yet.

141
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,190
Did he ever tell you
he had a daughter?

142
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,912
- Why?
- Because I just met her.

143
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,548
You're kidding me.

144
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,352
John, I need the number
of that cab company.

145
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,794
No need, sir.

146
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,752
She went to the Omni Hotel.

147
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,788
Detective McBain.

148
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,151
Sorry to disappoint you.

149
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,589
I'll find Doug.

150
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,149
It's you I wanted to talk with.

151
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,476
What for?

152
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,831
Want me to catch your boss's killer?

153
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,795
Of course.

154
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,590
The whole thing's
a giant computer game?

155
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,753
No, it doesn't need a user
to interact with it to function.

156
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,396
Its units are fully formed,
self-learning cyber beings.

157
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,393
- Units?
- Electronic, simulated characters.

158
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,710
They populate the system.

159
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,989
They think...

160
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,389
...they work...

161
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,789
...they eat.

162
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,234
They fuck?

163
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,600
Let's just say that
they're modeled after us.

164
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,958
Right now, we have a working prototype:
Los Angeles, circa 1937.

165
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,476
Why '37?

166
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,799
Fuller wanted to start by re-creating
the era of his youth.

167
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,150
You see...

168
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,954
...while my mind is jacked in...

169
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,791
...I'm walking around
experiencing 1937.

170
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,678
My body stays here...

171
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,918
...and holds the consciousness
of the program link unit.

172
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,278
You think one of them units
crawled up an extension cord...

173
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,799
...and killed its maker?

174
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,958
Miss Fuller checked in yet?

175
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,548
Miss Fuller.

176
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,953
Glad I caught you.

177
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,559
Mr. Hall.

178
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,711
What are you doing here?

179
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,434
It's about your father, actually.

180
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,234
You said you spoke with him
a few days ago.

181
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,189
Can you tell me anything
about that conversation?

182
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,756
Did he seem strange to you at all?

183
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,160
He'd been under
a lot of stress lately.

184
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,353
He asked me to fly to the States,
so I could help with the company.

185
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,114
Help him run it?

186
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,755
Shut it down.

187
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,391
I worked with him for six years.
If he wanted to shut it down...

188
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,676
...he would've told me about it.

189
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,996
He didn't tell you about me.

190
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,198
But I wish he had.

191
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,593
It's nice to see you again.

192
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,196
Sorry I'm late.
Have you looked through the paperwork?

193
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,995
Yes, I have. And I think
we have a very strong case.

194
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,475
The company should be
yours in no time.

195
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,359
- Strong case?
- What I'm saying is, your father...

196
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,398
...changed his will
in favor of the employees.

197
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,876
In fact, you aren't mentioned
in the original will either.

198
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,351
But as I said, I think
we have a very strong case.

199
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,559
Who will head the board now?

200
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,150
Douglas Hall.

201
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,915
<i>Not bad.</i>

202
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,590
Owner of a $2 billion enterprise.

203
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,676
Strange, Fuller would amend
his will just before he died.

204
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,276
I was on an airplane
when it happened.

205
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,352
According to the security guard,
Fuller left the office at 10:30 p.m.

206
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,432
30 minutes after your plane arrived.

207
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,109
Autopsy shows that
he died around midnight.

208
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,192
- You had time to catch up with him.
- But I didn't.

209
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,270
- I went straight home.
- Didn't talk to him?

210
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,590
No e-mails, no faxes,
not even a message?

211
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,795
None of the above.

212
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,953
You know, that's funny.

213
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,710
We checked Fuller's phone records.

214
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,117
He made a call with
his calling card at 11:02 p.m.

215
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,155
Shit!

216
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,109
Your home number.

217
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,349
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave town for a couple of days.

218
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,550
And get that game fixed.

219
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,075
It's missing a spring.

220
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,999
<i>You have no new...</i>

221
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,151
<i>Restore. Restore.</i>

222
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,596
<i>To restore messages,</i>
<i>press "rewind" now.</i>

223

- <i>I managed to reschedule...</i>

224
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,717
- <i>Yesterday at 5:14 p.m.</i>
- <i>Hello, Mr. Hall...</i>

225
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,833
- <i>Yesterday at 11:02 p.m.</i>
- <i>Douglas, it's me.</i>

226
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,157
<i>Listen, I've stumbled</i>
<i>onto something incredible.</i>

227
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,793
<i>This changes everything.</i>

228
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,555
<i>I'm here in some bar on Main and 7th.</i>

229
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,753
<i>In case something happens to me,</i>
<i>I left you a message in the system.</i>

230
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,552
<i>I gave it to...</i>

231
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,757
<i>How did you find me?</i>

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,353
What's going on?

233
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,758
I'm trying to get
into Fuller's files.

234
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,753
For what?

235
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,114
He left a message for me
the night he died.

236
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,155
- He knew someone wanted to kill him.
- Did you tell the police?

237
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,196
Why not?

238
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,953
He also said he left a message
for me in the system.

239
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,799
Douglas, please.
This is my stuff, okay?

240
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,035
These are the units that Fuller
interacted with when he was there.

241
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,314
Maybe he wanted me to go in.

242
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking...

243
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,316
...don't even think about it.

244
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,475
I need your help.

245
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,910
No, no, no. I won't help you.

246
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,475
- It's a serious risk.
- I have to get in.

247
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,753
You could die.

248
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,639
The cops think I killed him.

249
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,188
They may be right.

250
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,755
- What do you mean?
- Everything points to me.

251
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,548
To be perfectly honest,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

252
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,876
Either I did murder Fuller and
I can't remember, or I'm being framed.

253
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,833
The one clue I have is in that machine.

254
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,998
I need your help
if I'm going to find it.

255
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,513
I'll set it for an hour.

256
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,319
Set it for 120 minutes.

257
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,709
Sixty is better.

258
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,319
120 minutes, Whit.

259
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,829
60 is safer.
I'm setting it at 60.

260
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,272
1-2-0.

261
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,035

You owe me 12 dollars
and five cents.

269
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,989
Listen, young man!

270
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,679
I do not have all day!

271
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,156
Ferguson, anything wrong?

272
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,955
John, are you okay?

273
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,351
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Someone will be right with you.

274
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,550
Oh, my God.

275
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,951
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. Don't smoke.

276
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,353
Since when?

277
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,312
Listen, John...

278
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,552
...why don't you...

279
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,517
Why don't you break for lunch?

280
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,631
Get some fresh air.

281
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,558
You look terrible.

282
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,039
I think I look pretty good.

283
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,355
Extra! Extra!
Zeppelin blast kills 35!

284
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,112
You want one, mister?
It's five cents.

285
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,597
Hey, watch out, buddy!

286
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,795
- How much to Pasadena?
- 90 cents.

287
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,151
- If I forget to turn the meter on.
- I understand.

288
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,316
This is it, 117 Winston.

289
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,637
- Do you mind waiting?
- It'll be a pleasure, sir.

290
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,038
- Tell me if you need any help.
- Thank you.

291
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,152
You own this place?

292
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,949
I mean, it's not much...

293
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,948
...but it's mine.

294
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,673
You looking for anything
in particular?

295
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,832
Interested in a scientist.

296
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,989
Wrote a couple of books...

297
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,952
...about semiconductors...

298
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,469
...and the limitations
of the 64-bit microchip.

299
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,353
Microchip.

300
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,673
Semiconductors.

301
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,550
What year?

302
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,158
Early '70s?

303
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,149
His name was Hannon Fuller.

304
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,953
Hannon Fuller.

305
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,199
1870.

306
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,555
No, I can't say I've ever heard of...

307
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,918
...Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.

308
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,557
But I'm not much of a
technical person, you know.

309
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,472
You been here before?
You look kind of familiar.

310
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,191
Name's Douglas Hall.

311
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,192
It doesn't ring a bell.

312
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,640
Guess you just have
one of those faces...

313
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,149
...familiar faces.
Oh, it's late.

314
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,796
I'd like to close up now.

315
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,714
Of course.

316
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,829
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hall.

317
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,311
1257 Palo Alto Road,
La Cienega Heights.

318
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,078
I guess that's it.

319
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,194
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

320
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,719
What do you want her for?

321
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,351
- I want to ask her some questions.
- She got a job now. I'm her mother.

322
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,477
Can you tell me
where I can find her?

323
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,472
You a copper?

324
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,073
Now, listen.

325
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,754
She ain't doing
nothing wrong no more.

326
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,110
If you don't cause her no trouble...

327
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,073
...you'll find her
at Wilshire Grand Hotel.

328
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,676
Welcome to the Wilshire Grand Hotel.

329
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,919
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

330
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,594
She's over there,
second from the end.

331
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,629
Bridget?

332
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,274
I got your name from
a good friend of mine.

333
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,630
Come back later.
I'm really busy right now.

334
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,870
His name's Fuller.

335
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,599
The manager's very tough on us.
You'll have to wait till I'm off duty.

336
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,877
I really don't think
I can wait that long.

337
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,472
Go talk to Ashton over at the bar.

338
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,030
Bridget, do we have
your attention now?

339
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,391
Thank you. Let's go.

340
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,476
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ashton.

341
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,159
Right there.

342
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,920
Ashton, some guy wants you.

343
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,469
You're a lucky man.
I just opened.

344
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,230
Oh, my. Something wrong?

345
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,516
Bridget just sent me over here.

346
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,472
What can I do you for?

347
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,120
You know a gentleman
named Hannon Fuller?

348
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,716
Gin martini up, one olive and
likes them frigid as an Eskimo.

349
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
- Talk to him recently?
- Why?

350
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,394
I'm his friend.
He didn't come home last night...

351
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,632
...and his wife is concerned.
My name is Douglas Hall.

352
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,592
Concerned wives?

353
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,798
I can't help you with that.

354
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,798
How about something fancy?

355
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,878
So did...

356
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,475
Does Fuller come here frequently?

357
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,908
You could say that.

358
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,109
What does he do?

359
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,238
What everybody does:
drinks, dances, has a good time.

360
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,476
Especially has a good time.

361
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,636
He really goes for the girls.

362
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,595
Girls?

363
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,593
Thought you said you knew him.

364
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,157
Yeah, I thought I did.

365
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,312
Are you in a hurry or something?

366
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,269
Did you happen to talk to Fuller
the night before last?

367
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,116
Yes, I did.

368
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,991
Did he mention my name?
Did he give you something for me?

369
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,310
What would that be?

370
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,114
- A message or a note, maybe.
- No, sorry.

371
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,629
Did you see him talking
to anybody else?

372
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,034
I'm a very busy man.

373
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,036
Listen...

374
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,872
...if you like, I can arrange
something for you too.

375
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,715
You see anything you want?

376
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,799
Can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

377
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,600
<i>Timer engaged and counting.</i>

378
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,835
Douglas Hall! Hey, man!

379
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,673
You all right?

380
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,793
You sure?
All right, take it easy.

381
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,398
Hey, man. Take it easy.

382
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,758
I told you, 120 minutes.

383
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,919
It's too long.
You're really pushing your luck.

384
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,993
I need something to drink.
Some water.

385
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,277
Mr. Hall, you forgot
your coat and hat.

386
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,997
Name's Ferguson.
Johnny Ferguson.

387
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,276
Anything wrong?

388
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,070
Didn't finish your drink.

389
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,634
- What happened?
- What happened?

390
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,190
The memory transference
with your link...

391
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,231
...it froze.
Started overlapping!

392
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,832
Thought I'd be shooting hoops
with Ferguson forever.

393
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,078
You got a smoke?

394
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,795
Sure.

395
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,874
Thank you.

396
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,115
Mind if I ask you a question?

397
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,871
Can you tell me where I am?

398
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,839
It works?

399
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,479
Oh, it works!

400
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,318
It works.

401
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,754
How about Ashton?

402
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,872
- My bartender?
- He's got a better haircut than you.

403
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,308
Much better.

404
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,916
I wish I could see it for myself.

405
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,508
How's the lighting? Textures?

406
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,315
Colorization needs work,
but the units don't notice.

407
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,356
What are they like?

408
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,669
They're as real as you and me.

409
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,310
You see, the old man was right!
All those years of work!

410
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,150
Did you find out
what he was doing there?

411
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,597
He was having sex with girls.

412
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,075
You're kidding me.

413
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,718
Excuse me, Mr. Hall?

414
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,434
A man in the lobby says
he needs to talk to you.

415
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,228
Thanks. Have him call
my office in the morning.

416
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,477
He says it's urgent.
That he's a friend of Fuller's.

417
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,676
So, you're a friend of Fuller's.

418
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,273
You're Hall, right?

419
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,708
How can I help you, Mr...

420
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,478
Tom Jones.

421
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,878
You know, like the singer.

422
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,990
How about some privacy?

423
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,516
What do you want to talk about?

424
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,355
About the night the old man died.

425
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,071
I'll be right back, Joe.

426
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,833
So where'd you meet Fuller?

427
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,758
In my bar the other night...

428
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,552
...waiting for you.

429
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,074
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

430
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,551
No, I want to talk about money now.

431
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,111
- Something in the seven figures.
- What money?

432
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,679
Come on.

433
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,069
You think you can
get away with it?

434
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,396
Get away with what?

435
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,675
You took the old man, asshole!

436
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,196
Listen to me.
He was at the bar.

437
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,597
You pick him up, leave together.
Next day he's an obit.

438
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,718
You do the math, asshole!

439
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,154
Oh, Jesus!

440
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,076
Crazy son of a bitch!

441
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,278
You're nuts.

442
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,989
I'll see you on
<i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

443
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,315
<i>Omni Hotel.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

444
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,592
Miss Jane Fuller, please.

445
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,317
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

446
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,515
On the night
your father was killed...

447
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,678
...he tried to reach me.

448
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,592
He wanted to meet at some bar.

449
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,108
What for?

450
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,276
He felt someone was after him.

451
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,078
Did you talk to him?

452
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,115
I know how strange this sounds.

453
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,389
I can't remember.

454
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,638
What do you mean?

455
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,480
Did you talk to
the detective about this?

456
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,073
No, but the bartender will...

457
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,672
...if I don't pay up.

458
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,629
Christ!

459
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,270
I know how crazy this sounds.

460
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,358
You can't just plug your brain
into this machine...

461
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,477
...and not expect
to be affected by it.

462
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,110
Please walk away from this
before you get hurt too.

463
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,395
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

464
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,112
Maybe we have, in another life.

465
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,799
What about Paris?
What's that other life like?

466
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,673
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

467
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,071
I guess I don't want you
to lose interest in me.

468
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,872
Don't worry about that.

469
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,516
Let's dance.

470
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,071
- Me? No, no.
- Yes, come on.

471
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,316
I buy all my shoes in left pairs.

472
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,949
It's easy.
I'll show you the steps.

473
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,116
You're doing pretty good
for a man with no right foot.

474
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,515
Must've picked it up in another life.

475
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,996
You know that feeling you have
that we met before?

476
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,149
It's the same with me.

477
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,549
Why is that?

478
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,877
They say that déjà vu
is usually a sign of...

479
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,671
...love at first sight.

480
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,718
Go, go. Ready!

481
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,793
Don't make any sudden moves.

482
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,073
What's this all about?

483
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,918
What it's usually all about.

484
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,669
Murder.

485
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,315
Is that your car?

486
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,676
- Those are my plates.
- No shit.

487
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,713
That's from a security camera
in your office garage...

488
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,593
...the night Fuller was killed.
- I don't understand.

489
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,472
That makes one of us.

490
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,716
Fuller wanted to shut down the project,
and you sliced him up.

491
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,273
It's time I call my attorney.

492
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,595
You say you left at 10.

493
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,791
I was working late with Whitney.

494
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,672
Anybody with you?

495
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,395
You're picking up bad habits
left and right.

496
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,317
Must be the stress.

497
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,152
Then you'll need a carton.

498
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,233
Name's Tom Jones. Said he saw
your picture in the paper.

499
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,473
Said you looked like the guy
Fuller left the bar with that night.

500
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,272
We took his statement.
Said we'd be in touch.

501
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,029
Somebody reached out
and touched him first.

502
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,438
Looks like you found an alibi.

503
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,559
You're free to go...

504
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,309
...for now.

505
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,789
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

506
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,315
The truth.

507
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,909
We met for a drink,
one thing led to another...

508
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,476
...we spent the night together.
Your picture was on the news.

509
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,319
He saw you and thought
you were good for quick cash.

510
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,034
You should've seen the pictures.
The guy was slaughtered.

511
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,708
He was an ex-con.
Who knows what else he did!

512
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,430
Just because I don't remember it
doesn't mean I didn't do it.

513
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,993
You're not a killer.

514
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,790
Your father stumbled onto something.

515
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,514
He left me a message
having something to do with this.

516
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,438
So what are you going to do?

517
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,519
Jack back in and find out.

518
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,991
<i>Downloading.</i>
<i>Time: Two hours.</i>

519
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,472
<i>Engage timer.</i>

520
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,874
<i>Timer not engaged. Warning!</i>

521
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,233
<i>Timer not engaged.</i>

522
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,630
<i>Warning.</i>

523
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,873
We're up next!

524
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,518
- Ready? Come on.
- What?!

525
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,670
What's wrong?

526
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,155
Come on, John!

527
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,629
What are you doing?

528
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,559
We're gonna be disqualified!

529
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,469
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot, chief.

530
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,069
Come on!

531
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,236
Grierson!

532
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,911
I'll call the police!

533
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,832
- I need to talk to you!
- I told you!

534
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,269
I'll call the police!

535
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,953
Listen. Listen!

536
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,515
I know why you pass out
from time to time.

537
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,718
I know why you wake up
and have no idea where you are.

538
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,713
What'd you do three nights ago?
Any idea?

539
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,192
<i>When did it first happen?</i>

540
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,594
First time?

541
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,074
About four weeks ago.

542
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,915
And the last episode
was three nights ago?

543
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,271
It lasts for about two hours?

544
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,680
My wife thinks
I have a secret love life.

545
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,876
What about...

546
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,838
...memory flashes, déjà vu?

547
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,234
I was in World War I.

548
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,512
I'm still having these nightmares.

549
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,312
I'm talking about fantasies.

550
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,910
I do have them.

551
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,228
In these fantasies,
you're having sex with young girls.

552
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,678
When I wake up...

553
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,672
...I even have a perfume smell...

554
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,196
...all over me.
- Real or imagined?

555
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,871
According to my wife...

556
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,198
...it's pretty real.

557
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,508
I found this...

558
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,671
...a couple of days ago.

559
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,796
Your size?

560
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,477
I am married over 35 years now.

561
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,039
And not once have I cheated on my wife.

562
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,673
Not once.

563
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,198
Let's have a drink.

564
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,077
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Timer not engaged.</i>

565
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,275
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Timer not engaged.</i>

566
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,072
You been here before?

567
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,076
I can't afford places like this.

568
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,473
My treat.

569
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,314
Good evening, Mr. Fuller.

570
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,748
That's you.

571
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,473
Good evening.

572
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,713
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

573
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,709
Members only.

574
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,912
- Mr. Fuller, your usual table?
- Of course.

575
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,071
He's with me.

576
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,471
May I help you with that?

577
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,676
Hi, honey bear.
I'll be with you in five minutes.

578
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,077
Let's talk, "honey bear."

579
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,675
You remember her?

580
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,832
Of course not.
She's mistaken me for someone else.

581
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,075
Your martini.

582
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,759
For someone else.

583
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,838
I want you to look around
and tell me what you remember.

584
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,189
I don't know.

585
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,073
I'd rather go home.
I don't feel very well.

586
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,597
You have the feeling
you've been here before?

587
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,471
Please try to remember.

588
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,352
Do you recognize anybody?

589
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,709
I'm trying.

590
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,153
Her?
What's her name?

591
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,839
I think her name...

592
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,839
Erika, I believe.
I believe her name is Erika.

593
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,029
Did you talk to her?

594
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,116
I'm not sure.

595
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,709
And that one looks familiar too.

596
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,951
Bridget.
Her name's Bridget!

597
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,749
Bridget. Oh, yes.

598
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,910
I remember Bridget.

599
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,310
Did you give her
something to give me?

600
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,790
Did you give her
a letter or a note?

601
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,312
The man behind the bar...

602
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,029
You're right.

603
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,232
I wrote a letter,
and I gave it to him.

604
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,629
To him!

605
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,474
You looking for
anything special?

606
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,516
What are you?

607
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,872
My name's Ferguson.

608
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,756
I'm a bank teller.

609
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,672
I'm Clark Gable.

610
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,516
I talked to the Ferguson guy.

611
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,948
He doesn't know a thing.

612
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,559
I need to talk to Fuller.

613
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,277
- He's upstairs.
- Cut the crap!

614
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,917
You think I don't know what's going on?
I need to talk to him again.

615
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,155
You read the letter.

616
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,872
I need to know what's in it.

617
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,673
Everything.

618
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,990
When I read it,
I thought it was a gag.

619
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,952
The world's a sham.
Fat chance!

620
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,596
But I'm not stupid, Mr. Hall.

621
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,515
I watched you and Ferguson
do the old switcheroo.

622
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,479
That stuff about going to
"the ends of the earth."

623
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,509
What stuff?

624
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,274
I did exactly
what the letter said.

625
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,317
I chose a place I'd never go to.

626
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,357
<i>I tried to drive to Tucson.</i>

627
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,073
<i>I figured, what the hell.</i>

628
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,475
<i>Never been to the countryside.</i>

629
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,349
<i>And I took that car</i>
<i>out on the highway.</i>

630
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,869
<i>I was going over 50</i>
<i>through that desert.</i>

631
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,719
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>I was the only car on the road.</i>

632
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,520
<i>It was just me,</i>
<i>the heat and the dust.</i>

633
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,671
<i>I did exactly</i>
<i>what the letter said:</i>

634
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,475
<i>"Don't follow any road signs</i>
<i>and don't stop for anything.</i>

635
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,272
<i>Not even barricades."</i>

636
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,115
<i>But just when I should've been</i>
<i>getting closer to the city...</i>

637
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,669
<i>...something wasn't right.</i>

638
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,076
<i>There was no movement, no life.</i>

639
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,749
<i>Everything was still and quiet.</i>

640
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,069
<i>And then I got out of the car.</i>

641
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,672
<i>And what I saw...</i>

642
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,039
<i>...scared me to the depths...</i>

643
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,071
...of my miserable soul.

644
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,514
It was true.
It was all a sham.

645
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,914
It ain't real.

646
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,152
Why would Fuller write about...

647
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,033
...the limitations of the simulation?
I know them.

648
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,679
I'm asking the questions!

649
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,397
I wanna know why.

650
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,669
Why would you put us through this?

651
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,112
Why are you fucking
with our minds?

652
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,039
- You weren't supposed to find out.
- Well, I did.

653
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,710
Now I want you to show me...

654
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,678
...what is real.

655
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,229
Is this real?

656
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,871
Is that real blood?

657
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,471
You like having
your life fucked with?

658
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,953
What the hell's going on?

659
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,993
Come on! Come on!

660
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,278
Where's the letter?

661
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,631
Snap out of it!

662
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,911
Not gonna hit me again, are you?

663
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,270
Did you yank me back?

664
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,114
Yeah, barely, man.
Just barely.

665
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,914
You didn't start the timer.
It couldn't engage.

666
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,390
What were you doing this
alone for anyway?

667
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,715
He tried to kill me.

668
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,359
- Who?
- Ashton.

669
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,990
Jesus!

670
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,110
He found out his world isn't real.
This is a mistake.

671
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,354
This whole project,
this experiment.

672
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,630
We are screwing with people's lives!

673
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,159
Now you're talking crazy.

674
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,033
I know you just had
a bad fucking trip...

675
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,593
"Bad fucking trip"?

676
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,153
"Bad fucking trip"?

677
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,552
These people are real.
They are as real as you and me.

678
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,359
Yeah, that's because...

679
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,710
...we designed them that way.

680
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,957
In the end, they're just
a bunch of electronic circuits.

681
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,395
Here's something else.

682
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,799
I'm shutting this
"bad fucking trip" right down.

683
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,276
- I'm telling everybody tomorrow.
- You can't do that.

684
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,950
You can't do that.

685
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,720
You're talking about
six years of our lives.

686
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,796
All of us.

687
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,470
You can't just
pull the plug and go home!

688
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,676
I'm looking for Jane Fuller.

689
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,318
Sorry, she's no longer with us.

690
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,635
The lady vanished.

691
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,871
Any idea where to?

692
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,752
- Why would I?
- Hannon Fuller doesn't have a daughter.

693
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,310
I think I made the age-old mistake:

694
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,875
"Never trust a beautiful woman."

695
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,078
Who is she, then?

696
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,753
We don't know.

697
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,270
It took us a couple of days
to contact the French authorities.

698
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,030
Guess what?

699
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,676
They never heard of her, either.

700
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,673
Do you remember me?

701
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,319
Miss Fuller checked out.

702
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,233
Did you drive her anywhere?
I'm looking for her.

703
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,675
No can do.
Company rules.

704
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,118
I'm Douglas Hall.
I'm looking for a young woman...

705
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,072
...named Jane Fuller.

706
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,275
I think you picked the wrong house.

707
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,269
Maybe she's going under another name.
She's about 5'8".

708
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,279
Blonde hair.

709
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,671
What do you want from her?

710
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,920
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Natasha Molinaro.

711
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,076
Over there on register four.

712
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,116
Here you go. Thank you.

713
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,272
$7.01.

714
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,872
Just slide it through.

715
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,789
You want cash back?

716
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,954
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

717
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,835
Must be déjà vu or something.

718
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,029
Paper or plastic?

719
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,675
Plastic.

720
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,273
There you go.

721
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,554
Mr. Hall!

722
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,958
You forgot your credit card.

723
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,315
Thanks.

724
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,913
No problem.

725
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,194
Sorry about staring at you in there.
You must get that a lot.

726
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,474
Yeah, but mostly from
the wrong kinds of guys.

727
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,393
You're not from here, are you?

728
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,871
What makes you ask?

729
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,115
Well, it's just...

730
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,152
I just had this funny feeling
that we met before.

731
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,871
Maybe in another life.

732
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,793
Yeah, I guess that would explain it.

733
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,276
Anyway, I gotta get back
to my daily grind, so...

734
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,870
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.

735
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,759
$7.28.

736
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,719
Out of 10. Here's your change.
Thank you very much.

737
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,468
Thank you.

738
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,999
<i>Natasha Molinaro...</i>

739
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,519
...27, single.

740
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,990
Changes jobs like
others change underwear.

741
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,235
<i>Comes from Austin, Texas.</i>
<i>Made some money modeling.</i>

742
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,112
<i>Left school without a degree.</i>

743
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,875
<i>Her roommate has no idea</i>
<i>what she was doing yesterday.</i>

744
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,038
<i>Looks like Molinaro</i>
<i>doesn't have an alibi.</i>

745
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,798
What else did the roommate say?

746
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,560
Says lately, Natasha
hasn't been feeling well.

747
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,394
She's been having
some sort of amnesia attacks.

748
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,669
<i>Going out all night,</i>
<i>sleeping all day.</i>

749
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,032
<i>Thought she was using drugs.</i>

750
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,151
She have a history of drugs?

751
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,713
Nope. She's clean.

752
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,714
Hey, Bernie?

753
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,874
- Good work.
- <i>Thanks, Chief.</i>

754
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,074
Look, I can explain.
I'm sorry.

755
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,315
<i>I need to see you.</i>
<i>Meet me in Fuller's office.</i>

756
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,078
I know the truth.

757
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,273
<i>Where are you?</i>

758
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,869
You could call it
the end of the world.

759
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,632
How many simulated worlds
like this are there?

760
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,319
Thousands.

761
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,474
Yours is the only one that ever created
a simulation within the simulation.

762
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,318
Something we never expected.

763
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,272
So you had to kill Fuller.

764
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,080
No. I was sent in after his death.

765
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,357
I was to pretend to be his daughter,
inherit the company...

766
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,869
...and shut it down.
But he tricked us.

767
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,632
He changed his will.

768
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,076
If you didn't kill Fuller...

769
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,634
...who did?

770
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,278
I stabbed him.

771
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,478
But it wasn't you.

772
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,672
It was your user.
He downloaded into you.

773
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,833
- Manipulated you.
- Like a puppet.

774
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,553
A puppet doesn't have a soul.

775
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,716
I can't have a soul
any more than Fuller.

776
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,955
But you do.

777
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,672
Fuller did.

778
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,759
I never expected that.

779
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,111
We programmed this world so no one
in it could learn the truth.

780
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,754
And you and Fuller did.

781
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,790
Don't you see what that means?

782
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,677
There's just one little flaw
in your thesis.

783
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,037
None of this is real.

784
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,871
You pull the plug...

785
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,073
...I disappear.

786
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,271
And nothing I ever say...

787
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,071
...nothing I ever do...

788
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,230
...will ever matter.

789
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,478
Why don't you find my user?

790
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,274
I'm sure he's a much better catch.

791
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,596
I told you about my other life.

792
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,953
I was referring to my husband.

793
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,878
He's your user.

794
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,112
He killed Fuller.

795
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,471
I'm his program link.

796
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,148
A reflection
of his character profile.

797
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,476
I fell in love with a decent man.

798
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,877
But he...
Something happened to him.

799
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,399
He began to use the simulation
as his own personal playground.

800
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,153
Like Fuller with the girls.

801
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,669
He made himself a god,
and it corrupted him.

802
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,480
He began to enjoy the killings.

803
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,675
- He became abusive.
- What do you mean?

804
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,957
He said he would kill me.

805
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,473
Why?

806
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,317
I fell in love with you.

807
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,030
You don't even know me.

808
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,839
Yes, I do.

809
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,953
From the moment the simulation
was created, I've watched you.

810
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,714
Your kindness...

811
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,593
...your integrity.

812
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,398
I fell in love with you
before I even met you.

813
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,032
How can you love me?

814
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,876
I'm not even real.

815
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,069
You can't fall in love with a dream.

816
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,717
You're more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

Shit!

Oh, wow!

825
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,878
Nice driving.

826
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,069
There was something in the road...

827
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,636
...and I had to swerve
and I lost control.

828
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,679
You drunk?

829
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,276
I don't drink.

830
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,034
License and registration.

831
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,036
Look, I didn't jack in...
I left it at home.

832
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,276
Why don't you look in the glove box?

833
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,439
Need a light?

834
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,275
Hey, I got it.

835
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,914
Here you go.

836
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,837
You ought to get this car looked at.

837
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,474
It's leaking oil.
That could be dangerous.

838
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,076
Be a little more careful, huh?

839
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,037
You want to turn off the car
and step out, please?

840
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,629
Turn off the car, sir.
Right now, please.

841
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,476
Open the trunk, please, sir.

842
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,870
Hands in the air.
Step away from the trunk.

843
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,111
Shit, man, it's Douglas!

844
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,469
Back up!

845
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,678
I said, back the hell up!

846
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,035
Hey, this is a joke!

847
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,756
Watch out!

848
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,797
Sorry to bother you...

849
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,154
<i>...but Mr. Whitney's</i>
<i>in the building...</i>

850
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,430
<i>...and he's acting kind of strange.</i>

851
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,596
I'll be right down.

852
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,910
<i>Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

853
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,872
This is Jane Fuller.

854
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,274
I need to speak
with Detective McBain.

855
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,270
<i>You've got a lot of explaining to do.</i>

856
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,357
<i>Or should I say, "Miss Molinaro"?</i>

857
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,870
How you doing?

858
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,674
All these pictures,
this is your world?

859
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,635
Ashton.

860
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,674
I never imagined
it could be so beautiful.

861
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,676
How'd you do it?

862
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,115
Last thing I remember,
I was dumping Ferguson in the trunk.

863
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,758
Son of a bitch!

864
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,079
He did it.

865
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,872
He jacked in.

866
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,873
Who's Jack?

867
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,876
What'd you do to the world?

868
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,718
- Turned it off.
- Well, put it back!

869
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,756
Don't do that!

870
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,474
Put it back!
What did I do?

871
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,111
Where are you?

872
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,110
Look at this.

873
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,359
You are really a god.

874
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,871
No, Ashton, I'm not really a god.

875
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,872
I'm just like you.

876
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,319
Just a bunch of electricity.

877
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,676
What are you talking about?

878
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,313
It's all smoke and mirrors.

879
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,076
Just like your world.

880
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,638
We're nothing but a simulation
on some computer.

881
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,472
It's like a machine.

882
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,918
Like this arcade game.

883
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,072
You've got your players
and you put your nickel in.

884
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,308
This one pitches...

885
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,473
...this one runs around the bases.

886
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,958
You got a bat, you got a ball.

887
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,957
They play, they score.

888
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,630
Preprogrammed movements
generated by electrical energy.

889
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,149
We've improved
on this model since then.

890
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,949
Now the players can beat
the shit out of...

891
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,277
...and try to drown one another,
which is always fun.

892
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,478
But the letter said...

893
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,877
Everything was fake?
The letter was meant for me.

894
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,952
Fuller was talking about my world.

895
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,878
So what are you saying?

896
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,274
You're saying there's another world
on top of this one?

897
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,114
That's right.

898
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,199
- I don't understand.
- Fuller found out about it.

899
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,556
They killed him.

900
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,673
Why didn't they kill you?

901
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,872
Maybe they will.

902
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,999
Maybe that's why
you're pointing a gun at me.

903
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,478
I'm sorry, Ashton.

904
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,309
We're stuck here.

905
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,278
You and me...

906
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,073
...and the rest of us.

907
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,871
I want to see it.

908
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,798
- See what?
- My arcade game.

909
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,636
It's breathing.

910
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,869
So this is where I was born.

911
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,276
And this is where you die.

912
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,515
What are you doing?

913
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,079
Watching you dream.

914
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,471
How much longer do you have?

915
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,273
Ten minutes.

916
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,920
Hi, honey, I'm home.

917
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,277
Did you miss me?

918
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:24,956
David.

919
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,354
When did you download?

920
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,512
Obviously, not soon enough.

921
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,308
I was just doing my job.

922
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,150
Sure you were.

923
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,071
He's shutting down
the system, isn't he?

924
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,878
Aside from his devilish good looks...

925
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,274
...what's so special about this guy?

926
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,553
He reminds me of you.

927
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,474
- The way you used to be.
- I'm still the same.

928
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,073
No, you're not.

929
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,069
Why did you butcher those people?

930
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,108
Because it was fun.

931
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,478
You've lost your mind.

932
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,869
You're the one who's fucking sick!

933
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,913
Falling in love
with a fucking simulation.

934
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,117
I was just having some fun.

935
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,673
Just like you did.

936
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,033
I think you're lying.
Just remember, he's a part of me.

937
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,195
That's not true.

938
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,234
It's okay.

939
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,755
Just pretend you're fucking him.

940
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:18,870
Why?

941
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,632
I guess I'm just jealous.

942
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,635
You okay?

943
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,876
What the hell took you so long?

944
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,996
How'd you know he'd try to kill you?

945
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,874
I knew when he was
planning to download.

946
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,955
He's dead?

947
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,839
A bullet will do that to you.

948
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,669
So, is somebody gonna unplug me now?

949
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,471
Do me a favor, will you?

950
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,428
When you get back to
wherever you come from...

951
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,108
...just leave us alone
down here, okay?

952
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,598
"June 21st, 2024."

953
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,279
Where am I?

954
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,191
Come, I'll show you.

955
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,478
Jane, we're getting hungry!

956
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,673
Tell Virginia we're waiting for lunch.

957
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,075
My father.

958
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,039
Fuller was modeled after him.

959
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:52,072
There's so many things
I have to tell you about, Doug.

960
