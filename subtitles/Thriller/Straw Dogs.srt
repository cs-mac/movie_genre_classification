1
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,100
- Is that for us?
- No, it's for you.

2
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
- What is that?
- A mantrap.

3
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
They used to use it
for catching poachers.

4
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello, Amy.

5
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
- Hello, Charlie.
- Where do we put it, Mr. Sumner?

6
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,600
- Oh. Here in the back.
- Oh, it's heavy, Mr. Sumner.

7
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

8
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Where do we put it, Amy?

9
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,600
Anywhere you want.
It's your birthday present.

10
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,300
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
- Don't scratch it.
- Why are you surprised?

12
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,200
- How long has it been, Charlie?
- Three summer holidays in six years.

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
David, this is an old
friend of mine, Charlie Venner.
My husband, David Sumner.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,300
- Mr. Venner.
- Please call me Charlie.
You work around here?

15
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Sometimes.

16
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
- Will you give me a hand, please?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,300
- David's a mathematician.
- What are you going to catch?

18
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,000
- Peace and quiet.
- Oh, an arithmetic teacher.

19
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,500
- Well, uh--
- No.
He's writing a book...

20
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,300
on the computer analysis
of the celestial--

21
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Good try. Here, why don't you
put this in the trunk, Amy.
Let me.

22
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,900
Maybe, um, Charlie could
help us with the garage, David.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, that's a good idea.
This fellow Norman, uh--

24
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,000
- Scutt.
- Yes.

25
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,700
- He's, uh, taking forever.
- Me and Bobby'll do it
for you, Mr. Sumner.

26
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,100
Me and my cousin Bertie will be out
tomorrow. We'll get it up for you.
Yes? How much?

27
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,700
- Oh, reasonable.
- Okay, thank you.

28
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,000
- We're at--
- Back at Trencher's farm.
We'll be there, sir.

29
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,200
Good. Good.

30
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Where are you going?

31
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
David?

32
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,900
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

33
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay.

34
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,800
Uh, a couple of packs of
any American cigarettes, please.
Time, gentlemen, please.

35
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,600
Finish your drinkin', gentlemen.
Let me have your glasses.

36
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,700
Henry Niles.

37
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,300
I thought he was to be put away.

38
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Oh, we can take care
of our own here. Usually do.

39
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,100
Remember when
I took care of you, Amy?

40
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,300
But you didn't.
Remember?

41
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,900
There was once a time,
Mrs. Sumner...

42
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,400
when you were ready
to beg me for it.

43
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Take your hands off me.

44
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Come on, gentlemen. Drink up.
Let me have your glasses, please.
Bloody early, Harry.

45
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Harry...

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,900
I think I should have another pint.

47
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,000
Sorry about my uncle, Harry.
I think he's a bit taken with drink.

48
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh.

49
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,400
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Harry Ware.

50
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,700
- I'll pay for
the American gentlemen's cigarettes.
- Oh, no, that's okay, I--

51
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
That's all right.
I got it, sir.

52
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
Garage coming along?

53
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Norman fixing it up all right?
Yeah.

54
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,400
And I'll pay for the glass.

55
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,200
And I'll even pay for the little bit of
plaster to put on your bleedin' finger.

56
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,500
But I do think I should have
another pint to take me home.

57
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
The bar's closed, Tom.

58
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,000
- Come on, Tom.
- Oh.

59
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,700
It is, is it?

60
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,100
We'll see about that.!

61
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,600
- Take it easy, old man!
- Old man, you say?

62
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
All right, Tom.

63
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
You've had your fun.

64
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,500
Pay the man and leave.

65
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,600
Ah.

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Oh.

67
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,100
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Magistrate.

68
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,100
But what I am, I am.

69
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
What's the damage, Harry?

70
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,300
Call it a quid, Tom.
Let's call it, uh...

71
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,300
30 bob.

72
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Will that do then, eh, Major?

73
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Go home, Tom, will you...

74
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
or you'll be up before me
on a fresh charge.

75
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,200
Come on, lads.
Work to be done.

76
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,200
- See you tonight, Harry.
- All right, Tom.

77
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I showed him, eh, lads?

78
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
Uh, they're paid for, sir.

79
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,700
They are now.

80
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,200
- Stupid cow!
- Get off!.

81
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,000
What was that about?

82
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Who was that big guy
with the beard?

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Why?

84
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Is he any relation
to your friend Charlie?

85
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Yes.

86
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,700
How well do you know
this fellow Venner?

87
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop teasing.

88
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,500
- Did you ever go out with him?
-Stop.

89
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
- Hmm?
- Leave me alone! Stop it!

90
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,500
Stop.

91
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
- Tell me.
- I'll stop the car.

92
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,800
I just want to know.
Tell me.

93
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Stop. I'm telling you.

94
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
- You asked for it.
- Okay.

95
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,200
All right, drive the car-- Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

96
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,200
You asked for it!
Chicken!

97
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,000
- You're nuts!
- You're terrible! You're wicked!
Oh, by the way--

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,300
- Yeah?
- Venner did try to get fresh once.
Yeah? So?

99
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,900
Nothing happened.!
- Ba-bum

100
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Ba-ba-bah-bum
Ba-ba, ba-bum

101
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Hi.

102
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
You'll have some help tomorrow.

103
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Charles Venner and his cousin
are coming to help finish the garage.

104
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
We'll have the garage finished
before Chris gets the rats out.

105
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,400
- Hello, miss.
- Chris?

106
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Yeah, Chris.

107
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,100
Oh,yes. Mr. Cawsey.
The rat man.

108
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,700
- Want help with this, sir?
- Yes.

109
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,900
It's a real antique, sir.

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,300
- Rare, they are.
- My wife is a collector.

111
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,300
But I end up with them.

112
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I find it's a bit large
for my prey, sir.

113
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
- Won't do at all.
- Don't count on it.

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
- Do you like it here, sir?
- Very much.

115
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,700
- I hear it's pretty rough
in the States, sir.
Have you seen some of it, sir?

116
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Bombin', riotin', snipin',
shootin' the blacks?
Can't walk down the streets, they say.

117
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Was you involved in it, sir?
I mean, did you take part?
See anybody get knifed?

118
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,900
Just between commercials.

119
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
Wanna put that down there?

120
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,100
No, I'm just glad I'm here
where it's, uh, quiet...

121
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,400
and you can breathe fresh air
and drink water that doesn't
have to come out of a bottle.

122
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,600
It isn't water that I drink
out of a bottle, sir.

123
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,900
Those two fellows will be up
to help you tomorrow.

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Kitty.!

125
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,300
- You gonna have a crack at her, Norman?
- No.

126
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,800
Ten months inside
is enough for me.

127
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,700
- They got anything worth taking?
- Nope.

128
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Except, uh...

129
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,900
these.

130
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,200
- You bloody fool.
- It was nothing.
She's got a dozen or more.

131
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Full of perfume.

132
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
You like my trophy?

133
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,000
Bugger your trophy.

134
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,500
I want what was in 'em.

135
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I could do with
some of that too, Normie.

136
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,700
Charlie Venner.

137
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
He had some of it years ago...

138
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,300
when she was here with her father.
Venner's a bloody liar...

139
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,300
and so are you.

140
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,200
Tell her, smell her
Lock her in the cellar

141
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,500
Kitty, kitty.
Where are you?

142
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Kitty.

143
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Kitty, kitty.

144
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,900
Kitty, kitty.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,500
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

146
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Want a drink?

147
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
I can't find the cat.

148
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,300
Doesn't answer my call.

149
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
Do I?

150
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,000
You'd better.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Why did you hire
Charlie Venner?

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
I didn't. You did.

153
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Kitty.

154
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,100
If she's in my study,
I'll kill her.

155
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
What?

156
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Nothing.

157
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
That your daddy's chair?

158
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Every chair is my daddy's chair.

159
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm glad we came.

160
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,600
- What are you doing?
- Kiss me.
Mmm.

161
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,100
- You're an animal.
- Mm-mmm.

162
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Why'd you take my heater
out of the study?

163
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Because it's going upstairs.

164
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
What happened?

165
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
It's not going upstairs.

166
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,500
It's freezing in there.

167
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,100
Hello.

168
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,500
I can see you're working at top speed.
Is he in there studying?

169
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,100
You'd better do something.

170
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,000
- My husband will think
all Englishmen are lazy.
- Let me help.

171
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,800
Hey!

172
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah, come on over here. This way.

173
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,100
Watch your fingers, Chris.

174
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
What was so funny with them?

175
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,700
They just think
you're strange.

176
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,800
Why, because I'm American?

177
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
Mmm, no. No.

178
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,800
Just strange.

179
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Do you think I'm strange?

180
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
Occasionally.

181
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
You act like you're 1 4.

182
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I am.

183
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,500
Wanna try for 1 2?

184
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,500
How about eight?
I freak out for eight-year-olds.

185
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
- David?
- Huh?

186
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Will you please
get some lettuce?

187
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
Okay.

188
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
Oh, and fix
the damned toaster.

189
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,500
What does she think
I'm doing here, playing games?

190
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,500
What is this,
grammar school?
Jesus Christ.

191
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,400
Uh, we're leavin' now,
Mr. Sumner.

192
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,300
- Mr. Riddaway be givin' us a lift.
- Fine.

193
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh, I was just sayin'
to your missus...

194
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,000
that in a funny sort of way I feel
closer to rats than I do to people.

195
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Even though I kill 'em for a living.
Their dying is my living.

196
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,300
Smell a rat, see a rat, kill a rat.
That's me, Chris Cawsey.

197
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,800
I'd be lost without 'em.
It's true. I tell you straight.

198
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,400
Cleverest thing you ever see
around these parts is a rat.
Rats is life!

199
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,600
Shove up,
you overgrown bastard.

200
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,100
How's your day been?
Been up in a fat sheep, have ya?

201
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, you fluffy fleecy darlings

202
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,700
You with the dark brown eyes
David?

203
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
David.!

204
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,600
Dinner's ready.!

205
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Did you hear me?

206
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,900
- Hello, Major.
- Evening, Major.

207
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,300
- Evening.
- Will you be having a pint
with me then, Major?

208
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
Not tonight.
I'll buy my own.

209
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Otherwise
we'd never get out of here.
You know that.

210
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
Yes, I do know that.

211
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Thanks, Harry.

212
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
Excellent.

213
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,300
-John.
- Evening, sir.

214
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,500
- Fancy a game?
- Aye.

215
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,800
- Evening, Harry.
- Evening.

216
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,400
John Niles, come here to me.

217
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
- Is this for a drink, Tom?
- No, this is for the truth.

218
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,700
Your brother.

219
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,700
Been hangin' around
the girls again.

220
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,700
You'd better keep a closer watch,
or we'll be puttin' him away.

221
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
It's all right, Pa.

222
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,600
He's only throwing the ball
to 'em a little.

223
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,500
A little's too much
for that sod.
Watch your tongue, Norman.

224
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
I'll watch nothin'
except my own ways.

225
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,300
You watch your brother,
or I'll do it for you.

226
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,200
If he ever makes
a mistake again in any way...

227
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,200
I'll be the first
to have him put away.

228
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
David.! You've been at it for hours.!

229
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,800
Aah!

230
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,400
- Gave me a fright, you did.
- You watching him, are you?
Just lookin'.

231
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
Do you fancy him?

232
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
He's sweet, I think.

233
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
Want anything?

234
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Want a tomato?

235
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,200
No, thanks.

236
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,800
Want a grapefruit?

237
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
- Hey, hey.
- Your move.

238
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Okay.

239
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Check.

240
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,200
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

241
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,800
"This move now...

242
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,300
"puts black into
a desperate plight...

243
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,500
"with no possibility of mobilizing
his disorganized pieces.

244
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
"Therefore, he begins
to return material...

245
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,100
"to make progress
in developing at any price.

246
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Two pawns down,
white can conveniently--"

247
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,300
Hey, I bet I can undress,
do my exercises and get into bed
before you make your next move.

248
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,500
- Is it a deal?
- You're on.

249
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,200
- Ah! No cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

250
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Shh, David.

251
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Aha! I have it.

252
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,000
No, no, no, David,
just a minute.

253
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,000
You're supposed to do a hundred.

254
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,700
I did a hundred. I counted
by binary numbers. Make your move.

255
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
- Binary numbers.
- Make your move.

256
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,800
- Wait a minute.
- Come on.

257
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,800
- What about that one there?
- No.

258
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,200
- Uh--
- It's difficult, isn't it?

259
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,200
Terribly.

260
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,100
Just a minute.

261
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
I think I have it.

262
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,300
Um--

263
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,600
Ooh.

264
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,700
That puts you in.

265
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,800
-Jesus!
- What are you doing?

266
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,800
I gotta get my watch off.
You're an animal.

267
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Oh, for Christ's sake.

268
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm just setting the alarm.

269
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,800
Are you finished?

270
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. What now?

271
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
David.

272
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,500
David, what are you
doing down there?

273
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,900
- Looking for a chess piece.
- What are you doing?

274
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Take a look.

275
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,600
- Whoa. Did you find it?
- No, not that.

276
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,600
Wait a minute.
Let me give you a hand.

277
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,900
Aah.!

278
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
David, no.!

279
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
- No, wait! Wait a minute!
- You see it? Huh?

280
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,400
- No, I didn't find it.
- I think it's a rook.
No.! Aah.! No.!

281
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,300
Mmm.! I love you.!

282
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
I never cheat.

283
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,700
Look, Amy,
don't play games with me.

284
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,100
I've got a lot on my mind.
You're not being fair.
I'm just trying to help.

285
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,400
If you want to help,
then get your friends to finish.

286
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,400
Get the garage makers and the
rat catchers-- Get them all to finish!

287
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,800
- Oh.
- A-And fix the toilet
and clean up the kitchen.

288
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,200
That would be a terrific help!

289
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,900
I love you, Amy,
but I want you to leave me alone.

290
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,900
Okay.

291
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll leave you alone
with your blackboard.

292
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Don't play games with me.

293
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,600
No.

294
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,100
Don't do it, Amy.

295
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,300
They were practically licking my body.

296
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,500
Who was practically
licking your body?

297
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Venner and Scutt.

298
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,400
I congratulate them on their taste.

299
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,900
Damn rat catcher staring at me.

300
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Why don't you wear a bra?

301
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,600
Why should I?

302
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,100
You shouldn't go around without one
and not expect that type to stare.

303
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
Look...

304
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,900
if you could hammer a nail, Venner
and Scutt wouldn't be out there.

305
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,900
Listen, Amy, uh...

306
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,900
fixing the toaster
and getting the garage built...

307
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,700
is not exactly the reason
I came here in the first place.

308
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,900
Are you saying
you'd be happier if we hadn't left?

309
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,900
We left because
I got a grant to do work...

310
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,500
which I haven't found
the time to do.

311
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
You left because...

312
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,700
you didn't want
to take a stand, commit.

313
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,900
Commit to what?

314
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Huh?

315
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,200
I was involved with my work.

316
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,600
You want something out of me
that is not right to deliver.
That's not what I was there for.

317
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,900
But I know why you're here.

318
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,300
Why?

319
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,800
Could it be because there's
no place else to hide?

320
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
I'm here because you once said...

321
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,200
y-you thought
we could be happier here.

322
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Remember?

323
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm sorry.

324
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,300
Are you sorry sorry,
or just sorry?

325
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,200
Sorry sorry.

326
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,700
Then come here.

327
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,800
I'm gonna take a bath.

328
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,800
Why?
You don't need one.

329
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,800
I think I do.

330
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Hey.

331
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,800
By the way, I never claimed to be
one of the, uh, "involved."

332
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,400
Don't forget
to draw the curtains.!

333
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

334
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,900
Thinking?

335
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
Mm-hmm.

336
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,600
- Don't want to come
for a walk, do you?
- Sure.

337
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,700
When?

338
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,700
In a little while.

339
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on.

340
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,300
Hello.

341
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Good evening.

342
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Kitty.! Kitty.!

343
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Kitty, kitty.

344
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,400
David, I can't find the cat.!

345
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,900
Can you forget the cat
and let me work for a minute!

346
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,400
Kitty.!

347
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,700
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

348
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Kitty.!

349
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,800
Kitty.!

350
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,300
Kitty? Kitty, kitty?

351
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,000
" Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty."

352
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,600
- Shit.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

353
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,100
Other side, sir.

354
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,100
Hang on. Hang on.

355
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,400
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait for him for a minute.

356
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,000
Where be the blackbird

357
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,500
Oh!

358
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,700
- Hey, let him pass!
Let's see how good he is!

359
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Whoo!

360
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,400
You're out of your mind.!

361
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,000
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello,Janice.

362
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,000
Henry! Come here!

363
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,300
Oh, he's all right.
Aren't you, Henry?

364
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,500
Henry, how many times
I gotta tell you, boy?

365
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,500
You don't listen.

366
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Come on.

367
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,700
Come on, Henry.
We're going home.

368
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,000
What do you want?

369
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:52,600
You'd have known for sure what
she was after 20 years ago, eh, Tom?
Now, now, that'll do.

370
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,100
- They still down at the hall bingoin'?
- Yeah.

371
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,000
Tell her I'm behavin' meself.
I'll be along soon.
Bobby.!

372
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Run along now.

373
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,600
- Hello, David.
- Hi.

374
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,300
Bobby!

375
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,300
Take care of your sister, mind.

376
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,300
I will, Dad.

377
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,300
- Bye, Mr. Sumner.
- Good-bye.

378
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,500
I'd like a scotch, double...

379
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,800
with ice.

380
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Cheers.

381
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Evening, Major.

382
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,200
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

383
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,800
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

384
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,500
- Mr. Sumner?
- Yes?

385
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,600
I was about to call up to your farm to
welcome you into our little community.

386
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
I've just been welcomed.

387
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,400
-I'm John Scott.
- Hello.

388
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,900
I saw your car outside. I thought
perhaps we could drive up together.

389
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,100
I wanted to have
the good Reverend and Mrs. Hood...

390
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,300
talk you into joining us at the
church social this coming Thursday.

391
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,400
The vicar will run me home.

392
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,200
Can I buy you a drink, Major,
before you go?

393
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,000
No, thank you, Tom.
We're in a hurry.

394
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Buy 'em all one.

395
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,200
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, Major.
Watch out for sheep.!

396
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,200
- You got your
Wellington boots on, Major?

397
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,200
Now, some men
goes for women

398
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,200
And some men
goes for boys

399
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,200
But my love's
warm and beautiful

400
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,500
And makes
a baa-in' noise

401
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Amy, nice to see you.

402
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,700
- Major, why haven't you
been out to see us before?
- Shearing time. My apologies.

403
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
- I see you brought
my drunken husband home.
- Come on, I'm not drunk yet.

404
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,500
Certainly not my fault.
- Hi. I'm David Sumner.
- I just brought him home.

405
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
- Barny Hood.
- Reverend.

406
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,500
- My wife.
- Mrs. Hood.

407
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,500
- Hello.
- Well, well. Please sit down.

408
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
- Barny. Louise.
- Hello, Major.

409
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,800
What are you drinking, Reverend?

410
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,800
Scotch.

411
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,300
The reverend and his wife...

412
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,300
came to invite us to a party
at the church hall next week, David.
Oh.

413
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,700
Well, it's, uh, going to be more than
an invitation, Reverend, isn't it?

414
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,400
Major, you gave away
our secret plan.

415
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
- Who said anything about money?
- I was thinking of about five--

416
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll take it.
Thank you very much.

417
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,100
And I expect to see you both
at the social and at the church...

418
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
when you can spare the time.

419
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,800
Time is a little difficult to find
these days. Uh, so are cats.

420
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,700
By the way, Amy, did you find
your, uh, kitty, kitty, kitty?

421
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,700
No.

422
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,700
At least give us some hope
about your coming to church.

423
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,400
- Yes. After all, hope is your business,
Barny, isn't it?
- Yes, and faith.

424
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,800
And charity.

425
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
- Thanks.
- Amy's been telling us
why you came to Wakely.

426
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,800
- To write, to meditate.
- Why did you come?

427
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,000
I was drafted.

428
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,700
- Well, tell us what you do.
- Okay.

429
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm a, uh,
astral mathematician.

430
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,300
Oh. Never heard of it.

431
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,200
That's because I just made it up.

432
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,900
I'll get you another drink.
I have a grant to study, uh...

433
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,900
possible structures
in stellar interiors...

434
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,800
and the implications regarding
their radiation characteristics.

435
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,100
-Am I boring anyone?
- Radiation-- That's
an unfortunate dispensation.

436
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,300
It surely is.
Yes, indeed.

437
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,600
As long as it's not
another bomb.

438
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,600
You're a scientist.
Can you deny the responsibility?
Can you?

439
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,700
After all, there's never been
a kingdom given to so much bloodshed...
as that of Christ.

440
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
- That's Montesquieu, isn't it?
- Oh, really?

441
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,300
Who's he?

442
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Somebody well worth reading.

443
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,500
We'd better leave
these good people.

444
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,800
Yes, well, you won't let me
walk home, will you, Barny?

445
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,100
Mrs. Hood,
you're very lovely.

446
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,600
- I'll get your coat.
- Does God bore you, Amy?

447
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,600
In the areas of boredom, Mrs. Hood,
God is not my problem.

448
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,600
- Your wife tells me you play
an interesting game of chess.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

449
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,800
You were... awful
to the reverend.

450
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,200
No, no, no, no.
I wasn't.

451
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,900
He's all right.
I like him.

452
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

453
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,200
His wife is very attractive.

454
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,600
Oh.

455
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,100
Yes, she is, isn't she?

456
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,400
- Here, I think I--
I think you need some help.

457
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,100
- David.
- Hmm?

458
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,900
What's a binary number?

459
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,800
Uh, zeroes or ones...

460
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,800
plus or minus.

461
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,900
In sequences of twos.

462
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,000
Hey, that's right.

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,900
You're a bright lady.

464
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,700
You're not so dumb.

465
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,900
Sometimes I need help.

466
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
When?

467
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,600
Like, um, now, maybe.

468
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,400
You got it.

469
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,000
What's the matter?

470
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,600
Scutt or Cawsey.

471
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,300
I've locked all the doors
and windows downstairs.

472
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,100
Let's keep them locked
from now on. All right?
Great.

473
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,900
Did you hear me?

474
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,900
What?

475
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Scutt or Cawsey.

476
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,700
- Why?
- To prove to you they could
get into your bedroom.

477
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,200
I don't believe that.

478
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,700
Well, who else
is around all the time?

479
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,700
Amy, uh...

480
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,200
we've left all...
the doors unlocked.

481
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,000
I mean, it could have
been anybody passing.
"Anybody passing"?

482
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
David, a complete stranger
comes into our house...

483
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,600
and decides to strangle our cat
and hang her in the wardrobe?
Somebody passing?

484
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Cawsey or Scutt.

485
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,200
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

486
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,600
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

487
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Lousy way to make a livin', though.

488
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,100
You gonna look at them all day?

489
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,800
Would you feel better
if I went out and talked to them?

490
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,500
Not necessarily.
Perhaps we could just pack up and leave.

491
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,900
Nobody's leaving.

492
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,800
Why? Because we paid for a year?

493
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,200
Look, Amy,
I'm not going to...

494
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,300
just go out there
and blatantly accuse them.

495
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,700
You don't have to accuse them.

496
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,700
You could start by mentioning that our
cat was strangled and see what happens.

497
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:14,000
You can believe in the possibility,
can't you?
Okay. Okay.

498
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,500
I'll go out and mention to them
that the cat is missing...

499
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,400
and I'll ask them
if they've seen her.

500
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,400
All right,
let's see what it's good for.

501
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,200
- You don't think that's enough, do you?
- Not quite.

502
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,900
Perhaps you'd like to write them
a note on your blackboard.

503
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Well, I thought he might enjoy it.

504
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,700
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

505
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,700
- How's it, uh, going up there?
- It's all right, sir.
Yeah. Want a smoke?

506
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,400
I like the smell of those
American cigarettes, Mr. Sumner.

507
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,200
Can you give me a hand with that
mantrap? Just wanna get it in the house.

508
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,500
Uh, right through here.

509
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,900
Right here by the fireplace.

510
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,900
Thanks.

511
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,300
Amy, listen.
I'm gonna catch them off guard.

512
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,300
- When?
- Right now.

513
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,000
Open or closed, Mr. Sumner?

514
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Uh, gee, I don't know.

515
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,900
Uh, open it.

516
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,900
If you can.

517
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
Sorry, Charlie.

518
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
Bite, sir.

519
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I can appreciate that.

520
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
Be careful.

521
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,600
Watch that hand
on the spring.
Pretty dangerous thing, sir.

522
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,900
- This is the, uh, safety lock, sir.
- Right.

523
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,600
Where would you like it, sir?
Uh, put it right over
the fireplace there.

524
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,700
You fellows like some beer?

525
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,700
- Very nice.
- Oh, very welcome.

526
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,400
Thank you.

527
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Cheers.

528
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Uh, cheers, miss.

529
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,700
Cheers.

530
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,500
- Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?

531
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,500
Would you like to
shoot with us sometime?

532
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,300
Oh, I've, uh--
I never hunted much.

533
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, but you've, uh,
shot, Mr. Sumner?

534
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,900
Just once or twice,
but that was--

535
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,200
Be easy then.
You should try it, sir.

536
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,200
Living here at Trencher's, with good
shootin'outside the door. Eh, Norman?

537
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,400
Right. Right, sir.

538
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,700
When?

539
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,800
How about tomorrow, sir?

540
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,800
Okay. Thank you.

541
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,200
That m-- That might be... fun.
I'd like that.

542
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,700
Thank you.

543
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
What about the garage?

544
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,900
It can wait.

545
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,700
We'll meet at Wakely
at about half past 8:00.

546
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,900
- You know the pub?
- Yes, I do.

547
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,700
Well, we'd better
get back to work, sir.
Thank you for putting that up.

548
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,200
That's all right, sir.

549
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,400
Oh, I, uh,
I don't have a gun.
But, uh--

550
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,000
will this do?

551
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Ah.

552
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,400
There'll be plenty extra, sir.

553
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,100
Good.

554
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,100
- Thank you for the drink, sir.
- Thank you.

555
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,900
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the drink, sir.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

556
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,500
Break it, Mr. Sumner.

557
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,100
- Why? It's not loaded.
- Break it.

558
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,700
Now you're sure.

559
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,400
Uh, this'll be you
right over here, Mr. Sumner.

560
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,400
Right.

561
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,000
Now, here's your sack.

562
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,000
We'll beat the ducks
right to ya.

563
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,100
- Small, they are.
- Yeah.

564
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,700
We don't want it broken up
with shot unless you have to.

565
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,000
But, uh, if--
if you can't catch 'em...

566
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,000
shoot 'em.

567
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,700
They might come
right down here, sir.

568
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,500
- Or they might come
from behind as well, sir.
- But I don't move?

569
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,100
Stay as still
as you can be, sir.

570
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,600
Now, we'll be spread about.
If you need us,just call.

571
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,300
You do that.
Here's your sack, Norman.

572
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,900
- You drive 'em to me, Charlie.
- I will.

573
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,100
Uh, good luck, sir.

574
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,800
Might be a little while, sir.

575
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,600
I'll be here.

576
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,800
Who is it?

577
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,800
Is David all right?

578
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,600
He's fine.
Enjoying himself.

579
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,100
May I come in?

580
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,100
All right.

581
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,500
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

582
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,800
Would you like me to go?
I will, you know.

583
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,100
No.

584
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Stay and have your drink.

585
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,200
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

586
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,000
I'd like to know
what you think of cats.

587
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,800
I do fancy cats.

588
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,900
Please leave me.

589
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
No.

590
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,600
Get out!

591
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,400
Don't tease me, Amy.

592
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,400
Please.

593
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,000
Aah! Aah!

594
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,100
No!

595
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,000
Aah!

596
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,100
No.

597
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,200
Please, Charlie.

598
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
Amy.

599
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,700
I don't want to reave you, but I will.

600
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,300
No.

601
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,700
No. No.

602
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,300
No! No!

603
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,200
No!

604
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,300
No!

605
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,800
No.

606
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,200
Amy!

607
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,100
N-No.

608
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,100
Easy.

609
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,800
I'm sorry, Amy.

610
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,900
I'm sorry.

611
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,900
Hold me.

612
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,500
Hold me.

613
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,300
No.

614
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,400
No.! No.! No.!

615
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,900
Why didn't you open the closet?

616
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,200
We don't have any more cats.

617
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,700
I'm firing Venner
and Scutt tomorrow.

618
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Hooray for you, tiger.

619
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,200
What for?

620
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Because they stuck it to me
on the moor today.

621
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,500
They also serve
who sit at home and wait.

622
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,300
What?

623
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,900
Nothing. If you'd have said
something to them ages ago...

624
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,400
-about the cat, this would
never have happened.
- Easy.

625
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,500
- None of it.
- Easy, easy.

626
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,900
I was going to say something
until you pulled that childish stunt...

627
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,800
and ruined any chance
I had of finding out.

628
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
- David, I didn't--
- I didn't finish.

629
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,900
- You pushed me, and you don't do
any good by pushing.
- I didn't.

630
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,300
When are you ever gonna
learn about growing up, huh?

631
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,500
I'm trying to.

632
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,700
Well, you're a little late.

633
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,100
Why didn't you ask him
instead of making me look like
an idiot with that bowl of milk?

634
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,600
You're a coward.

635
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,200
- No, I'm not.
-And I'm a coward.

636
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,200
Plain and simple.

637
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,500
No, I'm not.

638
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,500
I don't blame you
for hiding in your study.

639
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,500
I don't--

640
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,200
I don't want to
hide there with you.

641
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,900
I-- I can't anymore.

642
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Okay.

643
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,200
Easy, easy, easy.

644
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,100
- You're fired, all of you.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

645
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,700
I've noted the hours
that you've worked...

646
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,500
and I've deducted...
the-the time wasted.

647
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,000
- Here. It's all here.
- Why, sir? Why are we fired?

648
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,400
We may not work the way
you like to work, sir--

649
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,400
- Listen to me.
- Sir, I mean, why?

650
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,100
You're fired because I don't want you
around. I want you to leave. Right now.

651
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,100
- Is that clear?
- We've been working all the time, sir.
Clear enough, sir.

652
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
- Norman.
- Huh?

653
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's a nice way
to treat people.

654
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,300
We're due at the church hall at 8:00.

655
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,600
I'd like you
to meet Amy and David Sumner.

656
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,900
- Hello. Nice to meet you. My husband.
- Hello, Mr. Sumner.

657
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,200
Hello, Amy.
Nice of you to come.
I'll show you to your seats.

658
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,100
Hello, Reverend.
How have you been?

659
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
- Please sit here.
- Thank you.

660
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,400
- I think she'll be able
to see okay from here.
- That's fine.

661
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,400
Would you care for a drink?

662
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,000
All right. Thank you.

663
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,700
I hope you enjoy the show.

664
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,400
Thank you.

665
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,900
Be brave.

666
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,900
Evening, ladies and gentlemen...

667
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,300
and welcome to our
annual social gathering.

668
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,700
It's nice to see again
all the old familiar faces.

669
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
And the not-so-old,
indeed, as well.

670
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,500
To begin the evening, we have
our very own Reverend Barnard Hood.

671
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,000
Your vicar,
ladies and gentlemen.

672
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,300
Thank you very much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for my famous newspaper trick.

673
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:15,200
Tore it up last year, Barny!
Yes, and I might well
next year, too, Tom.

674
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,100
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen--
a very simple trick.

675
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,100
I simply tear a piece
of newspaper down the center so.

676
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,900
Tear it again.
Fold it towards me.

677
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,300
Music, please.

678
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,100
Open it up very carefully.
Tear it again.

679
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,300
There we are.
Roll it towards me again.

680
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,600
- You enjoy this, Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes, Vicar.

681
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,900
It is a good trick, isn't it? I do it
in front of the mirror every night.

682
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,300
And we begin to open up.

683
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,100
- I always enjoy doing this.
It gives me a chance to...
- Hello, David.

684
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,600
catch up with my reading.
Hi.

685
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,800
You want a smoke?

686
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:02,100
And I find that
it hasn't been torn at all.

687
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,000
- No.
- What?
- Don't smoke in here.

688
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,700
And you'll also find that
that one isn't torn either.

689
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,700
Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.

690
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,300
But I think
you'll probably find that...
it hasn't been torn at all.

691
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,700
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello.

692
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,500
I'd like to go for a walk.

693
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:36,000
- Will you take my arm?
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...
for my piece de resistance...

694
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,700
I now present to you an empty glass.

695
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,200
I am now going to fill
this glass with milk.

696
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,000
Would it work better
with whiskey, vicar?

697
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,300
- Nothing works better with whiskey.
- I do.

698
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,100
You've never worked
in your life, Tom.

699
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:58,500
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take the lid off my cocoa tin.

700
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,800
And very carefully now,
I place the glass...

701
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,400
into the tin
and replace the lid.

702
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,100
I take up my wand
and I utter the magic words--

703
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,000
What do we find in the tin...

704
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,500
but one complete...

705
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,500
glass of milk.

706
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,700
- Yea.!
- Good old Barny!

707
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,600
If I could convert you
to this, Tom, that would be a miracle.

708
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,700
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Major.

709
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,900
The next item on this evening's
program, ladies and gentlemen...

710
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,400
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

711
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,700
...who will sing for you the aria
Caranome from the opera Rigoletto.

712
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,500
Dad?
It's Janice.

713
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,800
She made off to the yard.
Then she went walking with Henry Niles.

714
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:40,200
He was holding her, Dad.
Touching her.
John Niles.

715
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,100
What's the matter, Tom?

716
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,800
Come with me.

717
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,400
All over her, he was.
Touching her.

718
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,200
Had his hands all over her.

719
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,800
Don't be afraid, Henry.

720
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,800
- I'll find him.
- No.

721
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,900
Let the boys find Janice.
The rest can wait.

722
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:35,500
Have you ever kissed
anyone, Henry?
No.

723
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,000
Get your mates to find her. I'll be
waiting in the pub. Get all of them!

724
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,400
Would you like to kiss me?

725
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,500
Go on. Find him!

726
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,200
Would you now all please stand?

727
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:23,500
As these lights are
extinguished in our eyes...

728
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,500
and also in the presence of God,
the Blessed Virgin...

729
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,900
and all the saints--

730
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,200
Deliver unto the devil
a punishment with eternal fire.

731
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,900
Dwell without him...

732
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,100
unless ye repent.

733
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,900
-Janice?
-Janice.!

734
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,000
- Amen.
- Amen.

735
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
- I have to go.
- No. No, they might hurt you.

736
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,900
-Janice.!
- Come here.!

737
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:12,100
- Where are you,Janice?
- Henry.!

738
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,300
Janice.!

739
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,700
We don't know where she is.
We looked the whole town!

740
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,700
- Keep looking.
- The fog's coming down.

741
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,100
Did you try the lorries and such,
parked outside the meeting house?

742
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,300
- Then do it!
- I'll go with him, Pa.

743
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,200
-Janice?
-Janice.!

744
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,000
Janice.!

745
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,300
We're almost home now.

746
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,500
Can I help?

747
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
David!

748
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,200
Jesus! I couldn't stop.

749
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,600
- Oh, God, David.!
- Easy.

750
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,700
Okay. Get the keys.

751
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,000
Easy. Easy.

752
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,300
David,you know it's Henry Niles?

753
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,300
I don't want him here.

754
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,100
He's hurt.

755
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,300
I don't want him in my house.

756
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,600
Fine. You get upstairs.
You go to bed.

757
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,600
Take a bath.
You just get out of here.

758
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,900
He'll stay until the doctor comes.

759
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,300
What do you mean,
you don't want him in your house?

760
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,300
- David, did you get anyone?
- No.!

761
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,200
I tried the doctor. He's not home,
and the consul's not either.

762
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:30,600
Nobody answers.
I'm calling the pub.

763
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,700
- Wakely Arms.
- Hello, this is David Sumner.

764
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,700
No. No, he ain't.

765
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,800
Oh. Well, when he comes in,
tell him to call Trencher's Farm.

766
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,200
I've got Henry Niles here.

767
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,300
Right.

768
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:05,600
It was the American,
looking for Allsopp.
He hit Henry Niles with his car.

769
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,000
He's got him up at Trencher's.

770
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,100
Bottle.

771
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,100
And another.

772
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,000
Let Norman and me go in, Tom.

773
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
We know the American.

774
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
- I want to know where myJanice is.
- We'll find out, Tom.

775
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,700
Riddaway will stay with you, Tom.

776
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,300
That I will.

777
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,700
- You have Henry Niles in there?
- Wait a minute. Is the doctor with you?

778
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,900
- We want to see Niles.
- Why? What's the matter?

779
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,300
Wake up!

780
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,300
- Wake up!
- Don't try to kid us
you're sleeping. Come on.!

781
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,000
- Hey, wait a minute, now.
- Come on! Come on!

782
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,300
He's hurt.
He could have a broken rib.
Oh. Sorry, sir.

783
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,100
He'll have more than a broken rib if he
doesn't tell us whereJanice Hedden is.

784
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,100
- What aboutJanice Hedden?
- Took her, he did.

785
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,300
What have you done with Janice Hedden,
you dirty pervert?

786
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,200
Lookee here. He played
his filthy tricks on Janice Hedden.

787
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,500
He took her, and he was seen
with his hands on her body.

788
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,800
She run, he run after her,
and now she's missing.

789
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,000
- Look, I understand your concern--
- You--

790
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,700
Don't touch him!
Don't do that.

791
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,500
Don't lay your hands on me!

792
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,800
It's none of your business,
and it never has been.

793
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
That's fine.

794
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,700
But you can't hit him.

795
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,600
Listen, Mr. Sumner...

796
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,600
we come to get
this bloody freak.

797
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,700
And we're gonna get him...

798
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,700
with your cooperation or without it.

799
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,800
David, stop it.!

800
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,000
Hey, listen.

801
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:55,100
Listen, Henry, did you see
Janice Hedden tonight?

802
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,300
Of course he did. Ain't you listenin'
to me? He did his dirty numbers on her.

803
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,800
Just take it easy.
Henry, listen to me.

804
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:07,300
Did you takeJanice Hedden out
of the meeting house tonight? Huh?

805
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,400
Listen to me. Please.

806
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,400
Gentlemen, he's helpless.
Look at him. He couldn't hurt a fly.

807
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:22,300
You'd be better off looking for
Janice Hedden than standing around here.
You know?

808
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,800
All right. We go find Janice,
you go find the doctor.

809
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
I'm not leaving him here
with my wife.

810
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,300
- Thought you said he was helpless.
- Yeah.

811
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,000
You wouldn't leave him alone with your
wife or your kid, if you had one.

812
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,100
Oh, that's different, huh?

813
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,600
Look-- Look, fella.

814
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,700
He's staying here with me until
the doctor and the police arrive.

815
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,000
- He's my responsibility.
- Your responsibility?

816
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,700
- That's right.
- Why?

817
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,000
This is my house.

818
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:10,500
Okay, come on.

819
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,600
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

820
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,200
The police'll be here soon.

821
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,300
What did the bastard say?

822
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,300
Didn't talk.

823
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,400
Well, why didn't you make him?
That's what you went in there for!

824
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:57,800
-Uh, David--
-Why don't you just go make some coffee?

825
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,200
I want that Niles.!
I'm goin'in.

826
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,200
- Please, David. Stop them.
- Don't worry.

827
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,700
Solid. They can't break in.

828
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,800
I know how they feel.

829
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,400
I'd feel the same way if it was
my kid that was missing.

830
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,900
Amy, go to bed, huh? Go on.

831
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I can handle this.

832
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,300
You give me that Niles!

833
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,800
Hey! Hey, cut it out!

834
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,500
Listen to me. If you don't stop now,
so help me God I'll press charges!

835
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:15,800
Okay, you've had your fun.

836
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,200
I'll give you one more chance.

837
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:23,000
And if you don't clear out now,
there'll be real trouble. I mean it.

838
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,900
- Chris.!
- Come on. They're gonna cooperate now.

839
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,800
Just go on upstairs.
Don't worry.

840
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,400
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna fix the window.

841
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:54,000
- Do you think we ought to
clear off, Norman?
- Why?

842
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,500
We'll get that Niles.
I tell you we will.

843
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,400
Well, why stop then?

844
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,300
He's got no right to live,
an animal like that.

845
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,500
Tom, I'll run 'round,
I'll slip in the window...

846
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:13,600
and get that Niles out
quick as a flash.
Uh, the rest of you, kick up a row.

847
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,400
Hey.!

848
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,300
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

849
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,000
It's that snipe
we're after, Mr. Sumner.

850
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,600
- I said stay down!
- I want the lavvy.

851
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Come on.

852
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,200
Look, you stupid Yank.

853
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,200
Let's have Niles
before someone gets hurt!

854
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,600
Come on. Up you go.

855
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:50,400
I've had to put up
with a lot in my time.
You can't leave him in there.

856
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,100
But I draw the line at this place.

857
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,700
No.!

858
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,800
I'll have an answer,
or I'll have blood!

859
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,900
Where are you going?

860
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,900
Give Niles to them.
That's what they want.

861
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,000
They just want him.

862
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,700
Give them Niles, David!

863
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,500
- They'll beat him to death.
- I don't care.

864
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,700
You send him out,
or your whole house will be--
Get him out!

865
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,300
You really don't care, do you?

866
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,700
No, I don't.

867
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,500
Cawsey.!

868
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,100
Come here.!

869
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,700
There's more whiskey
in the lorry.!

870
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,600
No. I care.

871
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:03,000
This is where I live.

872
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
This is me.

873
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,300
I will not allow violence
against this house.

874
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,700
Don't worry.

875
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,300
Go on upstairs.

876
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:24,900
- Beautiful.!
- Please don't leave me.
Just do as you're told.

877
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,600
Get out of there!

878
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:38,000
David? It's me, Major Scott.

879
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:48,400
- Come on.
- Thank you.

880
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,900
I see you finally got
through the enemy lines.

881
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:55,100
Don't worry about that.
I'll tell them to clear off.
Sorry I didn't get here earlier.

882
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:00,500
Yeah, I am too.
They're breaking all my windows.
David,Janice Hedden is missing.

883
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,900
Tom is out of his mind with worry.
They're drunk out there.

884
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,600
I know that,
but you're the law here.
Oh, where can he be

885
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:19,000
I don'tjust kill 'em,
you know. I breed 'em as well.
I'll deal with them.

886
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,300
- David!
- Lots more where they came from.

887
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,500
Well, Tom,you're being
a bit stupid, aren't you?

888
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,400
Chucking things through people's
windows. You ought to have more sense.

889
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,600
You tell him I want that Niles
or I'll come in and get him!

890
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:41,500
You give me that bloody gun and get
the hell out of here. That's an order.

891
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,500
What about myJanice?
It weren't one of yours.

892
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,600
- He took myJanice.
- Listen, Tom.

893
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,200
We don't want any trouble
here, do we?

894
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:58,200
There wouldn't have been any trouble
if you'd put Henry Niles away.

895
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,700
You wanted to put my Emma
away soon enough!

896
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,500
Damn you, Hedden.
Give me that gun.

897
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,600
Damn you, Major.
Let go!

898
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,900
- David!
- Bastards!

899
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,900
Bastards.!

900
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,300
You bastards!

901
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,000
David, phone! Phone anybody!

902
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,600
Please, phone somebody!
David!

903
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,000
Phone!

904
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,600
- No calls tonight.
- It's dead.

905
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,100
Get the lights. Go on.

906
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,800
I didn't reckon on nobody
gettin' killed, Norman.

907
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,100
Yeah, well, that's too bad.
We're all in it now.

908
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,500
- Accessories, we are.
- That's the law.

909
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,500
Henry Niles!

910
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,700
David, give them Niles.
That's what they want.

911
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,600
I'm gonna keep them
out of this house.

912
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,000
Please! Listen to me!

913
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,300
- Come on!
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.

914
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,000
I can hold them off. Don't worry.
Someone will show up.

915
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,100
- David!
- Cut it out!

916
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,400
Like Major Scott?

917
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,800
David, how are you
gonna keep them out?

918
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,800
- I can keep them out.
- How? There are five men out there.

919
01:35:55,900 --> 01:36:00,200
- I know that.
- They have a gun!

920
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,600
I know they have.

921
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:08,500
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
- Goddamn you, David!

922
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,300
- If you don't give them Niles, I will!
- Oh, no, you don't.

923
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:20,000
We're gonna blast your windows.!
This is my affair.
The lights.

924
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,100
Go upstairs and turn on
all the lights.

925
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:28,000
They won't be able to see me,
but I'll be able to see them. Go ahead.
No.

926
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,500
No, I won't.

927
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,500
Go.

928
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,000
Goddamn you! Move!

929
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,100
Move!

930
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,500
Yee-hee-hee-hoo!

931
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,500
Oh, he's running it
into the glass house.!

932
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,300
Norman.!

933
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,700
Charlie.! In the glass house.!

934
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,500
What are you gonna do on your own?

935
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,900
Do we have any rope? Huh?

936
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,900
I'm talking to you.
Do we have any rope?

937
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,000
No.

938
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,200
I suggest...

939
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,400
you get out of the way
of the windows.

940
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:16,400
I also suggest that you turn
the rest of the lights on upstairs.

941
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,900
- Do we have any wire?
- I told you, I won't help you.
I see.

942
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:26,000
Why don't you entertain Niles?

943
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,500
Norman! Chris!

944
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,000
Who is it?

945
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:12,600
Where are ya?

946
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,600
- Yaa-ha!

947
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,500
Oh, I fell!

948
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:21,700
You're damned right, ya jerk!
I'll wrap this bike
'round your neck!

949
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,100
- See ya at the bottom!
- Yee!

950
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:38,300
Let me in the door.!
I want Niles.!

951
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,100
David, they're everywhere.
What are we gonna do?

952
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:46,600
- David! Aah!
- Amy.

953
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,300
Amy. Amy.

954
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,100
Open the door,
and let's have Niles.

955
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,100
I won't let them hurt you.

956
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,100
Please, love.

957
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,700
Wait there.
I'm coming, Charlie.

958
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,100
Wait. Wait, Tom.

959
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,700
No, David!

960
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,800
Easy, Tom. Come on, Tom! Wait a minute.

961
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,900
Let me out, David!

962
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,500
David, I'm sick of it.

963
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:31,000
If you don't let them have
what they want, then I'm going.

964
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,000
Let me go.

965
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,100
Go. Go.

966
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,400
Go on.

967
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:57,100
No! Aah!

968
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,100
Stay there and do
as you're told.

969
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,200
If you don't,
I'll break your neck.

970
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,600
You've got more cartridges, Tom.
Enough for all of them.!

971
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,200
- It's just Niles.
- Listen--

972
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,900
He can't shoot
through that door.

973
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,900
Ya dirty Yank bastard.!

974
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,400
Listen to me.

975
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:29,500
You know what happens if they
get in now? They'll kill us all.

976
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:38,500
They've gone too far
to back down now.

977
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,600
You understand that?

978
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,000
We're dead if they get in.

979
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:48,800
Thank you, sweetheart. Stay.

980
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,800
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

981
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,100
- Cawsey, come here.!
- Where are ya?

982
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,600
- Can you get in?
- Yeah, I think so.

983
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:04,100
They'll be hiding from the gun.
Get in and slip along and open the door.

984
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,300
Hey. Make bloody sure
Tom don't fire at me.

985
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,400
He won't. I'll be there.

986
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,800
Mrs. Sumner, I've got
something for you here. Look.

987
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:16,800
Aah!

988
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,700
See him down there?

989
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,400
- Get out! Get out!
-Aah.! Hee hee.!

990
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,800
Let go.

991
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:41,000
Make one move, you son of a bitch,
and I'll slit your throat.

992
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:44,400
Give me your other hand.

993
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,400
Come on.

994
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:01,800
This wasn't any of my doing, sir.
It was Venner and Hedden.
Been after your wife,yes.

995
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:06,300
Am I hurting you, Mr. Scutt?
- My neck's on the glass.
- Good.

996
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:09,100
Hope you slit your throat.

997
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,300
Come out here.!

998
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,000
Amy, come here.

01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,000
Get me out ofhere.!

1000
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:28,100
Tom.!

1001
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,300
- Wait. Fine.
- Watch my head.

1002
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,200
Hold it still.
That's it.

1003
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,100
Get upstairs.

1004
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,400
There we are.

1005
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,600

Open the attic door. Come on.

01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,800
Come on.

1011
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,300
Tom!

1012
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,900
Open the door,
or I'll blow you to pieces.!

1013
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,100
- You bastard.
- Okay. Okay, take it easy.

1014
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,800
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1015
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,800
Open the door.!

1016
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,800
More water!

1017
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,900
Norman, Tom.! Come in here.!

1018
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:06,200
- I got him!
- It'll hold. Where's the pole?

1019
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:24,000
Go on. Yell out if you see them
come around the front.
Charlie, come over here.

1020
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:30,200
Here we go again.!

1021
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,800
Keep goin', Norman.!
Do it again.!

1022
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,700
Hee-hee.!

01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,100
- Tom!
- To your right a bit.

1024
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:47,300
Watch this one.

1025
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,300
He's playing music.

1026
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,900
- Give me the gun.
- Out of the way. I'm goin' in.

1027
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,900
Keep the gun pointed,
and he won't get near you.

1028
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,600
I've got ya, Tom!

1029
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,800
What's the matter, Tom?

1030
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,800
You're dead!
I'll kill ya!

1031
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:03,200
Don't come in.
You don't come in here.

Gun's empty.

1036
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,700
Is it, now?

1037
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,900
Why don't you pull it
and show me?

1038
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:36,400
I've got plenty of time,
Mr. Sumner.

1039
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:42,000
David, I need you.!

No.! No.!

1044
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,800
Take him downstairs, Charlie.

1045
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,900
You put him to sleep.

1046
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,500
I'll call you when I'm ready.

1047
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,400
Just do it, Charlie.

1048
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,800
No, Charlie!

1049
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,500
Jesus.

Amy--

1053
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:08,000
Use the gun, Amy.

1054
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,700
Okay. Okay?

1055
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:03,200
You okay?

1056
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,700
Hmm?

1057
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,400
I don't know my way home.

1058
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,900
It's okay.

1059
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,500
I don't either.
