1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,520
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,230
These are gps ankle monitors.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,170
Now, step up, take one and put it on.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,790
When the exchange is over,

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,750
You and I are gonna spend some quality Time.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,340
These aren't release papers.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,950
I did the best I could do.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,410
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,970
You want me to give up the one thing

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,620
That makes me valuable to the team.

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,340
Hey, you knew the deal when you came onboard.

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,610
Do you want to flush it down the toilet

13
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,890
Because you made a bad move?

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,600
This man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,880
I Don't recognize him.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,100
If you do see him, would you please give us a call?

17
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,730
You Don't work for the irs?

18
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,620
I Don't.

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,520
Who do you work for?

20
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
As of now... Myself.

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,540
I'm an associate of general Krantz.

22
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,950
The general, he likes his privacy.

23
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,490
I knew you were rotten from the beginning,

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,250
So I want you to walk me through this

25
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,990
And if you can't, I'm gonna call the authorities.

26
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,490
Cole Pfeiffer.

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,090
Who the hell are you?

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,600
The last Time

29
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,870
A pretty little filly like yourself

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,090
Knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,780
I had to pay for it.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,560
You still might.

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,340
That book was a gift

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,100
From a very dear friend of mine

35
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,410
Who left this realm all too soon.

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,440
The only thing that James Whistler ever gave anybody

37
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,530
Was the clap.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,910
You have 30 seconds to tell me something

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,460
That I Don't already know.

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,840
I followed that book from Panama city,

41
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,250
Where James Whistler and I were co-incarcerated,

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,890
To a bus locker in san diego.

43
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,780
Inside was information pertaining to this apartment...

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,530
Scylla.

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,170
How about that?

46
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,480
That ring a bell, huh? Huh?

47
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,690
What do you know about Scylla?

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,350
I know I'm holding the keys,

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,720
Because without me, that bird book's

50
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,000
About as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,310
I commandeered Whistler's alias.

52
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,570
I infiltrated his place of business

53
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,380
Because it's the Gateway to the whole damn thing.

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Where's the location?

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,660
What do you bring to the jamboree, darling, huh?

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,440
Aside from those baby blues

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,970
And a knife?

58
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,730
This is me.

59
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,940
This is Scylla.

60
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,340
This is you.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,130
I am gonna get Scylla.

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,630
And it can either be with you...

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,210
...Or through you.

64
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,390
So why Don't you give me

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,980
That informed decision right now,

66
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,200
Before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,610
'cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,730
How may I be of service?

69
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,750
This is unbelievable.

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,940
We were planning our move

71
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,290
On Scuderi when he chartered the flight. Right.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,910
And no chance you dragged your feet a little bit

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,610
Waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,060
Oh, yeah, we want to drag this out.

75
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah, well, location's pretty convenient, wouldn't you say, Linc?

76
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,080
Uh, Scuderi splitting town

77
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,340
Kind of caught us a break, huh?

78
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,730
Would you shut him up?

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,420
No, no.

80
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,960
We could just wait till he comes back.

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,500
Agrisow makes farm chemicals.

82
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,800
It's not fort knox.

83
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,710
You want to bet?

84
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,760
Their patents are worth billions.

85
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,100
Which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
On those patents.

87
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, we could breach their security,

88
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,280
In a week, minimum. We could get

89
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,920
In the guy's house-- week, minimum.

90
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,910
Or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
And have card five by midnight. How's that sound?

92
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,370
"how's that sound?" how does this sound?

93
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,610
If you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,140
Yeah, Don't I know it.

95
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,650
Let's talk outside.

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,270
So what's the plan?

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,450
We're going to vegas.

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,190
Oh, hell yes!

99
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Yo, I call shotgun!

100
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,220
Huh? Who's got-- hey.

101
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,230
Yeah!

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,330
So what do you want to talk about, agent Self?

103
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,730
I've been a part of hundreds

104
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,220
Of operations during my career--

105
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,360
And I'll tell you one thing.

106
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,270
I never been on the Top of someone else's hit list.

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
What are you talking about? What am I talking about?

108
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,570
If this Company hit man Wyatt

109
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,550
Can find me once, it's only a matter of Time

110
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,300
Until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.

111
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,470
Well, that's not true.

112
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,610
'cause you'll never see him coming at all

113
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,050
If he's coming after you. Yeah.

114
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,660
That's comforting. What do you think,

115
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,360
I want that?

116
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,130
You're dead, we're all back in jail.

117
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,260
You were an agent longer than me.

118
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,300
What's my play here?

119
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,250
Okay.

120
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,130
Let me get this straight. You turn your back

121
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,580
On me and now you want to know

122
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,110
My play? Really?! That was your fault.

123
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,380
What would you have Done?

124
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,770
I've tracked down rapists, killers,

125
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,760
Even former military,

126
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,730
But a structural engineer from illinois was able to get to me.

127
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,690
Want to know how?

128
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,790
Yeah, I want to know.

129
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,450
He stopped running.

130
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,720
He got aggressive.

131
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,480
He took the game to me.

132
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,500
That's your play.

133
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,220
That's your only play.

134
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,390
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent

135
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,260
Is a complicated matter-- even in our line of work.

136
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,790
Perhaps Mahone is just

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,110
The tip of the iceberg.

138
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,570
We've been searching for the link between

139
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,130
Supermax and Burrows and Scofield.

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,310
I believe we found it. If Scofield

141
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,160
And Burrows are working with the government,

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,940
We've got a much bigger problem

143
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,360
Than one bureaucrat at homeland security.

144
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,130
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

145
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,240
And if Don Self is the head of the snake...

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,240
Make it look like an accident.

147
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,700
My fee just doubled, by the way.

148
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,200
Hello?

149
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,050
Uh, hi, is this Brad?

150
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,300
Yeah.

151
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,100
Uh, you came by my office a couple of Days ago

152
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,290
Looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.

153
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,870
Right.

154
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,980
I know where he is.

155
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,000
She wants two grand first.

156
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,190
I'm meeting her at noon.

157
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Okay, the next card's more important, right?

158
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,650
So vegas first, then we deal with t-bag.

159
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,580
Shut up!

160
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll stay.

161
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,580
All right.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,210
Linc, take, uh,

163
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,640
Sara and Sucre...

164
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,680
...Roland to vegas.

165
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,150
The rest of us...

166
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,930
...Will handle

167
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,010
T-bag.

168
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,490
You heard the man, let's go.

169
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,380
Hey, um...

170
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,150
...Promise me something, would you?

171
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,310
Yeah.

172
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,850
Can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?

173
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,160
'cause I just think

174
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,880
That would make this whole thing worthwhile.

175
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,190
Be safe.

176
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,450
Ay, yo, vegas, bitches!

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,160
He should have the info by now.

178
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,770
Okay, what the hell's taking Bellick so long?

179
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,860
Yes.

180
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,470
She wants more money.

181
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,790
How much more?

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
I Don't know.

183
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,120
You got to come talk to this chick.

184
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,600
Hold on, hold on.

185
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,760
What's going on, Bellick?

186
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,090
Believe it.

187
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,060
Sorry, guys, I walked right into it, too.

188
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,420
It's okay. Go. Go! Come on, now!

189
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,450
Go!

190
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,320
You have no idea who you're working with, honey.

191
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,530
Why Don't we skip the theatrics

192
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,310
And you just tell us what you want.

193
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,030
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

194
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,940
Time's up.

195
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,580
Him, too.

196
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,780
Let's all get in the van.

197
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,870
Let's all get in the van now.

198
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,730
You, too, Mahone.

199
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,480
Mahone!

200
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,010
I remember the Day we met, pretty.

201
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,680
You were a scared little college boy

202
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,120
Sittin' up on those bleachers,

203
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,210
Now look at you.

205
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,230
Cold. Hard.

206
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,710
Like a dried up flower

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,980
Wanting to get watered.

208
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,170
Just tell me what you want.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,970
I want to make you bleed.

210
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,160
I want to release the sinner inside of me

211
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,790
That got me incarcerated so many years ago.

212
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
But it seems

213
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,530
You caught yourself a break, pretty.

214
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,050
I need you.

215
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,620
Now...

216
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,320
You gonna cooperate right quick or so help me

217
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,310
I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.

218
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,760
The pages-- look at them.

219
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Looks like some kind of map, right? I Don't know.

220
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,590
You know enough to chase me down

221
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,760
Looking for this.

222
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,480
Now Don't lie to me, pretty.

223
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,770
Whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.

224
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,310
What, like Scylla big?

225
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,230
This is not a game, Theodore.

226
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,700
Now, you need to tell me who you've been talking to.

227
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,250
I Don't need

228
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,200
To do a damn thing.

229
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,690
That's the benefit of being the man with the gun.

230
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,140
Now...

231
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,870
You're going to write down everything

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,420
You already know about Scylla,

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,180
And everything

234
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,760
You learn from that book...

235
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,020
...Or I'm going to paint these walls

236
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,750
With your Gray matter.

237
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,430
Get to work!

238
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,750
Hello.

239
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,570
All right. I'll be right there.

240
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,630
Self.

241
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,610
Hey. Michael's position

242
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,670
Hasn't changed since you called.

243
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,590
How do we know he...?

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,490
Bagwell's a psychopath,

245
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,010
But he's a psychopath with a plan.

246
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,700
He obviously needs something from Michael,

247
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,360
And as long as Michael doesn't give it to him,

248
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,320
He'll keep breathing.

249
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,490
All right. I'm coming with you.

250
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,770
No, no, no, no. I got it.

251
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,510
Stick to the plan.

252
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,180
Will you forget about Maricruz?

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,380
You think she didn't know

254
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,660
Her sister was trying to set you up, man?

255
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,070
You better get some ass in vegas, bro.

256
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,820
We're here to copy the card.

257
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,420
Then we leave. Got it?

258
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
Have you heard from Michael?

259
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,970
No. Why?

260
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,540
Nothing. I want this thing Done.

261
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,810
Vegas ain't my town.

262
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,130
What a fool, huh?

263
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,740
How could anyone not love this place, right?

264
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,580
Check this out. Right there.

265
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,490
The asian guy.

266
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,820
I know I've seen him someplace before.

267
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,290
So what do you have for me?

268
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,060
So what's "gate"?

269
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,710
Excuse me?

270
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,810
It's on that box.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,570
Why do you want to know? Just curious.

272
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,430
What if I was to tell you

273
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,010
I think you're just stalling?

274
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,130
Biding Time till you can figure out some macgyver way

275
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,240
To get your ass out of here, huh? I'd say you've got that gun

276
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,790
Pointed at the one person who can help you.

277
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,770
So why Don't you stop wasting my Time?

278
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,240
Please, Don't let him!

279
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,900
How 'bout her, huh?

280
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,140
How 'bout her, Michael?

281
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,010
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

282
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,240
Let's do a test.

283
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,960
No!

284
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,600
How far gone is Michael Scofield?

285
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,200
Michael, just tell him what he wants!

286
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,310
How far gone is Michael Scofield?!

287
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,340
Please, Don't let him. Please!

288
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,970
When did it happen, Michael?

289
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,900
Please, Don't let him...

290
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,110
When did you stop caring about hurting people, huh?

291
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,230
Fox river? Sona?

292
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,250
You gonna keep dragging

293
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,380
Your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?

294
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,830
Why Don't you put that gun down.

295
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,080
I'll put it down when you start writing down, pretty!

296
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,130
Let her go,T-Bag

297
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,840
T-Bag, hold it on, let her go

298
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,300
Last chance. Three!

299
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,530
Two! One...

300
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,030
All right! All right!

301
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,880
The pages, they fit together.

302
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,790
But it's not a map.

303
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,240
It's a blueprint.

304
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,620
For what?

305
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,800
Our friend, Bellick, is wearing

306
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,170
A government-issued ankle monitor.

307
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,420
My guess is that Scofield has one, too.

308
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,880
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,790
Any minute, federal agents could come

310
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,090
Blasting through that door.

311
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,570
So what do we do?

312
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,050
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.

313
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,970
Feel free to pitch in here, miss Daisy.

314
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,240
If Scofield knows I'm involved, this is over.

315
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,790
We need to keep him on point.

316
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,250
Now, get out there and get that information.

317
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,950
What about the agents?

318
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,870
Let 'em come.

319
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,550
How do we even know this guy's out gambling?

320
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,260
The guy's got $300,000 in credit and a comped room.

321
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,560
He's here. Keep looking.

322
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,850
Hey, Sara.

323
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,500
Hey, uh, I realize this might not be the best Time for this,

324
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,920
But I still haven't heard from Michael.

325
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,350
They must be dealing with t-bag.

326
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,010
Lincoln, come on. What?

327
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,000
Vegas just isn't your town?

328
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,580
From everything I've heard about you,

329
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,000
That would be a pretty big change of pace.

330
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,530
I guess so.

331
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,540
Lincoln, please talk to me.

332
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,350
Has Michael told you about mom?

333
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,190
No.

334
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,020
They were much alike.

335
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,670
They got the Same mind.

336
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,150
As mom got older, she started to Lose it.

337
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,820
We, uh, later found out

338
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,400
It was a symptom of a brain tumor, hama...

339
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,750
Hamartoma. Yeah.

340
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,450
As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

341
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,810
They stopped.

342
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,520
In her 30s, they started up again.

343
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,920
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

344
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,270
And you're telling me this, because Michael and his mother

345
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,950
Are similar in that way, too, right?

346
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,270
He got nosebleeds as a kid.

347
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,900
They stopped, and the last couple of Days

348
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,120
They started up again.

349
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,820
How old was your mom when she passed away?

350
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,060
Thirty-one.

351
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
Michael's just turned 31.

352
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,140
Yeah?

353
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,340
I found him.

354
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,660
Keep an eye on him.

355
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,290
Okay.

356
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,640
Andrew Blauner?

357
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,610
Uh, yeah.

358
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,420
Can I help you?

359
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,620
I hope so.

360
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,210
Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?

361
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,090
No.

362
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,060
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

363
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,860
No.

364
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,470
I'm giving you one more...

365
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,090
What is all this?

366
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,070
You okay?

367
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,520
They told me not to talk to you.

368
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,160
"they"? Who's they?

369
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,430
This is Whistler's blueprint.

370
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,550
It's the building where we can find Scylla.

371
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,010
In other words, it's Gate.

372
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,700
Where's Scylla?

373
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,430
I can't be certain until I see the building itself,

374
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,160
But I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here, below this office.

375
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,000
What is Scylla?

376
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,240
It's the Company's little Black book.

377
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,420
I want you to take me to Gate, now.

378
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,200
Because you can smell that Scylla money, can't you?

379
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,310
That's what you're in it for, just like me.

380
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,640
Say it.

381
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,770
Come on.

382
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,810
I want you to say it.

383
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,570
I'm in it for the money.

384
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,470
You see?

385
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,030
We ain't so different after all.

386
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,840
Yes?

387
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,930
Don Self is not at his house.

388
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,950
Looks like he cleared out.

389
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,570
Notify our people inside the bureau and lapd.

390
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,640
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.

391
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,480
Sir?

392
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,340
Not now.

393
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,060
Don Self is here to see you.

394
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,700
Got to warn you, friend, she's cold.

395
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,020
Good luck, pal.

396
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,040
Stay with him.

397
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,430
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.

398
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,390
Man works fast.

399
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,670
Says he can't get any further

400
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,800
Without seeing my former place of employment.

401
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,420
Did you take care of our little troll problem?

402
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,840
Don't even think about doing this to me.

403
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,110
My name's on the door.

404
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
If I didn't think you were valuable,

405
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,120
You'd be dead already.

406
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,120
Grab a leg

407
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,860
It's-it's just a little sensory overload, guys.

408
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,390
There just wasn't any room for the card.

409
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,780
Right. Because if we turn the device on

410
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,980
In the casino, it fills up on all the data from the slots.

411
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,250
Like when they're about to pay out.

412
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,710
Oh, it's completely unintentional. Really?

413
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah. It's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?

414
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,300
If we didn't need you...

415
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,670
But you do, so just take a brewski and chill, all right?

416
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,830
Okay, we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.

417
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,620
Yeah.

418
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,980
The old man just showed up at the pool.

419
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,070
From what he's wearing, there's no way

420
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,140
He's got the card on him.

421
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,200
Stay with him.

422
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,100
Card's in his room.

423
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,300
Tell me, Donald,

424
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,690
How did you play this moment out in your head?

425
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,360
Did you picture yourself coming in here,

426
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,530
Chest out, jaw squared,

427
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,290
Ready to demand answers?

428
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,650
Did you at any Time in your fantasy

429
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,440
Imagine that you would be this nervous?

430
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,390
Honestly, i, uh... I didn't think much past

431
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,460
Giving you these.

432
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,680
Berlin. Nigeria.

433
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,000
The comrie group.

434
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,000
Why not jfk

435
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,180
And the lindbergh baby while you're at it?

436
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,080
Son,

437
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,770
Those matters have been fully vetted.

438
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,710
They're relics.

439
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,980
I had nothing to do with them, and if

440
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,870
This is why you've been pulling data on me,

441
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,080
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

442
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,720
Okay. Well, these records

443
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,920
And a sealed letter explaining my investigation

444
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,730
Into your involvement with these matters

445
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,040
Was sent to five lawyers

446
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,150
Across the country.

447
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,440
If anything happens to me,

448
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,590
If I go missing, anything, if I wind up dead,

449
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,260
That letter is to be unsealed...

450
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,500
And they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.

451
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,390
It doesn't matter.

452
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,530
If a government agent

453
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,130
Who was looking into you is found floating

454
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,600
In the l.A. River, or whatever else you have planned,

455
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,410
Your life, general, will change dramatically.

456
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,680
There will be questions, media coverage and surveillance,

457
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,180
And whatever you and the Company are trying to do next

458
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,540
With your little Laos game,

459
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,940
Or whatever else you have planned,

460
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,930
It'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.

461
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,590
Okay? So back off of me.

462
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,310
You are not

463
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,680
The first person to attempt something

464
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,600
Like this.

465
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,920
Most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.

466
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,700
They've learned to put

467
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,420
Their determination and focus to better use,

468
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,780
And with far greater compensation.

469
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,830
Wrong guy.

470
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,610
We'll see.

471
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,780
"dear mr. White, due to unforeseen circumstances,

472
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,820
"i regret to inform you that I will no longer be able

473
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,270
"to perform services at Gate.

474
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,090
"i thank you for this opportunity.

475
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,140
"i'm deeply sorry

476
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,830
"if this places you in a difficult position.

477
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,540
"i have simply not been able to escape these circumstances.

478
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,700
Thank you for the wonderful, enriching opportunity..."

479
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,130
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

480
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,900
Does it sound like you?

481
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,360
Good. Yeah.

482
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,970
Look,

483
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,470
I Don't even know who you are, okay?

484
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,220
Just let me go...

485
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,160
Shut up.

486
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,220
And you wondered

487
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,290
How I got to be the Top salesman in the northeast region.

488
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,690
Sorry, okay?

489
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,940
Sorry.

490
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,890
Consider this a warning.

491
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,380
Old Teddy Bagwell

492
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,870
May be Coosa county trash,

493
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,310
But Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.

494
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,320
One of the Gate corporation's

495
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,390
Tippy-top Sellers, as a matter of fact.

496
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,810
Step into my office.

497
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,650
Well, there should be a room-- eight by ten.

498
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,140
Whistler's point of entry.

499
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,360
That's a closet.

500
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,880
No, it's not.

501
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,120
Tonic and lime, please.

502
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,270
Thank you

503
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,170
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.

504
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,410
I wonder if you could help me.

505
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,310
It's my 22-year-old cousin's bachelorette party.

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,050
That's hardly the salt mines.

507
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,560
Wait for it.

508
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,400
There's a scavenger hunt,

509
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,710
And my team has tasked me

510
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,550
With getting a photograph in a whale's suite.

511
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,350
I'm a whale?

512
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,730
With a very scary bodyguard

513
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,290
And a very gorgeous watch.

514
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,010
And you want to take a picture in my room?

515
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
And I realize it's a completely inappropriate request,

516
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,620
But they're already calling me a wet blanket.

517
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,510
I'm sorry.

518
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,740
I just can't help you.

519
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,870
What if I said "please"?

520
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm actually a little desperate.

521
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,230
Best of luck.

522
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,540
Drinks are on the gentleman.

523
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,260
Have a Nice Day.

524
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,750
You, too.

525
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,640
Don't take it personally.

526
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,800
You're not his type.

527
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,730
Right before you sat down,

528
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,230
He asked me if I liked to party.

529
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,590
Absolutely not! No way! Oh, come on.

530
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,830
Take one for the team.

531
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,140
Maricruz will never know.

532
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,230
I'm gonna snap his neck.

533
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Get to his room, stay two minutes, then leave, all right?

534
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,360
Yeah, yeah, and in the meantime, what? In the elevator?

535
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,140
Just play hard to get, you know, and then let him nuzzle

536
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,240
A little bit. Whoa, whoa...!

537
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,270
Hey, whoa! What option we got?

538
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,120
Come on, man. What option we got?

539
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,980
Give me one.

540
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,170
You can't. Here.

541
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,430
Go ahead. There's nothing back there.

542
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,840
I know.

543
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,720
Do we have anything sharp?

544
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,630
So, what are you hearing, uh, Scylla is worth, huh?

545
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,420
Me, I'm hearing

546
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,520
Millions.

547
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,380
Is that a rough ballpark

548
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,590
In terms of what you, uh... What you've been told?

549
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,740
What do we have here?

550
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,410
Go ahead, back up.

551
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,390
You and me and a dark hole.

552
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,990
Just like old Times, pretty.

553
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,790
You first

554
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,160
How are the chips falling for you?

555
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,670
Spent my last buck on the beer.

556
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,190
What are the options when you're broke in vegas?

557
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,270
I guess I got to work that out, huh?

558
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,830
What if you didn't have to?

559
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,020
I may have a little business

560
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,140
To throw your way.

561
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,040
What kind?

562
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
The easy kind...

563
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,560
With a $1,000 payout.

564
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,790
What's your cognac?

565
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,360
I've never had it.

566
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,690
I've got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.

567
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,250
Join me.

568
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,140
This is private business.

569
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,210
Between men.

570
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,100
They're on their way up.

571
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,860
Get ready.

572
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,000
I love it-- mr. Macho man.

573
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,300
What's next?

574
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,810
I Don't know, why Don't you figure it out?

575
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm Done helping you.

576
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,220
Sounds like someone's caught

577
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,820
In the old captivity of negativity.

578
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,420
Let's get you in a more affirmative mindset.

579
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,800
What's next?

580
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,000
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.

581
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,650
And then, you're gonna be arrested

582
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,530
And taken back to Fox River.

583
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,700
Just how do you plan on...

584
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,880
Stop, y'all have no idea what you're doing.

585
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,510
Scofield, you can't do this without me.

586
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,690
Self's on his way.

587
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,830
Mark my words!

588
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,960
Got your message.

589
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Y'all have no idea

590
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,030
What you're doing!

591
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,950
Thanks, Alex.

592
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,930
Great city.

593
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,460
I guess so.

594
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,090
That's the thing about vegas.

595
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,050
Doesn't judge you.

596
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,090
Any form of pleasure is acceptable here.

597
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,250
Am I crazy, or is there a note of plum in there?

598
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,900
Maybe.

599
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,160
Have a seat.

600
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,810
Did you serve?

601
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,190
Serve who?

602
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,210
In the military.

603
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,470
You look like a devil dog.

604
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,860
No, sir, I've never been in the service before.

605
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,920
Filling up Nice.

606
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,770
Sucre must be in close proximity.

607
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,690
Getting oiled, most likely.

608
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,640
One and half tours in vietnam.

609
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,040
Purple heart

610
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,800
In a friendly fire exchange near hue.

611
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,220
Sorry to hear it.

612
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,830
What I learned at hue,

613
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,660
Though valuable, also cost me

614
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,730
A great deal.

615
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,430
Specifically...

616
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,550
Three square inches of upper groin thigh meat.

617
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,680
And with that...

618
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,130
My reproductive and sexual function.

619
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,510
So... So you can't...

620
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,220
Mr. Villalobos, I'd like you to meet my wife.

621
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,690
I'm Alexa.

622
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,370
You want me to bang your wife?

623
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,370
May i pay you thousands?

624
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,310
He's got a minute.

625
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,540
Then I'm going after him.

626
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,370
Did it copy the card?

627
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,180
Yep.

628
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,440
All right, download that.

629
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,480
You got five minutes.

630
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,020
Well?

631
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,520
His wife was up there.

632
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,290
And...?

633
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,700
It stays in vegas.

634
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,570
Uh, hey, guys.

635
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm gonna go hit the head, and I'll be out

636
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,000
In a minute, all right?

637
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,730
Yes.

638
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,420
Two... Two... Two pulls.

639
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
There he is

640
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,730
Two pulls, and he won the progressive.

641
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,520
Where the hell is he?

642
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,010
I'll go get him.

643
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,390
Mr. Glenn.

644
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,870
We got a problem.

645
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,370
It was made clear

646
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,540
You were never again welcome

647
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,380
In any nevada gaming establishment.

648
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,420
Wait, wait, uh, I was told there was only a five-year...

649
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,060
No such thing was said to you.

650
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,630
What's that do? It's a battery pack

651
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,950
For a video game console.

652
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,430
You'll need to buy a new one.

653
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,850
I already downloaded the card onto my laptop,

654
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,090
And... And I can build another device.

655
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,700
You said this one takes months.

656
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,630
We Don't have months.

657
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,520
You know what?

658
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,130
We ought to leave your ass in the desert.

659
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,210
Let's get him back to l.A., and let Self sort him out.

660
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,620
Let's go.

661
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,570
For a little guy, he has some set of lungs.

662
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,670
How's Bellick and the girl? All taken care of.

663
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,710
I'm gonna keep t-bag in protective custody

664
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,580
Until we get Scylla-- then, I'm gonna make somebody

665
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,720
At illinois doc very, very happy.

666
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,770
But more importantly,

667
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,280
What the hell is that room downstairs?

668
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,920
That's not where they keep the device

669
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,200
That decodes Scylla, is it?

670
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,210
No.

671
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,150
That's just what t-bag thought.

672
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,470
The road to Scylla only begins down there.

673
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,560
This is the room where we've got t-bag now.

674
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,620
Just past the south wall,

675
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,880
There's an access tunnel that runs

676
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,360
For about 300 yards or so.

677
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,360
We get through that, we're in.

678
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,230
That's where we can decode Scylla.

679
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,250
And this is the building

680
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,430
Where general Krantz's office is.

681
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,630
There you go. I was there today,

682
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,820
But I have to tell you, the security

683
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,020
In that place is unbelievable.

684
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,060
According to the blueprint,

685
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,030
The substructure is completely exposed.

686
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,410
It shouldn't take more than 24 hours

687
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,580
To get in there. It's only gonna take 24 hours?

688
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,970
All we have to do is get that last card first.

689
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,930
Well, based on what I've deciphered so far,

690
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,460
We're gonna need around-the-clock access to Gate,

691
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,730
Starting immediately.

692
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,740
If you can get us some suits and ids,

693
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,470
We could go in there as irs agents

694
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,670
Auditing the books-- I mean, considering

695
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,940
The kind of racket they're running,

696
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,990
Nobody would have a problem believing that.

697
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,150
Can you make that happen?

698
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,670
Yeah, I could do it.

699
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
It's under the can.

700
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,650
Hello?

701
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,230
We have a lot in common.

702
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,230
Yeah, who is this?

703
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,820
Just another interested party in what you're up to.

704
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,950
Yeah, what's that?

705
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,970
Scylla.

706
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,510
Open the envelope.

707
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,840
The pages I've got

708
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,150
Only go up to 77.

709
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,990
Is this more blueprint?

710
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,440
I Don't know.

711
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,040
What do you want?

712
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,630
I Don't know what you've Done

713
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
With Bagwell, but unless I see him,

714
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,870
You're not getting the rest of the pages.

715
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,890
Is that right?

716
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,830
Give me that.

717
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Who is this?

718
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,960
Hello, Michael.

719
00:43:07,490 --> 00:44:03,960
