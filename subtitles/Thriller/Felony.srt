- Yeah. Goodbye, sweetheart.
- <i>See ya.</i>

89
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:11,635
I said "fuck" in front of the kid.

90
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,643
You know, if no one reacted,
the kid wouldn't pick up on it.

"Fuck, fuck, fuck, granddad."

00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:55,601
- He doesn't. Bullshit, he does.
- Oh, look at you, protecting him!

158
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,067
Is that all?

159
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,171
Well, no. This is kind of a
courtesy call, actually.

160
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,571
Uh, we just...

161
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,683
Hold that... No, no. It's alright.
Hold that, will you? Thank you.

162
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:12,467
Just so you know, we found
your pedophile boyfriend.

163
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:16,819
He's in Newcastle. Thank you.

164
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,763
Now, we've got enough to charge...

165
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:22,674
To charge Victor, so you'll
be next in line, Sarah,

166
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,651
so you might want a couple of
days to consider your options.

167
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,506
Fuck off.

168
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,331
Well, don't say we didn't warn you.

169
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,825
We'll see you again in a few days.

170
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:34,291
Oh, and, Sarah, I nearly forgot.

171
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,074
We found the kid's
toy pram yesterday.

172
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:41,779
It was covered in prints.
Adult female.

173
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,729
Cheerio.

174
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:50,867
♪ When the dog bites
when the bee stings ♪

175
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,915
♪ When I'm... ♪

176
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,859
Oh, they'll be talking
to each other now.

177
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:49,809
Hey.

178
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:55,665
Hey, kid. Hey.

179
00:13:57,523 --> 00:14:00,337
Hey, hey, hey.

180
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,969
Hey!

181
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:08,049
Hey!

182
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,971
<i>Triple 0. What service
do you require?</i>

183
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,819
Ambulance. Emergency.

184
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,091
<i>Ambulance emergency. What suburb?</i>

185
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:36,978
Kings Park.

186
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,667
<i>Okay, Kings Park. And what's
the exact address there?</i>

187
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,738
I'm on Epson Road,

188
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,195
and the nearest cross
street is, uh...

189
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:48,339
Fuck. Um...

190
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,066
Uh...

191
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:53,107
- <i>That's okay. That's okay. We can...</i>
- Oh, it's quarry... Quarry road.

192
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,283
<i>Okay, so it's Epson Road
with a cross of Quarry Road.</i>

193
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:59,955
<i>- Is it in Kings Park? Is that in Sydney?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,491
<i>Alright, and what's your
telephone number there?</i>

195
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:04,722
Uh. Sorry?

196
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:10,130
- <i>Your telephone number.</i>
- Oh, 0525-633-332.

197
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,659
<i>Tell me exactly what's happened.</i>

198
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,539
There's a boy and he's on the road

199
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,987
and he's had a...
He's fallen off his bike.

200
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,683
<i>Okay, so...</i>

201
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,899
And he's hit his head
and he's not moving.

202
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,121
<i>Okay, alright. Do you think that maybe
he could have been hit by a car?</i>

203
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:32,210
Uh... no. I don't know.

204
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,507
- <i>Okay. Alright.</i>
- I mean... there's a possibility,

205
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:39,026
but he may have just fallen
off his bike. I don't know.

206
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>Okay, but he's lying on
the road with the bike,</i>

207
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,953
<i>and you can't see
anything else around?</i>

208
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,859
Um, hold on a sec. Hold on.

209
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,936
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yep.

210
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:56,691
Someone's just arrived.

211
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,061
- Um...
- Someone's just arrived?

212
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,658
<i>- Like a vehicle?</i>
- Yeah, like a truck. Hold on.

213
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,897
Hey, mate, can you...

214
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,866
Can you make sure that
no-one drives past here

215
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,939
or make sure they're in that lane.
Hurry up! I'm a cop, alright.

216
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,755
- Keep the lights flashing.
- Is he alright?

217
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:16,018
Yeah, yeah. Um, hold... what? Yeah.

218
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,611
Sorry, I'm trying to do
two things at once. What?

219
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:22,928
<i>That's okay. How about you put
the phone on speakerphone?</i>

220
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,507
- Yeah. Can you hear me?
- <i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

221
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,739
<i>Now, is there anything around
that you can keep him warm with?</i>

222
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,882
<i>Like, a jacket, a blanket?</i>

223
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:35,251
Oh, yeah, well, I can get
something from my car.

224
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,907
<i>Okay, that'd be great. Is there
someone that can look after the child?</i>

225
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,499
Yeah, there's a guy here.
Hold on. I'll go now.

226
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,938
Mate, could you sit
with him for a minute?

227
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:45,683
- I don't know anything about first aid.
- Just make sure he doesn't move.

228
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:49,106
Like, maybe cradle his head. I'm
just getting something from my car.

229
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,376
Yell out if anything happens.

230
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,257
Here it is.

231
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,937
Just here.

232
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:29,395
<i>He still hasn't moved,
but he's still breathing.</i>

233
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,515
<i>I'll just move you out
of the way for a sec.</i>

234
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,210
<i>- Sorry.</i>
- <i>Ya.</i>

235
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,224
<i>What's happened to him?</i>

236
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:39,378
<i>I think he's just had a
head injury, I... I guess.</i>

237
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,834
<i>Were you actually
involved in the incident?</i>

238
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,683
Were you involved in the incident?

239
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:49,875
Alright, just ask them why
a model citizen on the dole

240
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,795
would want to buy
three mobile phones.

241
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,931
- Just ask them that, alright?
- <i>It's a good question.</i>

242
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,219
Yeah, well, there is
method in all this.

243
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,483
Yeah, but just... just tell
me that the intercepts hold.

244
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,009
<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

245
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:14,131
City west 102, we're a
detective unit in the area...

246
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,018
Hold on. What are
you doing? What is this?

247
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,250
<i>Copy that, 102.
Your ETA in progress?</i>

248
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,818
Yeah, city west 102.

249
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,322
<i>- ETA, three to five minutes.</i>
- That's not us.

250
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:25,425
<i>Carl, I'm gonna go now.</i>

251
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:29,104
That's traffic.

252
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:37,523
<i>Gentleman in the white
shirt found him.</i>

253
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:39,347
<i>Thanks, ultimo 1.</i>

254
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:42,003
<i>If you could attend outside
the east ocean restaurant.</i>

255
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:45,360
<i>Sussex street at Haymarket...</i>

256
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:01,746
Detective Constable Jim Melic.
This is Detective sergeant Carl summer.

257
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,962
- Sir.
- What's going on?

258
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:07,154
We've got a kid in critical condition,
no perpetrator, one possible witness.

259
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,266
<i>We've got a bystander
who's ID'd the kid.</i>

260
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:13,042
He lives about five blocks away. We're
trying to get in touch with the family.

261
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:15,315
- Who's the witness?
- <i>There's no witness.</i>

262
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:18,387
<i>- The guy found the kid.</i>
- <i>Wha...</i>

263
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:21,106
<i>- He's a detective?</i>
- <i>That's the guy, yeah.</i>

264
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:24,530
Yeah, well, wait on a minute. I don't
understand. Is this his scene or what?

265
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,891
Um... look, I was told
that he's the witness,

266
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:31,187
he's the one that found the kid.
Just get your guy back here.

267
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,449
- Constable?
- <i>Yep?</i>

268
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:40,050
Sir, I just, um... I just
wanted to say I, um...

269
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,627
I trained with Liam.

270
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:47,218
He was a great, great guy.

271
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

272
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:54,834
He's... He's a detective.
Off duty. He was just driving.

273
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:59,442
So, what, he's a witness? A suspect?
What, first on the scene?

274
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:02,097
I've literally just barely
started speaking to him.

275
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,824
<i>Hey, Carl.</i>

276
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,002
Hi, Mal. This is Jim.

277
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,426
- <i>Jim Melic. How are you?</i>
- Yeah, yeah. We were introduced.

278
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:19,506
- That's right.
- Yeah, he's over from Mosman.

279
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:20,658
That's right.

280
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,708
- Yeah.
- So, what, what is it?

281
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:26,099
Fallen, you think? Or maybe
a fail to stop, you reckon?

282
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,266
<i>Uh, well... It could
be a fail to stop.</i>

283
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,995
<i>What, you didn't
see anything, or...?</i>

284
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:35,859
Jim, go and help those boys out with the
perimeter, will you? Make it your scene.

285
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,810
- Uh...
- I'll handle stuff here.

286
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,762
Just open a wider perimeter.

287
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:43,408
- Bloody rubberneckers.
- Righto. Copy that.

288
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:46,099
Come on, folks. You know the drill.

289
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,306
<i>Don't set up there.
This is a stupid spot to park.</i>

290
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:52,369
So, I, uh... heard you
took a shot yesterday.

291
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:56,274
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a very lucky one.

292
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,024
Up too bloody early
anyway, aren't you?

293
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:07,602
Don't worry, we'll have you out of
here in a minute, so just, uh...

294
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:09,555
You know what? Actually,
you guys can piss off.

295
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:14,224
Get down there beyond the truck,
alright? Take a hike. Let's go. Come on.

296
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:17,427
Hey, I want tape up here, across
the road in front of the van.

297
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:21,265
No-one gets through,
alright. Who's on traffic?

298
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,784
Fucking hell.

299
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:55,537
- Constable, come here.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,402
So, Constable, Detective Toohey's
obviously a colleague of mine,

301
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,059
and with all due respect,
Detective, I believe you.

302
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,219
I know you to be an upright
citizen, for the most part, anyway.

303
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,810
So I'd like you to be present
for the witness statement

304
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,762
if you would, for posterity,
whatever that means.

305
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,978
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

306
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,370
It's your call, Constable.

307
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:20,082
You stay and do this. I'll
oversee the forensics, alright?

308
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,971
Yes, sir.

309
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,018
Quite a character.

310
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,034
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:30,099
So run me through what you saw.

312
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,888
Uh, so I was driving up around the bend,
I was traveling north on my way home,

313
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:40,370
and... oh, well I saw the... I saw the
kid, but I thought he was a shape

314
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:43,218
or I don't know what on the road.

315
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,714
And I was just sort of stopped
here, and then there's,

316
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:49,554
in the middle lane, a car stopped,

317
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:53,906
just sort of idling with,
like, brake lights on.

318
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:57,906
But when I stopped,
he... he just took off.

319
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:02,418
That's when I came back and then
I made the call to emergency.

320
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,849
That was about 15 minutes ago.

321
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:10,161
<i>Ready in one, two, three.</i>

322
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:35,219
Has there been any word on the kid?

323
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,280
Well, they won't know until
they get him to the hospital.

324
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,754
<i>Excuse me, officer?
What is going on?</i>

325
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,962
There's been an accident
just across the road.

326
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,962
<i>Do you know his name?</i>

327
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,971
<i>- He's in the ambulance?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

328
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:56,722
Can you get one of these
guys to take me to a hospital?

329
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,226
Please wait.

330
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:01,074
<i>No, I need to go to the hospital.</i>

331
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:04,146
<i>I need... no, I need to go now.
I need to go now.</i>

332
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:07,698
<i>No. Please, take me to the hospital.</i>

333
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:12,016
<i>No, I need to go now.
I need to go now.</i>

334
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:19,920
I think we're just
about done here, mate.

335
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:30,322
Uh..huh. Yeah, look,
I just can't actually hear.

336
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:33,490
I've got the bloody vacuum cleaner
behind me. What was that?

337
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:37,490
Oh, okay. Yep, no worries. Alright.

338
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,827
Cheers, mate. Thank you.

339
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,491
You want to sign this?

340
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:45,937
It's the statement for the
possible fail to stop.

341
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:53,267
Yeah, it's right down
there at the bottom.

342
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,834
Mm..hm.

343
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:57,138
<i>Hey, I'm looking at this file</i>

344
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,650
<i>and I'm just curious what got
you so into this Victor bloke.</i>

345
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:05,170
I mean, you've got virtually
nothing on him, aside from...

346
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:07,698
<i>- Well, he's on the offenders register...</i>
- He did it.

347
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,545
- <i>Well, yeah, but...</i>
- Well, watch the tape.

348
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:13,425
That's a disc.

349
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:16,018
The disc. Watch it.

350
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:19,185
- <i>I've watched the disc.</i>
- Watch it again.

351
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:22,226
- Got it.
- I've got a date with my mother.

352
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:25,458
Now, the file for the telephone intercept
should be up. Listen to every word.

353
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,602
If the footnote says,
'nothing of interest, '

354
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,611
take it with a large pinch of sodium
chloride. Find something.

355
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,530
<i>If you look hard enough,
you always will.</i>

356
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:35,666
That's the way you're gonna impress me,
not by bringing me cups of coffee.

357
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,098
The intercepts hold.

358
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:41,392
Right. We're stirring
the pot good now.

359
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:50,512
Yeah.

360
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:54,064
Uh, yeah. Cheers.

361
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:05,874
Together...

362
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,546
Bitch again,

363
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:16,529
dog...

364
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,322
Sorry.

365
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:47,794
Hey!

366
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:49,872
Hey, nice of you to join us!

367
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:52,626
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi!

368
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,002
That was awesome, mum.

369
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:56,498
- Thank you, darling.
- Honestly, I'm stuffed.

370
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,730
<i>Young William is in a
critical condition</i>,

371
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,706
<i>and it may never be known
what caused his injuries.</i>

372
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:16,914
<i>Police are appealing to anyone...</i>

373
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:41,298
Babe?

374
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,168
We're cutting the cake soon.

375
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,650
You know, if you're not
gonna tell me things,

376
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:00,720
then can you tell your
friends not to either?

377
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:08,656
You were shot at.

378
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,624
Red cordial is like crack.

379
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,450
<i>Oh..hh!</i>

380
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:50,641
Dad.

381
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:51,857
Hey, Mal. How are you?

382
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,832
- How are you going, Brendan?
- Good, mate.

383
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:02,930
Sleepy.

384
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,498
Jemma, how are you?

385
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:08,016
- I'm good. How are you doing?
- Yeah, good. Real good.

386
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,282
<i>Need a beer?</i>

387
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:14,802
Oh, God. How'd you pull up?

388
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,913
How do I look like I pulled up?

389
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:19,890
- Hideous.
- Yeah, thanks. It's how I feel.

390
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:22,738
So, Mal, are they sidelining you?

391
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,104
Uh, I don't know.

392
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,888
Maybe.

393
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:31,665
Does your wife actually
know you're a cop?

394
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,233
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:57,618 --> 00:31:00,240
- It's fine.
- Hi, um...

396
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,762
- What is...?
- I'm a detective.

397
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:06,610
I was called to the
accident this morning.

398
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,713
I just dropped by to see how you're
doing, but I should probably take off.

399
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,600
Come in.

400
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,936
Please.

401
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:18,448
Okay.

402
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,122
This is my boy, William.
My cheeky boy.

403
00:31:27,123 --> 00:31:31,634
If you could see him,
he's so cheeky.

404
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:36,912
I almost expect him to jump off the bed
and say he's been playing a trick on me.

405
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,752
I'm Jim, by the way.

406
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:48,047
My name's Ankhila.

407
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,265
Yeah.

408
00:31:57,266 --> 00:32:02,161
Well, I just... I just dropped by to
see if there's anything we can do,

409
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:04,818
I can do, anything you need.

410
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:08,368
Thank you. Very kind.

411
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:12,719
There's only one thing that I need.

412
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,744
Would you get that, Carl?

413
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,130
- Jim.
- <i>G'day, sir.</i>

414
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:30,768
<i>- Could I have a word?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in.

415
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:39,601
- Did you get anywhere?
- Uh, no. Not yet, no.

416
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,777
Still got a little more to
get through, though, so...

417
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:45,744
Oh, right. Come into the den.

418
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,457
Want to take a pew?

419
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:53,329
No, that's alright, mate.
I won't hang around.

420
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,346
So what's up?

421
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:59,602
Um, well, something's kind
of been playing on my mind

422
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,482
and I just wondered if I
could run it past you.

423
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:06,226
Yeah, well, you won't grow hair on your
palms, no matter what anybody tells you.

424
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:11,122
Um, this morning, the hit-and-run,

425
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:14,898
one of our detectives was at the
scene. Detective Toohey, was it?

426
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,010
- Mal.
- <i>Mal. Yeah.</i>

427
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:20,658
Well... I...

428
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:24,690
It's usually in a case like that,

429
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:28,082
normally, wouldn't we run a
full forensic on the vehicle?

430
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,545
- Take the vehicle in...
- <i>Well, yeah, yeah.</i>

431
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:32,498
Well, that's exactly what we did.

432
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,225
<i>Well, yeah, but a thorough forensic.</i>

433
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:36,241
Forensics had a good
look at the commodore.

434
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:38,513
- I made sure of it.
- They had a quick look at it.

435
00:33:38,514 --> 00:33:42,353
Jim, has this just occurred to you
or was this on your mind earlier?

436
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,242
Yeah, it was kind of on
my mind earlier, yeah.

437
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:47,250
Well, why didn't you bring it up?

438
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:49,106
You're my superior.
I didn't want to...

439
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:52,082
- You thought we skipped a beat?
- <i>No, not at all. No.</i>

440
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:56,434
I just... I don't know, you know.
I just wasn't sure, that's the thing,

441
00:33:56,627 --> 00:34:01,234
why the full forensic
wasn't done on his car.

442
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:04,050
He's one of us, and
he's made a statement.

443
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:06,098
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

444
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:08,050
<i>When I sent you away at the scene,</i>

445
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:10,674
<i>I did it for a reason.
I did it so, you know,</i>

446
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:15,057
I could ask Mal if he had,
you know, anything to say.

447
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:18,481
You know, to give him the respect of not
being treated like a criminal in public

448
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,657
if he had anything to hide.

449
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:23,441
- So you just asked him?
- <i>Too right.</i>

450
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:26,610
And there is no doubt that he
was clear and direct with me.

451
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,081
Of course, yeah.

452
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:31,762
- <i>Because...</i>
- No, no, sorry, Carl. Sorry.

453
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:34,705
I didn't mean to come
in here and be a pest.

454
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,914
I'll... I'll get out of
your hair, mate. Sorry.

455
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:41,648
No, no, no. Come this way.
It's a shortcut.

456
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,890
No, you didn't do
anything wrong, Jim.

457
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,802
<i>I had the same feeling
myself at the scene.</i>

458
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:48,497
No, the only thing you did wrong

459
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:50,898
was taking such a long time
before bringing it to me.

460
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,425
But, you know, it takes a while
working with new people

461
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,754
to start seeing with the same eyes.

462
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,721
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Alright.

463
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:02,895
- See you later.
- Okay.

464
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,354
A spotty dog, is it?

465
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:14,866
"They came to a yard full
of dinghies and yachts,"

466
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,840
"and round they went."

467
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,754
Oh, why did you do that?

468
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:22,738
"Except bottomley potts..."

469
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:25,426
Didn't you know, the
last one, I saw hairy...

470
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:28,594
- He stuck? He stuck?
- Yeah, he's stuck.

471
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,576
He can't move.

472
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,418
<i>They asleep?</i>

473
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:37,396
Yeah, finally.

474
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:57,202
You fancy a quickie?

475
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:58,289
Hmm?

476
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,666
Hmm?

477
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,330
We only have, you know,
today and tomorrow

478
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:04,048
and then we miss the
boat for another month.

479
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:22,127
Let's go.

480
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,063
Okay.

481
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,425
<i>...it's one, two, goal!</i>

482
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:36,304
<i>What a wonderful strike by...</i>

483
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,249
- Hey.
- Hey.

484
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,961
I just spoke to Jemma.
Little boy's in a coma.

485
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:44,978
I'd say it's induced because
of the head injuries,

486
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:48,440
which is not as bad as it sounds.
His name's William Sarduka.

487
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:51,601
The details are all there. The
mother's there most of the time, so...

488
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,841
Come on, guys. Let's go. Ready?

489
00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:54,897
Bye, daddy.

490
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,354
Yeah, say bye. Say bye, babe.
"Love you, daddy."

491
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:00,944
- Bye, dad.
- <i>Bye. See you</i>.

492
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:04,047
<i>I can open it.</i>

493
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:21,713
Detective Toohey, Nick
Jemanus, The Day Report.

494
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:23,857
We're doing a story on the
recent spate of hit-and-runs

495
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,962
- in the area where Asian and African...
- I'm not authorized to talk.

496
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,178
Could we have a word with you?

497
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,417
You have media liaison, mate.
You know the story.

498
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:33,008
What's it feel like to be a hero?

499
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,761
<i>You were in pursuit of a suspect.</i>

500
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:50,514
<i>- Shots fired?</i>
- Two shots.

501
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:53,649
Am I gonna have to take time
out over all this stuff?

502
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,945
Not necessarily. I mean, you
didn't discharge your weapon.

503
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:58,865
Mmm.

504
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:01,745
But in 2006...

505
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,698
Mmm.

506
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:07,217
...discharged your weapon.

507
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:09,519
- By accident.
- By accident.

508
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,287
Where?

509
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,799
In the elevator.

510
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:24,210
I was dicking around and...
It was dumb.

511
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,095
So...

512
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,672
It was 2006.

513
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:35,441
You look tired.

514
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,457
I'm tired.

515
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,025
You sleeping?

516
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:41,330
Yeah. It's just been a
big couple of days.

517
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:46,865
I took a sleeping pill,
so I'm a little bit foggy today.

518
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:50,482
Um, it was a 'razepam.

519
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:53,329
Do you normally take
such strong medication?

520
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,345
No.

521
00:39:55,346 --> 00:39:58,129
My wife is a nurse, so it's just...

522
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,960
you know, it's around the
house, so I took one.

523
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:06,161
Okay.

524
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:08,816
That's fine.

525
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:18,450
There you are. You about done?

526
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:21,297
He all better now?
Brain fixed? Tick?

527
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:22,705
We were just getting started.

528
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:26,127
Well, I'm sorry, but I
need to borrow him.

529
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,786
Mm..hm. Sorry.

530
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:32,303
Okay. I'll catch you later.

531
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:40,209
<i>One of your round-ups from the
weekend is keen for a plea deal.</i>

532
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,569
- <i>Uh-huh. Which one?</i>
- <i>Doolan.</i>

533
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,322
Turns out he's an ex-cop.

534
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:48,625
Brisbane. Uniform.

535
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:51,377
- Really?
- Yep.

536
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:54,706
I heard about this business
with this Indian kid.

537
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,145
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

538
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:59,793
So it's, uh, all good?

539
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,617
Uh, yeah, yeah.

540
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:05,649
I mean, it was definitely
odd, but it's fine.

541
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,282
Good.

542
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:14,319
Come.

543
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:18,896
<i>Ah, there he is.</i>

544
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:23,761
What does he want?

545
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:26,033
- He's gonna give us three names.
- Three names for what?

546
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:29,713
- Possession.
- Possession?

547
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:34,513
Possession with intent to sell, and
my client's agreed to cooperate.

548
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,169
<i>He was manufacturing.</i>

549
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,265
He was cooking up, so, you know...

550
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,993
We want the communications.

551
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:46,095
Three names. Final offer.

552
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:49,903
Mmm. Mm..mm..mm.

553
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:53,970
I imagine this whole business
is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

554
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,721
<i>For a decorated officer.</i>

555
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:01,265
<i>It says you were injured
in 2002, discharged,</i>

556
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:05,007
<i>and I bet they gave you a
pretty crap payout too, hm?</i>

557
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:09,330
So, you know, I get it, man.

558
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:13,426
Look, let's forget it.
I get it. I totally get it.

559
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:17,841
You got two kids, and you don't want
this getting out in the press, do you?

560
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:20,337
<i>But it... it could.</i>

561
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,385
<i>So, look, this is what
I think you should do.</i>

562
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:24,561
What you should do is you tell
us how they're communicating,

563
00:42:24,562 --> 00:42:26,897
give us your names, yeah,
but how they're communicating.

564
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:29,489
We'll give you a letter of
assistance for the magistrate,

565
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:34,546
which is great, and we'll keep you
out of the press, get you immunity.

566
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,497
<i>Or you don't cooperate with us</i>

567
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:41,745
<i>and you end up in</i> The Daily Telegraph
<i>tomorrow morning,</i> which is not good.

568
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:44,369
You know, we'll leak that
stuff, we'll give 'em a photo

569
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,281
'cause, you know, we need a
bit of good press around here.

570
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:49,425
<i>So we have three new players</i>

571
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:53,746
<i>and we know how they're
communicating, finally.</i>

572
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:57,841
We have an email address
they all have access to

573
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,858
through a shared password.

574
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:02,481
You'll love 'em. There's
new ones from last night.

575
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:06,289
Our lovely friend alcohol.
Drunk-dial. Sarah to Tina.

576
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:12,177
"Stupid bitch."
"Grow the fuck up."

577
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:14,961
"Stupid slut."

578
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:16,913
"Whore."

579
00:43:16,914 --> 00:43:19,793
Now, she doesn't give
anything specific away here,

580
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:22,896
<i>but here...</i>

581
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:24,817
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

582
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:27,793
<i>This is Tina to Victor, and I quote,</i>

583
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:32,721
<i>"why am I fucking, you know,
protecting you two anyway?"</i>

584
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,129
<i>Just down the hall,
on the right, second floor.</i>

585
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,463
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

586
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:47,505
- Jemma.
- Hey.

587
00:44:47,506 --> 00:44:49,297
What room is he in? Is it 43?

588
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:50,481
43.

589
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:53,327
I'll catch up with you.

590
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:18,353
<i>And Jake made William a card.
Didn't you, Jake?</i>

591
00:46:18,354 --> 00:46:21,455
- This is William's mum.
- Thank you.

592
00:46:21,585 --> 00:46:23,631
And this is Malcolm.

593
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,369
- Hi. Hi. These are for you.
- Thank you.

594
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:32,176
We wanted to wait a day or two.
We didn't want to intrude.

595
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:33,937
You were with him?

596
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,953
- You helped him?
- Uh... uh, yeah.

597
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:40,623
They said without
you, he wouldn't...

598
00:46:40,912 --> 00:46:45,679
Thank you. I don't know how
to thank you properly.

599
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:47,473
That's...

600
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:51,313
- No, there is no words to thank you.
- I really,

601
00:46:51,314 --> 00:46:53,390
I didn't...

602
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:58,737
Look, it's... it's really...

603
00:46:58,738 --> 00:47:01,007
Thank you. Thank you.

604
00:47:01,841 --> 00:47:04,369
Hey, we should probably...

605
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,177
We should let you get back to it.
And we've got to feed these little...

606
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:09,616
We just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

607
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:13,359
- ...these rascals.
- Thank you.

608
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:16,177
So, yeah, we didn't want
to intrude for very long.

609
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,137
We just wanted to...

610
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:20,017
You have our number. If you
need anything, please call us.

611
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:20,977
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

612
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:22,192
<i>Bye.</i>

613
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:24,593
- Bye.
- Thank you.

614
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:26,834
<i>Race you there. Whoever
presses the button wins.</i>

615
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:29,713
- <i>Let me press the button!</i>
- <i>Don't run, guys.</i>

616
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,704
<i>Triple 0. What service
do you require?</i>

617
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:13,009
<i>Ambulance. Emergency.</i>

618
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,633
<i>Ambulance emergency. What suburb?</i>

619
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:17,553
<i>Kings Park.</i>

620
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:20,273
<i>Okay. Kings Park. And what's
the exact address there?</i>

621
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,409
<i>I'm on Epson Road</i>

622
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,959
<i>and the nearest
cross street is, uh...</i>

623
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:29,937
<i>Uh...</i>

624
00:48:29,938 --> 00:48:31,185
<i>We can...</i>

625
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:33,777
<i>Ah, it's Quarry... Quarry Road.</i>

626
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,913
<i>Okay. Alright. So tell me
exactly what's happened.</i>

627
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,344
<i>There's a boy and he's on the road</i>

628
00:48:39,345 --> 00:48:44,400
<i>and he's had a...
He's fallen off his bike.</i>

629
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,449
<i>And he's hit his head
and he's not moving.</i>

630
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,545
- What am I supposed to...
- Hang on, wait. Just listen.

631
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:52,913
<i>He's unconscious and
breathing, but he's not moving.</i>

632
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:57,392
<i>Okay. Do you think that maybe
he could have been hit by a car?</i>

633
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:01,873
<i>Uh...</i>

634
00:49:01,874 --> 00:49:04,016
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

635
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:07,856
<i>I mean... there's a possibility...</i>

636
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,065
There's a possibility.

637
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:12,303
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Listen.

638
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,472
- <i>...he's not moving.</i>
- <i>Okay, alright.</i>

639
00:49:15,473 --> 00:49:18,160
<i>Do you think that maybe he
could have been hit by a car?</i>

640
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,704
<i>Uh...</i>

641
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:24,817
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

642
00:49:24,818 --> 00:49:27,633
<i>I mean... there's a possibility,</i>

643
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,897
<i>but he may have just fallen
off his bike. I don't know.</i>

644
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:33,775
<i>Okay, but he's lying on the road...</i>

645
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:41,009
I think we need to investigate
Detective Toohey further.

646
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:45,169
- Oh, Jim, this is the stupid...
- I wanted to defer to you,

647
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,528
but, you know,
I think if it's not too late,

648
00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:50,704
we should run a full
forensic on his car,

649
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:52,689
you know, a structural
check, you know.

650
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,480
<i>Detective Toohey
should be questioned,</i>

651
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,656
<i>perhaps even given a chance
to change his statement.</i>

652
00:49:56,657 --> 00:49:59,280
Or... rather, to make
a formal statement.

653
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:01,073
Look, I just don't know
what you're hearing.

654
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:05,040
The pause, the time it takes him.

655
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,024
I mean, he's lying.
The hesitation in his voice...

656
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:10,000
Okay, okay, just hold up,
just relax, alright.

657
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:12,146
- <i>He's a cop.</i>
- Yeah.

658
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:16,081
Yeah, so he shouldn't be panicked
and hesitating. He's used to these
situations.

659
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:17,553
He's got a little kid
there in serious need.

660
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:20,145
But you don't think it takes him
too long to give a clear answer?

661
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:21,681
<i>Oh, no. I just think
you're reading stuff</i>

662
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:23,632
into what seems to me a
pretty normal situation.

663
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:26,257
Alarm bells aren't ringing for me.

664
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:27,409
He's lying.

665
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,953
- I think you want him to be lying.
- Okay. Then explain this next thing.

666
00:50:31,954 --> 00:50:33,009
<i>Yeah.</i>

667
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:39,600
So the operator keeps him on the line,
yeah, and he doesn't mention anyone else,

668
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:43,185
<i>anything suspicious,
no other cars, yeah?</i>

669
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:46,672
So why in his statement
15 minutes later

670
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:51,057
does he detail seeing another car
when he came across the kid?

671
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:54,097
Tail-lights taking off
around the corner.

672
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:56,688
I mean, you can say he's
under stress, but...

673
00:50:56,689 --> 00:51:01,969
Okay, mate, you relax. This isn't
proof of anything, alright?

674
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:05,361
I'll talk to him, okay?

675
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:10,415
<i>And then I'll decide what's
the best course of action.</i>

676
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:13,102
Okay?

677
00:51:13,585 --> 00:51:15,345
Yeah.

678
00:51:15,346 --> 00:51:19,439
For the record, I think you're
drawing a seriously long bow.

679
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:22,319
With all due respect, I...

680
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:25,967
I really feel strongly
about this, Carl.

681
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,687
<i>You know, and...</i>

682
00:51:30,224 --> 00:51:33,681
<i>I think it's possible that,</i>

683
00:51:33,682 --> 00:51:37,168
you know, your personal
relationship with Detective Toohey

684
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:40,881
<i>- could be clouding the issue a little.</i>
- You really just said that?

685
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,352
<i>Hey, no offense intended.</i>

686
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:45,038
I'll decide whether there's
any offense taken.

687
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,655
<i>Uh, Carl?</i>

688
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,598
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

689
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:58,511
Yeah, I've got a minute.

690
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,607
What's going on?

691
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,831
Where are you right now?

692
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,784
Go and help those boys out
with the perimeter, will you?

693
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,960
Make it your scene.
I'll handle things here.

694
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:40,337
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

695
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:45,201
I want a wider perimeter.
Bloody rubberneckers.

696
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:48,590
Yeah, copy that. Folks,
show some respect.

697
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:53,137
So, I, uh... heard you
took a shot yesterday.

698
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:55,697
Oh, yeah. A very lucky one.

699
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:59,216
Yeah, I was gonna try and make the party,
but Manny keeps me tied to the house.

700
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,849
That's why it's not the best
environment in the world

701
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,960
to be the only one on soda water.

702
00:53:04,594 --> 00:53:06,704
So, you're feeling a bit
under the weather, I bet.

703
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:10,384
Yeah well, we'll have you out
of here in a few minutes,

704
00:53:10,385 --> 00:53:14,607
so just run me through what
happened. You found the kid?

705
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:18,031
Mmm.

706
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:23,599
Yeah, I don't know exactly
what happened, 'cause...

707
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,830
Look, I think that, um...

708
00:53:31,185 --> 00:53:33,358
<i>You think what?</i>

709
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,574
Don't fucking bullshit me.

710
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:46,223
<i>Have you made a statement? Nothing?</i>

711
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,478
Did, uh... Did anyone see you?

712
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,574
How much have you had to drink?

713
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:04,175
- I had a bit, I had a bit.
- Oh, fuck.

714
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:07,120
Uh, are there any marks on the car?

715
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:12,465
I didn't hear any noise,
so I think I hit his body.

716
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:15,633
- I hit him with the side mirror.
- <i>Alright.</i>

717
00:54:15,634 --> 00:54:16,624
Here's what happened.

718
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,537
Here's what happened.

719
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:23,408
You rounded the corner, you saw what you
saw, a shape at the side of the road.

720
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:25,168
A kid, but you didn't
know that then.

721
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:28,529
At the T intersection,
you saw a vehicle,

722
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,913
the engine idling, brake lights. You
don't know what kind of vehicle.

723
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:37,838
Then it took off really quickly,
then you pulled over to help the kid.

724
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:43,342
Alright? Alright?

725
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,288
Okay.

726
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:49,358
<i>Constable, the breathalyzer?</i>

727
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:52,465
Thank you.

728
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:01,136
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

729
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:04,368
Right. Now your turn. Count to ten.

730
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,864
One, two, three, four, five,

731
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:09,297
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

732
00:55:09,298 --> 00:55:13,489
Okay. I'm gonna take care
of the forensics, alright.

733
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:18,320
You play your part. If the wheels fall
off, you're on your own. You hear me?

734
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:21,777
Now, you didn't mean
to do anything bad.

735
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:25,615
Alright? Just fucking relax.
I'll get you through this.

736
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:28,720
- Constable, can you come here?
- Yes, sir.

737
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:31,568
So, no point no no,
not <i>that</i> good of a party.

738
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:34,351
Ready. One, two, three.

739
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:37,358
Bars up?

740
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,167
- Good to go.
- Yep.

741
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:46,670
That's it.

742
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:48,784
Take it easy, Mal.

743
00:55:50,673 --> 00:55:53,774
- It's gonna be fine.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

744
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:52,881
You've got to calm down, okay?

745
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:54,928
You're being paranoid.

746
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:58,704
What business you had going around there
in the first place is the question.

747
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:00,561
What's he going around there for?

748
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:02,608
- He's going around there.
- He's a crusader.

749
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:05,649
Jesus, the pair of you!
What were you thinking?

750
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,105
"If I don't run down there soon with a box
of chocolates, she's gonna be offended?"

751
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:11,536
I've gotta tell the truth.
I've got to come clean.

752
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:14,640
Why? Because you felt a little
rabbit in the headlights?

753
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:18,233
Because you think the woman suspects
something and suddenly you feel worse?

754
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,977
- Because Jim...
- No. Before all that.

755
00:57:20,978 --> 00:57:24,016
- Because it is the right thing to do.
- Oh, really?

756
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:29,486
It's not because all of a sudden you think
the whole thing's gonna come apart?

757
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:33,840
No, ever since this shit just
jumped out of my fucking mouth.

758
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:37,393
Don't distance yourself.
You did that. You did that yourself.

759
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:40,976
- I don't know why I did it.
- Survival's why you did it.

760
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:44,750
And now you've got to own it.
Now, stop with this bullshit.

761
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:46,897
Bullshit.

762
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:48,848
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

763
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:50,576
<i>Now, listen to me for a second.</i>

764
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:53,713
<i>We've got to keep this
tight, Mal, and be smart,</i>

765
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:56,336
and make sure whatever
happens, nothing comes out,

766
00:57:56,337 --> 00:57:59,664
'cause if it does, it's gonna be
worse 'cause we're all in it,

767
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:01,999
the whole force, mate.

768
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,487
I stuck my neck out from the get-go.

769
00:58:05,872 --> 00:58:09,360
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, you told
the first lie. I picked up on it.</i>

770
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:13,072
So, limited forensic, no in-depth,
the breath test. You add it up.

771
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,486
- Carl, I didn't ask for any of that.
- Of course you did,

772
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:18,512
with your "help me" face. Your "I've
pissed my pants, help me" face.

773
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:19,728
<i>- 'Course you fucking did.</i>
- I changed my mind.

774
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,702
Oh, bullshit, you have. Bullshit!

775
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:25,614
Fuck off! No way!

776
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:29,328
Oh, what? You bring
me in and then 180?

777
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:32,015
Bullshit, you will.

778
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:34,992
The bigger picture, Mal.
The bigger picture.

779
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:38,096
Think of your family,
the investigation. Your reputation.

780
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,648
<i>Six months' hard work.
12, 13 arrests.</i>

781
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:44,528
You want to discredit all
of us and unpick that too?

782
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:48,494
<i>Well, I'm not gonna let you.
Grow a fucking brain.</i>

783
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,191
I don't know why we're getting all
worked up about this. I really don't.

784
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:59,056
You know, so... Don't wave yourself
off the pitch for a mistake

785
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:02,672
because suddenly it's eating
away at you. Well, of course it is.

786
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,910
You did some damage.

787
00:59:09,168 --> 00:59:11,728
You remember that woman
that ploughed into Liam?

788
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:13,328
You know, 50s, three kids.

789
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:16,528
Absolutely distraught at
what... what she'd done.

790
00:59:16,529 --> 00:59:21,585
Well, I saw her sat in court. You know,
a million terrible things going on,

791
00:59:21,586 --> 00:59:25,102
<i>you know, worse than yours,
and it was killing me, but,</i>

792
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:27,822
you know, what can you do?

793
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:31,694
Time.

794
00:59:32,145 --> 00:59:37,806
Time and the world swallows events.

795
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:42,318
<i>And it's sad, but that's how it is.</i>

796
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,824
And you and me, you know,

797
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,448
the world is gonna swallow us up,

798
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:53,615
and who knows in the
end if we leave a mark?

799
00:59:53,648 --> 00:59:55,535
But...

800
00:59:56,145 --> 00:59:58,160
But we're doing something.

801
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:02,128
And I like to think we're doing
something good with what we're given.

802
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:06,736
<i>Don't wave yourself off
over this. What do you want?</i>

803
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:09,808
Five years in the nick for...
For nothing?

804
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:11,856
That's stupid.

805
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:16,974
Prison is for pricks that don't
have their punishment here.

806
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:20,686
Not you.

807
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,335
Not me.

808
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:28,206
It doesn't make sense.

809
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:32,654
Alright?

810
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:10,190
Ah, Slim, caught with your
hand in the cookie jar.

811
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,480
We're on. Newcastle's nabbing
Victor and Sarah's being brought in.

812
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:21,006
Let's go.

813
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,158
<i>Got him leaving baggage now.</i>

814
01:01:50,896 --> 01:01:55,662
<i>He's one fuckin' fat
17 year-old, man.</i>

815
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,238
<i>Anyone order a serving
of won-ton kid?</i>

816
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,168
<i>"One fat fuck to go, pwease."</i>

817
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:08,176
Wanna shut up unless you've
got something worth saying?

818
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:12,494
<i>Uh, yeah, copy that. Sorry, Slim.</i>

819
01:02:14,608 --> 01:02:16,464
<i>Yeah, you should have him now.</i>

820
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:18,352
Is that him?

821
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:20,144
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

822
01:02:20,145 --> 01:02:21,646
Shall we go?

823
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,864
- Excuse me, buddy.
- Hey, Nguyen?

824
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:45,711
- Phuk Nguyen, yeah?
- Yeah. What is this about?

825
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:48,560
Oh, I just want to have
a little word with you.

826
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:50,032
Hey, fellas. It's alright.
Hang back.

827
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:53,999
- Yeah, mate, I'll look after that.
- Oh, is that the, uh...

828
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,816
- Is that the new one?
- Uh, yeah.

829
01:02:56,817 --> 01:02:58,000
Let's have a seat.
Let's have a chat.

830
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,120
Alright, mate.

831
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:02,704
Just relax. It's okay. Maybe
that's a bit uncomfortable.

832
01:03:02,705 --> 01:03:05,614
- Yeah, take that off, mate.
- Yeah, take it off.

833
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:13,520
<i>You're fucked, both of you.
You hear me, pig fuck? Fuck you both!</i>

834
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,824
<i>I'll make sure you're fucking dead
by the end of fucking tonight.</i>

835
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:19,056
<i>- How about that? Fucking faggots!</i>
- Keep the threats coming, pal.

836
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:20,898
Yeah? How about this for
a fucking threat, huh?

837
01:03:21,937 --> 01:03:24,111
<i>How about that for a
fucking threat, huh?</i>

838
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:25,424
<i>- Damaging police property.</i>
- Stop it, slim.

839
01:03:25,425 --> 01:03:27,792
I'm fucking 17. What the fuck are
you guys gonna fucking do to me?

840
01:03:27,793 --> 01:03:30,864
Huh? Huh? How about that, huh?

841
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:32,368
<i>Hey, settle down.</i>

842
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:33,648
- <i>Fuck you!</i>
- <i>Settle down!</i>

843
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:36,400
What are you gonna do to me?
Come on, pig! Come on!

844
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:39,119
<i>What do you want?
Fucking faggot pig!</i>

845
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,521
<i>- Come get me, fucking pig!</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

846
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:43,919
<i>Come get me, pig! Come on, pig!</i>

847
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,864
<i>Yeah! You're fucked, pig!
Come get me, pig!</i>

848
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,008
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- <i>Pig! Fuck you!</i>

849
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:49,968
Shut up!

850
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:53,552
Mal!

851
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,872
Say something! Say something!

852
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:07,150
I put a copy of that
report on your desk.

853
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,662
Don't worry. It's all good.

854
01:05:15,888 --> 01:05:17,774
I'm, um...

855
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:22,606
...in trouble, love.

856
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:27,822
I didn't find that kid on the road.

857
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,422
I hit him...

858
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:36,110
...with my car.

859
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,952
<i>I didn't mean to lie
about it. I just did.</i>

860
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,222
<i>I just said it.</i>

861
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:48,878
<i>It just came out of my mouth.</i>

862
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,270
<i>First to emergency
and then to Ambos.</i>

863
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:01,358
I meant to take it back,
but I didn't.

864
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:21,326
'Cause I was scared.

865
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:30,766
So...

866
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:36,206
I'm gonna have to say something.

867
01:06:39,407 --> 01:06:41,517
I've got to tell the truth.

868
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:50,926
He has brain damage.

869
01:06:55,408 --> 01:06:58,254
<i>There's every chance that he'll die.</i>

870
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:01,998
Jemma told me at the hospital.

871
01:07:03,376 --> 01:07:06,256
I didn't think to say
anything because...

872
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:08,526
Jesus Christ.

873
01:07:23,728 --> 01:07:28,622
Um, Carl... knows.

874
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:32,368
And he wants me to
keep my mouth shut.

875
01:07:40,304 --> 01:07:42,957
I want you to listen to him.

876
01:07:46,736 --> 01:07:48,846
To Carl.

877
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:53,325
To not say anything.

878
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:59,566
Don't say anything.

879
01:08:07,664 --> 01:08:10,158
We can live with this.

880
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,279
<i>However, at this stage,
that either the prints or the dog</i>

881
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,328
<i>in fact belong to you.</i>

882
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:37,935
<i>In the circumstances, I'm left
with no choice but to grant bail.</i>

883
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:40,336
The bail will be granted on
the following conditions.

884
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:45,200
You will reside at 65-117
Crayview Crescent, Rossdale Park.

885
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:47,152
<i>You will report to the
officer in charge...</i>

886
01:08:49,681 --> 01:08:53,072
<i>...between the hours of 8am and 7pm.</i>

887
01:08:53,073 --> 01:08:57,839
<i>You will surrender your passport and
you are not to approach any children</i>

888
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,062
<i>or be in the vicinity of
playgrounds or schools.</i>

889
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,848
<i>Carl, will you settle down?</i>

890
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,543
- <i>It's lazy.</i>
- <i>Carl...</i>

891
01:09:06,544 --> 01:09:08,176
It's bullshit and it's lazy.

892
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,808
Listen, Carl, you don't
pull your head in...

893
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:12,239
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

894
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,176
He reoffends, I shall hold this
fucking court personally responsible.

895
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:18,734
<i>How's that for contempt?</i>

896
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,942
Get a couple of glasses.

897
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:50,862
Sometimes I fucking
wonder why I'm here.

898
01:09:55,888 --> 01:09:59,024
Ah. Well, we should
get a good lift off this.

899
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:01,998
What'll I find?
Overdue library book?

900
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:04,558
Um...

901
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:07,950
Aren't you sort of...

902
01:10:08,624 --> 01:10:11,278
Not supposed to...

903
01:10:11,983 --> 01:10:15,919
You've got to learn to finish your
sentences, mate. Not supposed to what?

904
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,933
Nothing.

905
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:22,285
Yeah, well, the courts go back
on shit. Why shouldn't I?

906
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:29,070
Bail. For a guy with the history that he has.
Then he walks out, just like that.

907
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:35,565
To the biggest criminal
of all, the court system.

908
01:10:50,128 --> 01:10:51,343
Shit.

909
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:54,862
Sorry, I've got to...

910
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,792
Ankhila? Hi.

911
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:02,447
Is everything alright?

912
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:10,287
Sure.

913
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:13,838
Yeah, no worries.

914
01:11:17,999 --> 01:11:20,368
Yeah, no worries.

915
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:24,877
Take care. Yep. Bye.

916
01:11:28,879 --> 01:11:32,461
Um, I've got to take off.

917
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:37,326
<i>Anything you need me to
wrap up around here or...?</i>

918
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:41,869
Yeah, yeah, go. Go.

919
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,143
Hello.

920
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:32,397
- Hey.
- Uh... I'm sorry.

921
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:38,511
I just wanted to thank you,
and, um, here you are.

922
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:42,733
That's alright. I was
just in the area, so...

923
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:54,382
So... yes?

924
01:12:58,032 --> 01:13:00,814
Listen, I, um...

925
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:05,968
I just wanted to tell you personally that
we're doing everything we can on our end

926
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,709
to find out who did this,

927
01:13:10,735 --> 01:13:15,054
<i>and, uh, we have some
really strong leads.</i>

928
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:22,191
Wouldn't you want to know?

929
01:13:22,192 --> 01:13:26,926
Mmm... I, um... yes.

930
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:30,447
Look, I think I should
be getting back, okay?

931
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:34,799
- Thank you again for the flowers.
- <i>Ankhila, um...</i>

932
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:41,805
Tomorrow, I'd really love
to help you out, if I can.

933
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:47,504
You know, save time on the bus.

934
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,423
Faster and cheaper than a taxi.

935
01:13:50,864 --> 01:13:53,485
Can I think about it?

936
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:59,470
Yeah. Yeah, of course
you can think about it.

937
01:14:05,903 --> 01:14:07,821
Carl.

938
01:14:08,335 --> 01:14:13,679
Yeah, mate, I'm just about to walk into
my sister's place for dinner. What is it?

939
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,606
Are you following me?

940
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:29,165
Alright, let's be adults about this.
You want to get in the car?

941
01:14:29,871 --> 01:14:32,941
Come on, let's get in
the car and let's talk.

942
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,502
Let's talk here.

943
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:41,360
I, uh... I checked out your theory.

944
01:14:41,361 --> 01:14:46,287
Ran it by the boss and then we had a
conference with two senior-ranked officers.

945
01:14:46,288 --> 01:14:47,631
And?

946
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:50,031
And you need to know what
was passed on to me.

947
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:51,918
Okay.

948
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:56,206
It stops here. No more.

949
01:14:57,584 --> 01:15:00,047
Who were these other
senior-ranked officers, Carl?

950
01:15:00,048 --> 01:15:01,935
- Never you mind.
- "Never you mind"?

951
01:15:01,936 --> 01:15:04,271
No, no. It doesn't matter.
It's a sensitive issue.

952
01:15:04,272 --> 01:15:06,605
They would prefer not to be named.

953
01:15:08,335 --> 01:15:11,245
When exactly did this take place?

954
01:15:12,495 --> 01:15:17,039
There was a meeting, was there?
Yeah, a conference?

955
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,927
Yeah, you just gave
yourself away, mate.

956
01:15:18,928 --> 01:15:21,967
You're making a habit of going
solo, having your own opinions.

957
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:24,879
- I don't like being threatened.
- Who's threatening who?

958
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,703
Making shit up to
influence me. That's a...

959
01:15:26,704 --> 01:15:30,415
And you drove here. I mean,
you're smashed, mate.

960
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:33,615
- You're a fucking prick.
- Alright. Take it easy.

961
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:37,839
Yeah, that's right. That's what
you are. You're the guy nobody likes.

962
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,167
You're the guy in the band
that's always complaining.

963
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:45,679
See, we're in a band, right? Like a
musical band. Can you imagine that?

964
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,999
And when somebody in the band
writes a song, like it or hate it, we
fucking sing it.

965
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,359
And if someone in the band happens to write
a fucking shitty song that nobody likes,

966
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,367
we keep our opinions to
ourselves and sing it anyway.

967
01:15:56,368 --> 01:15:59,407
We don't stand to one side
and laugh and point and say,

968
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:03,087
"Oh! Oh, that's shit.
I'm not doing that."

969
01:16:03,088 --> 01:16:06,798
'Cause that doesn't look
good for the band, does it?

970
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:10,095
And one day you're gonna go bad.

971
01:16:10,096 --> 01:16:13,167
You're gonna write a fucking
shitty song. I know it.

972
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,927
And then where will you be?

973
01:16:14,928 --> 01:16:18,447
On your own, 'cause you're the
guy that wants to go solo.

974
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:21,517
You're the guy with
the best judgment.

975
01:16:24,015 --> 01:16:28,813
Look, he didn't set out to do a bad thing
and don't make it out like he did.

976
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:31,023
Victor.

977
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:35,151
Victor, he set out to do a bad thing
to that little girl. That's who.

978
01:16:35,152 --> 01:16:38,765
Not someone who made a
fucking genuine mistake.

979
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:45,389
So use your fucking head.
Stop being a prick.

980
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:51,053
Finished?

981
01:18:04,783 --> 01:18:06,477
Hold that.

982
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,629
Ankhila, wait.

983
01:18:44,175 --> 01:18:46,573
Ankhila!

984
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:07,437
<i>Level four.</i>

985
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:09,668
<i>No. No.</i>

986
01:20:21,647 --> 01:20:24,237
<i>Mal, Mal.</i>

987
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:29,133
Listen, I thought you should know.
I just found out...

988
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:32,111
That young boy you saved,

989
01:20:32,112 --> 01:20:36,559
yeah, he... he passed
about an hour ago, mate.

990
01:21:50,095 --> 01:21:53,391
<i>Young Indian boy William Sarduka.</i>

991
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:56,335
<i>Tragically, today, William
passed away in hospital</i>

992
01:21:56,336 --> 01:22:00,463
<i>after spending three days in a
coma as a result of his injuries.</i>

993
01:22:00,464 --> 01:22:03,855
<i>He now becomes the fifth
fatality in similar accidents</i>

994
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:06,063
<i>in less than four months.</i>

995
01:22:06,064 --> 01:22:07,855
<i>Coming up next on Sky news,</i>

996
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:11,917

997
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:21,327
<i>Some of us are so focused on our hair
that we're blinded to the fact...</i>

998
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:49,452
I...

999
01:22:49,487 --> 01:22:51,372
I, um...

1000
01:22:56,111 --> 01:22:59,791
I might not seem like a good person,

1001
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,540
<i>but I have to be a good mother.</i>

1002
01:23:03,663 --> 01:23:06,317
<i>I think what I said last night...</i>

1003
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,741
<i>Is right.</i>

1004
01:23:12,111 --> 01:23:15,405
And I hate myself for saying it.

1005
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:17,871
It's...

1006
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:19,952
It's horrible,

1007
01:23:20,624 --> 01:23:23,085
but you've done this to me.

1008
01:23:25,999 --> 01:23:28,397
You've made me this.

1009
01:23:38,991 --> 01:23:41,454
Yeah, I'm just leaving the house.

1010
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:43,982
Nah, I got held up.
I'll be there in a minute.

1011
01:23:43,983 --> 01:23:49,551
Is the kid coming? Have you got
the plastic top and the shovel?

1012
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,301
Okay.

1013
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,413
Okay.

1014
01:23:55,887 --> 01:23:58,572
Joking.

1015
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,062
So...

1016
01:24:02,063 --> 01:24:04,078
What's this all a fucking 'bout?

1017
01:24:04,463 --> 01:24:06,927
- Team talk?
- Did you threaten her?

1018
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:10,543
- Who?
- Did you go and see her?

1019
01:24:10,544 --> 01:24:12,943
Be man enough to admit it. Did you?

1020
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:17,456
Well, as far as I know,
that's your bag.

1021
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:22,767
Yeah. I put on the siren.
I was here in no time.

1022
01:24:22,768 --> 01:24:25,358
So, let's get to it.

1023
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:30,062
No more small talk. Brass tacks.
Bare bones. To the punch.

1024
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:31,278
Sounds good to me.

1025
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:36,077
Yeah, well, sounds good to the kid?
Gotta run everything by the kid.

1026
01:24:37,134 --> 01:24:39,119
No, I'm serious. We're all here.

1027
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,005
Okay.

1028
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:44,173
So...

1029
01:24:45,295 --> 01:24:47,373
I'm gonna come clean.

1030
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:50,062
But I'm gonna do it in a way

1031
01:24:50,063 --> 01:24:53,421
so that no one else gets
involved or implicated.

1032
01:24:57,198 --> 01:24:59,885
So I've made up my mind.

1033
01:25:00,591 --> 01:25:02,829
<i>So that's what's gonna happen.</i>

1034
01:25:03,727 --> 01:25:06,511
<i>Yeah, well, you sound like you're
trying to convince yourself.</i>

1035
01:25:06,512 --> 01:25:08,623
<i>I just wanted you both to know.</i>

1036
01:25:08,624 --> 01:25:13,006
Yeah, well, now we know. Is that it?

1037
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,597
'Cause that was worth the trip.

1038
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,757
You're a fucking
scared little prick.

1039
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:23,855
<i>- You're piss-weak.</i>
- I'm not gonna bring you into it.

1040
01:25:23,856 --> 01:25:25,455
Oh, sure, like I'm not
gonna get Turkey slapped

1041
01:25:25,456 --> 01:25:29,580
when you drag your little cock
to confession. Piss-weak.

1042
01:25:30,382 --> 01:25:34,030
Oh, yeah, Jim, before you get on your
white horse and ride off into the sunset,

1043
01:25:34,031 --> 01:25:37,358
tell me, because I
really want to know...

1044
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,909
Did you fuck her?
'Cause I hope you did.

1045
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:44,911
Did you do the funky zebra?
Did you make it top deck?

1046
01:25:46,191 --> 01:25:48,463
Because, you know,
if you didn't already,

1047
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:51,183
this'll definitely
get you into the...

1048
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:54,828
Watch out for aids.

1049
01:25:56,623 --> 01:25:57,807
Jim! Jim!

1050
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:02,062
Carl, Carl, Carl!

1051
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:05,743
Jim, let him fucking go.

1052
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,886
- Ah...
- Let go!

1053
01:26:09,295 --> 01:26:10,927
Hey!

1054
01:26:11,983 --> 01:26:15,660
Hey! Oi! Oi, relax!

1055
01:26:16,558 --> 01:26:21,101
Just fucking leave me
alone, for fuck sake. Carl.

1056
01:26:22,063 --> 01:26:23,598
Carl?

1057
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:27,599
- I wasn't choking him. Carl?
- Carl. Carl.

1058
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,127
- Is he alright?
- Oh, fuck, Jim. Get an ambulance.

1059
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:32,015
- What?
- Call an ambulance.

1060
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:33,230
Carl?

1061
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:36,205
- Call a fucking ambulance. Jesus!
- Alright!

1062
01:26:36,206 --> 01:26:40,526
- Carl? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Ambulance, please.

1063
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:43,309
- Carl! Carl!
- Yeah. I...

1064
01:26:50,543 --> 01:26:52,428
Yeah.

1065
01:26:57,519 --> 01:26:59,948
Yeah.

1066
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:05,390
<i>Yeah.</i>

1067
01:27:05,391 --> 01:27:06,958
I'm gonna have to go pretty soon,

1068
01:27:06,959 --> 01:27:10,511
but I'll come back again
and I'll see you tomorrow.

1069
01:27:10,512 --> 01:27:13,999
<i>Good. Yeah.</i>

1070
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,038
- I'm gonna wrap up the whole...
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1071
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:18,895
Nguyen thing.

1072
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:21,902
- Then it'll be over and...
- <i>Yeah. Good.</i>

1073
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:26,157
- Hopefully no more gun fights.
- <i>Good.</i>

1074
01:27:27,087 --> 01:27:30,127
Yeah. Good.

1075
01:27:33,455 --> 01:27:36,399
<i>So I'll see you soon, okay?</i>

1076
01:27:58,511 --> 01:28:00,652
You should go home.

1077
01:28:10,254 --> 01:28:12,940
Listen, I spoke to the doctor.

1078
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:17,037
This thing was gonna happen
regardless, they reckon.

1079
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:20,556
He wasn't much into health.

1080
01:28:34,254 --> 01:28:37,900
You know there's no cameras there
in the back of Tamberine's.

1081
01:28:41,967 --> 01:28:44,364
I don't want him indicted...

1082
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:48,716
Or brought into this
in any way. Okay?

1083
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:52,238
Just give me a couple
of days. That's all I ask.

1084
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,126
Just once tomorrow's done, yeah?

1085
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:56,463
- Hi, Mal.
- Hey, Manny. You okay?

1086
01:28:56,464 --> 01:29:00,493
- Good to see your face.
- Hey, buddy. How are you?

1087
01:31:02,766 --> 01:31:07,150
Hey. Julie and Mel aren't here right now,
please leave a message after the beep.

1088
01:31:23,182 --> 01:31:25,422
<i>Hey, William! Hey, William!</i>

1089
01:32:16,718 --> 01:32:18,894
Hey! Hey!

1090
01:32:18,895 --> 01:32:22,286
Hey! Hey!

1091
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:25,516
Mate! Oi!

1092
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:39,820
<i>Sir, can you hear me?</i>

1093
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:45,708
Sir? Can you hear me?

1094
01:34:46,606 --> 01:34:49,678
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

1095
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,222
<i>Did someone hurt you, sir?
Did someone here hurt you?</i>

1096
01:34:54,223 --> 01:34:55,182
<i>Police.</i>

1097
01:34:56,143 --> 01:34:58,541
<i>Open up. Police.</i>

1098
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:00,206
<i>Yes?</i>

1099
01:35:00,207 --> 01:35:01,742
<i>I called you. I telephoned.</i>

1100
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:04,046
Okay, can you let us
in, please, ma'am?

1101
01:35:04,047 --> 01:35:05,582
- No, no.
- <i>I..I know him.</i>

1102
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:07,406
- Just relax, sir.
- I called you.

1103
01:35:07,407 --> 01:35:09,678
- <i>Who else is here? Anyone else here?</i>
- Just relax here. It's okay.

1104
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,622
- <i>My niece, Nisha.</i>
- She didn't do anything to me.

1105
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:15,566
<i>- It's okay, sir.</i>
- He just came to my door and I called you.

1106
01:35:15,567 --> 01:35:18,766
Okay. I understand.
So do you know this man?

1107
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,774
She didn't do anything to me.

1108
01:35:21,775 --> 01:35:23,022
- Yes, you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

1109
01:35:23,023 --> 01:35:24,558
Do you know what's happened to him?

1110
01:35:24,559 --> 01:35:28,590
She didn't do anything to me.
I just came here.

1111
01:35:28,591 --> 01:35:30,636
It was me.

1112
01:35:31,854 --> 01:35:33,740
I'm sorry.

1113
01:35:36,174 --> 01:35:38,636
I'm so sorry.

1114
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,748
She didn't do anything to me.

1115
01:35:47,982 --> 01:35:51,086
She didn't do anything to me.
I just... it was me.

1116
01:35:51,087 --> 01:35:55,340
<i>Please just leave me.
Just leave me, please.</i>

1117
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:14,510
So you're not feeling dizzy or
anything? Can you hold that for me?

1118
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:17,614
You don't have any
blurred vision? Okay.

1119
01:36:17,615 --> 01:36:23,500
I'm sorry about this, Detective.
She said that you had helped her son.

1120
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:36,460
Just give me a sec.

1121
01:36:41,326 --> 01:36:43,212
You okay?

1122
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:50,924
Come on, sweetie. Whoops.

1123
01:36:51,502 --> 01:36:53,387
Got it?

1124
01:36:53,486 --> 01:36:56,268
A kiss. Mwah.

1125
01:37:05,934 --> 01:37:09,196
- Have a great day, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.

1126
01:37:09,262 --> 01:37:11,148
Okay?

1127
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,638
<i>Bye, Jake!</i>

1128
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,972
<i>See you later!</i>

1129
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:52,620
