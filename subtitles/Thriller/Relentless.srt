1
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:34,829
Was all of it for nothing?

2
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:43,419
See? They didn't accept me.
The psychiatrist said no.

3
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:45,379
l'm not sick.

4
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,055
What do l do now?

5
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,847
Tell me, please, what now?

6
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,752
This is Todd, and l can't come
to the phone right now.

7
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,247
But don't hang up, okay?

8
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,132
l hate these machines
just as much as you do.

9
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:59,380
Anyway, leave a message after the beep,
tell me why you called...

10
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:03,765
and l swear to God l'll call you back, okay?
Wait for the beep.

11
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,430
l called to see if you were home.

12
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,482
l have to kill you tonight.

13
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:58,445
l have to kill you tonight.

14
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,171
This is very auspicious, Dietz.

15
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:10,800
You're removing your uniform
for the very last time.

16
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:13,212
Don't break my balls.

17
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,336
Did you hear that?

18
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:18,263
The guy makes Detective, the first thing
he does is turn on his old friends.

19
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,890
That's not true. l never liked you guys.

20
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,855
-So who's coming?
-Where you going?

21
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,139
-Kelly's.
-You buying?

22
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,397
Yeah, why not?

23
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,893
-Let's bust him.
-Officer Dietz.

24
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:30,489
Yes, Lt. Cardoza.

25
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,152
Get that locker cleared out?

26
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,077
Yes, Lt. Cardoza.

27
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:36,948
Put the show on the road.

28
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,163
Thank you, Lt. Cardoza.

29
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:50,836
Bye, Archie.

30
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:53,515
Adiós, Dietz, good luck.

31
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:57,392
l'm telling you, don't worry about it.
lt's probably just some wacko.

32
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,145
Shit. You Know, that's what l'm afraid of.
Look, l got a tape.

33
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,985
-You want this tape?
-No.

34
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,110
lt's got his voice on it.

35
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,617
Give me the tape.

36
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,908
The investigators will call you
in a couple of days.

37
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:16,082
-You tell them what you told me.
-A couple of days?

38
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,920
We've got a lot of work.
We don't have a lot of people.

39
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:22,089
lt'll take three or four days for them
to get to your report.

40
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,176
Meantime, go home, lock your doors,
go to sleep.

41
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:28,556
lf the guy calls you, call us, all right?

42
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,133
Have a good night.

43
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:05,897
Here.

44
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:14,911
lt's all right.

45
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,868
lt's easy.

46
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,251
Let me help you.

47
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:22,708
There.

48
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,332
lt's over.

49
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,582
What do you feel like for breakfast?

50
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:05,757
Dying.

51
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,347
Come on, wake up.

52
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,098
All right.

53
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,148
Detective Dietz, don't you look handsome?

54
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,444
Corey!

55
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,786
l'd love you to practice,
but not first thing in the morning.

56
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,617
Good morning.

57
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,122
-What are you making?
-Avocado omelette.

58
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,005
How about sausage and peppers?

59
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,505
Sausage and peppers?
Next time your mom and dad come to visit.

60
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,052
Yeah, l don't even have the time.

61
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,261
You got plenty of time, take your vitamins.

62
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:48,350
No, l want to get there early.
lntroduce myself to the guys.

63
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,346
Sam, can you do me a favour?

64
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,139
Just this once, try and remember...

65
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:56,645
that you don't have to set the world on fire
your first day.

66
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,314
l Know, just be myself.

67
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:00,652
No.

68
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:04,735
l said, you don't have
to set the world on fire.

69
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,906
LiKe, be mellow?

70
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,581
Carol, that's so West Coast.

71
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:13,544
-Kid, never marry a girl from the West Coast.
-l don't like girls.

72
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:17,128
Well, don't marry a boy
from the West Coast either.

73
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,878
Avocado omelette up.

74
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:28,727
l gotta go. Be good, l love you.

75
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,890
-My hero, are you nervous?
-No.

76
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,399
A little.

77
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,317
l thought so.

78
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,904
She does that to me all the time, too.

79
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,011
All right, Captain,
l'm working on it right now.

80
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:06,810
-Why don't you quit smoking, too?
-l'm trying.

81
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:13,190
l think, beyond that,
you got to go through Capt. Blakely...

82
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,773
except you don't wanna do that.
He's a jerk-off.

83
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:19,866
You're better off going through
his secretary Francine, over there.

84
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:22,916
This is gonna be your desk.

85
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,753
Just scrape that shit off,
put your stuff in the drawer.

86
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,332
Everybody, listen up.

87
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,377
This is Sam Dietz.
He's gonna be working with me now.

88
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,838
How're you doing?

89
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,520
Nice talking to you.

90
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,518
Nice jacket.

91
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,561
Malloy, homicide. Hollywood.

92
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:50,857
Take the rookie with you.

93
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,733
Rookie?

94
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,698
Come on, let's go.

95
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,163
l got a name, he calls me rookie?

96
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,960
-ls that the jerk-off?
-No, that's another one.

97
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,085
-How many jerk-offs you got around here?
-Got exactly eight.

98
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,921
Hope you don't make nine.

99
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,442
Jeez, standing here reminds me.

100
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,451
Remember that one where
the girl strangled her boyfriend...

101
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,613
with a soap-on-a-rope? Were you on that?

102
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:49,078
No, that was Bob Connely.

103
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,918
l was on that classy one.

104
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,752
The guy drowned his girl in the toilet.

105
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,714
-Yeah! Did you ever break that?
-No.

106
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,219
Take this to the lab.

107
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,925
Who is this guy?

108
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:05,507
Macafee retired. This is my new partner.

109
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,436
Bulldog, what are you doing?

110
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:11,146
-Checking things out.
-Yeah?

111
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,027
Why don't you sniff around out there,
see what you can find?

112
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,029
OKay.

113
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,663
What do you think these condos go for?

114
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,100
Find anything?

115
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,905
That Knife he was Killed with
belonged to the victim.

116
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,862
He's got a whole set of them.

117
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,314
So?

118
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:58,695
So why would he get Killed
with his own steak Knife?

119
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:01,155
Maybe his girlfriend was a vegetarian.

120
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:04,784
His girlfriend wouldn't have to look up
his address and underline it.

121
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,713
Maybe he was a male hooker,
and he stumbled on a burglar.

122
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,748
Burglar? He's got a watch and a ring
in plain sight on the dresser, Malloy.

123
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,802
Maybe the Killer was blind,
but l'll bet you've got a better idea.

124
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,761
Better than a male hooker
with a vegetarian girlfriend...

125
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,344
who finds a blind burglar
in his bathroom, huh?

126
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:24,559
You've been a detective two hours,
you've got all the answers?

127
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,320
Our boys said all the lights were on
in the apartment.

128
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,855
-So the stiff was afraid of the dark.
-He sure was last night.

129
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,196
Now look...

130
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,742
the shower curtain's pulled back.

131
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,494
That's not the way he normally Kept it.

132
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,533
You're probably wondering
how l figured that out.

133
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,166
lf you Keep a plastic shower curtain
pulled back...

134
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,249
you get mildew in the folds.

135
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,047
No mildew.

136
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,584
How about that?

137
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,547
Now, this other thing is just a guess.

138
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,390
But l'm saying,
Todd comes into the apartment...

139
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,973
he thinks somebody else is here.

140
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:01,148
He gets a Knife,
turns on all the lights, he comes in here.

141
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,265
He's looking.

142
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,147
-He pulls the shower curtain back--
-Hold it.

143
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,113
He was behind the curtain.

144
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:11,494
You can practically see through this.
You can't hide behind something like that.

145
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,655
So where did he come from?

146
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,123
From out there.

147
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,742
Todd pulls it back, he doesn't find anybody.

148
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:21,086
He turns around, the Killer comes
through the door, they scuffle.

149
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:23,130
Todd goes down just like that.

150
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,177
What do you think? This is a joke?

151
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:36,932
Would you excuse us, please?

152
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,985
Let me tell you something
about police work.

153
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:46,240
All that stuff you just figured out
so brilliantly is bullshit.

154
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,363
That's okay, because
most of what we do is bullshit.

155
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:52,871
But the bullshit that you just dumped on us
is useless bullshit.

156
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,453
lt doesn't help us.

157
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,461
Thanks for your advice, old-timer.

158
00:18:56,546 --> 00:19:00,082
Knock off the old-timer stuff.
l don't want a snot-nose for a partner.

159
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,587
Don't tell me l'm not helping.

160
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:05,510
You're not helping us. You wanna help us?
Tell us who the fuck this guy is!

161
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:08,683
What the fuck is with the phone book?
Who the fuck Killed him?

162
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,845
How the fuck do l Know? lt's my first day.

163
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:12,895
That's right, it's your first day.

164
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,473
We all acted that way on our first day.

165
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:19,319
lt's sort of a tradition.
Come on, let's get something to eat.

166
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,568
Eat?

167
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:24,072
l think that we ought to get
something to eat.

168
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:27,328
We wait for the lab report,
the autopsy, the prints.

169
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,123
Then we make with the theories.

170
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,664
l just feel like we ought
to be doing something.

171
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,663
LiKe interrogating someone?

172
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,333
Yeah?

173
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,251
Excuse me.

174
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,931
What exactly was your relationship
to the deceased?

175
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,429
All right.

176
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,801
We eat.

177
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,650
Hello?

178
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:13,997
Los Angeles Police Department.
We're sorry, all available lines are busy.

179
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,007
Stay on the line.
An officer will answer your call...

180
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:19,251
in the order in which it was received.

181
00:23:19,345 --> 00:23:23,675
Thank you. This message will repeat
until an officer is available to help you.

182
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:30,309
Police Emergency. This is Officer Rosko.
May l help you?

183
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,650
Yes, l'd like to report a prowler.
l believe l heard somebody....

184
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:35,065
Oh, my God!

185
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,914
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?

186
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,085
Hello? Ma'am?

187
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,006
ls it an emergency?
Are you having a medical emergency?

188
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,253
Hello?

189
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,461
Do you need help, ma'am?

190
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:58,962
Hello? Are you still on the line?

191
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,887
Ma'am, l'm sending a unit out right away.

192
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:02,316
No!

193
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,087
Yeah, take it.

194
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:20,842
That's it.

195
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,009
lt's easy.

196
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:26,761
See?

197
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:31,593
Yes.

198
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,072
lsn't that better?

199
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:04,591
So we went to the bathroom,
and the body is lying on the floor...

200
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:05,882
with a note on the chest.

201
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:07,887
Do we have to discuss this at dinner?

202
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:09,226
Sorry.

203
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,897
-Dinner's great.
-How's the roast?

204
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:15,186
Are you Kidding me?
Red meat instead of tofu?

205
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,438
l think l died and went to heaven.

206
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,739
Well, it's a special occasion.

207
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,194
lt's your first dinner as a dick.

208
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:24,122
What's a dick?

209
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,909
That's another word for detective.

210
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,458
How was your day?

211
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:34,047
Thank you for asking.
lt was very good. l picked up a new client.

212
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,582
No Kidding.

213
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,050
A little restaurant on Union, the Rathskeller.

214
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,926
They need a dozen ferns
and a couple of trees.

215
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,761
lt's gonna be cute.

216
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,260
Ferns? That's great.

217
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,601
All right. Sam, what happened then?

218
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,447
All right, so l'm trying
to piece this thing together...

219
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:54,729
get some clues.

220
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:58,775
This clown, all he wants to do is stand
around and wait for the report to come in.

221
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,115
That sounds reasonable.

222
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,159
That's not how we did it in New York.

223
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:06,577
Honey, maybe that's how they do it in LA.

224
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:28,562
Did we check the basement?
This broken window here?

225
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,904
Son of a bitch!

226
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:36,573
-What time?
-Dispatch got the call at 6:48.

227
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,950
They traced it here 6:52.
First wheels got here about 7:22.

228
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:42,035
Come on. Did you get a load of this place?

229
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,702
l bet it's worth $2.5 million
if it's worth a nickel.

230
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:46,257
Come on, what have we got here?

231
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:50,422
We got ourselves a stiff: Angela Taylor,
Caucasian, age 39. Occupation: songwriter.

232
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:53,680
l actually caught her on
The Cosby Show once plugging her stuff.

233
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,261
She was a great-looking broad.

234
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,640
Anyway, the guy comes in
through the skylight...

235
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:00,647
chases her downstairs,
strangles her with a piano wire...

236
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,856
-he sticks her in a dryer.
-No, he didn't.

237
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,482
-He found her in the dryer.
-What, no mildew again?

238
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:08,145
No, she Kicked the shit out of the insides.

239
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:21,211
-You got anything over there?
-Not so far, l haven't.

240
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:24,004
Malloy, could you refresh
my memory again?

241
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,465
Now tell me,
what exactly are we waiting for?

242
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:30,014
What you always wait for
in a goddamn homicide.

243
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,134
An eyewitness, a confession or
the accumulation of a shitload of evidence.

244
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:37,563
-How about a sign from God?
-What, are you getting wise with me?

245
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:40,687
Look, can l talk to you for a second?
Over here.

246
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,817
Let's go over here, away from all this.

247
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,117
What's up? l wanna get the hell out of here.

248
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,411
Malloy, let me tell you something.

249
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,958
When l was on the force in New York,
we caught the Son of Sam.

250
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,325
You Know how we caught him?

251
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,624
500 guys busting their tail
in 500 directions around the clock.

252
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,801
One poor schlub had to check out
all the parking violations...

253
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,129
written near the murders
on the slim chance...

254
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,841
that the motherfucker was parked illegally
while he was Killing people.

255
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:11,343
Then we had other poor schlubs,
myself included...

256
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:14,356
who had to follow up
every one of those fucking tickets...

257
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,692
and believe me, we thought
it was one jack shit waste of time...

258
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:20,067
until two of our guys from Yonkers
found him.

259
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,948
And they busted that son of a bitch.

260
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,866
So don't give me this stand-around-and-wait
bullshit, 'cause l don't buy it.

261
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,449
l Know where you're coming from.

262
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,158
You think we're dragging our asses,
you wanna do something constructive.

263
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:33,245
-You're right.
-Shit, okay.

264
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:37,041
Capt. Blakely's gonna want a report
first thing in the morning.

265
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:38,961
What do you say you take that on?

266
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:41,670
-Yeah, it's better than nothing.
-OKay, great.

267
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:44,338
Just make sure it's good,
because Capt. Blakely...

268
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:47,305
Jesus, he's got high standards,
just like you.

269
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,282
-How's it going?
-Good.

270
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:08,301
You've got a great big Knot back here.

271
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,135
What's the matter?

272
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,849
This thing tonight, this Taylor woman...

273
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:16,397
she tries to hide, right?

274
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:20,315
Two feet from her is a toolbox
with hammers, chisels, screwdrivers.

275
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:22,609
She could have beat the guy
to a bloody pulp.

276
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:24,773
lnstead she crawls inside of the dryer.

277
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:27,399
Not everybody is a fighter.

278
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:31,362
l Know that, Carol, but if you act like
a victim, you're gonna be a victim.

279
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,960
What's really bothering you?

280
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,007
l really wanna do my job,
and this guy's not letting me.

281
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,181
lf you wanna do it so bad,
you're going about it the wrong way.

282
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,548
But he's making me crazy.

283
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:52,396
l can't seem to convince him
to let me do what l can do.

284
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:56,269
You didn't tell him the Son of Sam story,
did you?

285
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:03,193
You Know what you need?

286
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:04,733
What?

287
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:10,407
Come on, Carol, it's late.

288
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:16,757
Every time that you feel frustrated
by Malloy...

289
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:20,460
l want you to say something nasty
to the plant.

290
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:23,888
lnsult it, threaten its little life...

291
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:27,889
and pretty soon it's going to be droopy...

292
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:30,055
the leaves are gonna get brown.

293
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,442
You're gonna feel like
you really accomplished something.

294
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,900
-Get it out.
-No, come on.

295
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,903
Now you try it. Give it your best shot, Sam.
Go ahead. Go on.

296
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,238
You eat shit.

297
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,074
That's not an insult to a plant.

298
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,253
l hope you get root rot, you little fuck.

299
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,594
That's good. That's very good.

300
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,384
l think l almost saw it
starting to cringe there.

301
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,770
l think l'm going
to finish this report in the morning.

302
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:20,280
Very good idea.

303
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,072
Come in.

304
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,049
This report is excellent.

305
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:33,419
-You type this, Malloy?
-No, sir.

306
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,013
Detective Dietz typed it.

307
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:40,477
This is good. This is real good.

308
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:42,563
Nice margins.

309
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,190
Did you see this morning's Times?

310
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,603
''Police hunt Sunset Killer.''

311
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,193
You didn't give them that, did you?

312
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:54,952
No, sir.

313
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:58,994
All we told them was that there was
no definite link between the Killings.

314
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,537
The fact that they took place
near Sunset Boulevard at sunset.

315
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,380
-Coincidence.
-What about the phone book thing?

316
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,339
We didn't tell them that.

317
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,217
We were afraid of a copycat.

318
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,509
This lunatic is trying to show the world...

319
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:15,298
that he can pick anybody at random
from a phone book and Kill them...

320
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,053
and make us look like idiots.

321
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:20,230
l'd just as soon the world
didn't get that message.

322
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,107
So let's Keep a lid on it, okay?

323
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,687
Excuse me, Captain.

324
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,316
A little publicity might be just what
we need here.

325
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:29,490
Those people are dead
because they did exactly the wrong thing.

326
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:30,987
Maybe we should tell people.

327
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:33,366
lf they think someone's in their home,
get out.

328
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:36,077
Don't go looking, don't make phone calls,
don't hide.

329
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,661
Get out, then call us.

330
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,744
Maybe we could save some lives that way.

331
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:44,215
Maybe you'd like to work the switchboard
when we get 100,000 calls a night...

332
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,757
to help little old ladies
into their apartments.

333
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,589
You're exaggerating a little bit.

334
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,089
Look, Dietz, if you argue with me...

335
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:53,757
you're gonna find yourself
working the airport.

336
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,514
Now, until l say otherwise,
we Keep a lid on it.

337
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,560
Understand? Get out!

338
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,897
You Know what to do.

339
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,479
No, Captain, l don't Know what to do.

340
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:06,567
Try catching the son of a bitch.

341
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:14,705
Fucking moron.

342
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:17,000
He's the jerk-off. You're the fucking moron.

343
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:20,173
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to take the jerk-off's advice.

344
00:37:23,804 --> 00:37:26,093
He can't help it, he's from New York.

345
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:29,050
-What's that?
-lt's jaywalking.

346
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:32,687
The other one, the Taylor woman?
She's clean.

347
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:36,148
Has either of them
ever been under investigation for anything?

348
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:37,266
No.

349
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,398
ln both instances, it appears
that the victims were forced...

350
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,233
to participate in their own deaths.

351
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:46,275
The wide Knife-entry wound on Mr. Arthur's
body indicates a definite struggle.

352
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:50,655
As you can see, there are minute traces
of latex we found on the piano wire.

353
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,040
So we figured
he was wearing rubber gloves.

354
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:54,837
That's why there were no prints.

355
00:37:56,966 --> 00:38:00,300
Francine, is there like a police psychiatrist
or somebody like that?

356
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:02,296
You've only been on the job two days.

357
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:04,216
-lt's not for me.
-l Know.

358
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:06,515
-You want it for a friend.
-Yeah.

359
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,517
l love you, don't ever change.

360
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,703
Dr. ParK? This is Detective Dietz, LAPD.

361
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:33,581
l'd say that this guy is seriously fucked up.

362
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,465
At last, somebody who speaks my language.

363
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:39,138
So what else?

364
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:43,221
Two notes aren't
a hell of a lot to go on, really.

365
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:46,888
These would indicate he's a taunter.

366
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,558
Extremely self-confident.

367
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:52,560
Very successful at whatever he attempts.

368
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:56,607
And he doesn't mind telling you
just how successful he is.

369
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,862
You think we're gonna hear from him?

370
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:01,409
Without finding a body attached
to one of those?

371
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:05,746
Probable, if Killing simply for the sake
of Killing begins to bore him.

372
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:09,080
Then you're saying
that there's gonna be more.

373
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:10,917
Unfortunately, yeah.

374
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:14,801
You might wanna consider the victims.

375
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:18,467
A movie extra and a songwriter.

376
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,684
They're industry-related.

377
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:24,225
l'm sorry, l'm getting into your territory now.

378
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:26,808
Believe me, l could use the help.

379
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,859
lt's a tough one, Dietz.

380
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,858
Maybe he's just crazy.

381
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,409
l could have said that.

382
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,155
But l get paid for it.

383
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,703
No, Carol, you go ahead and eat.
l don't Know how late l'll be.

384
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:46,297
Yeah, l'm trying to.

385
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:49,543
All right, l love you, too.

386
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,701
l thought we discussed this.

387
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,245
What are you doing still dressed?

388
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,364
Arthur, you are my boss.

389
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:22,457
OKay, let's see what's hidden
behind door Number 1 .

390
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:25,461
Looky, what have we got here?

391
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:28,337
Here's a little something for you.

392
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,266
l'll go get something for the both of us.

393
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:33,845
Phone rings, don't answer it.

394
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:40,018
Arthur, don't take too long.

395
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,984
She's hot to trot.

396
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,329
$25.99.

397
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,883
l'll write it off.

398
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,183
Yes!

399
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,946
Arthur, what's taking so long?

400
00:41:23,117 --> 00:41:25,359
Don't be afraid. l'll help you.

401
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:35,582
lt's easy.

402
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,131
Yes.

403
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,695
Arthur, l'm waiting!

404
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,331
Get in here now, Arthur!

405
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:19,471
l want you now.

406
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,475
You take too long, Arthur.

407
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:32,147
lf you want me now, you'll have to force me.

408
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,270
See?

409
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,607
You did it.

410
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:12,532
That's good.

411
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:32,586
Ernie! How are you?

412
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:34,674
Can you give me something for the 1 1 :00?

413
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,475
l'll snoop around and let you Know.

414
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,849
-Carmen, you look beautiful.
-Hiya, cutie.

415
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:41,893
What does a condo like this go for?
$100,000?

416
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:49,902
Hey, early bird. Who's the mystery victim?

417
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:53,495
Read this. No clues, no nothing.

418
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,869
-What is it?
-The asshole left it.

419
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,376
You're Kidding.

420
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:01,120
''Where are police
when you really need them?''

421
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:02,293
Funny.

422
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:06,047
-Funny. Heard there was a girl.
-Yeah, and our friend Killed her, too.

423
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:09,172
Look, l hope you don't think
this is useless bullshit...

424
00:44:09,264 --> 00:44:11,969
-but isn't there something strange?
-Hold on a second.

425
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:14,512
-Arthur Taylor?
-Yeah.

426
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:16,688
Todd Arthur.

427
00:44:16,773 --> 00:44:19,691
Angela Taylor.
lt's as plain as the nose on your face.

428
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:20,891
What is?

429
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:24,569
Arthur Taylor. This is the guy
we're really after. Come on.

430
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:26,697
Let's go talk to the news people.

431
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:30,201
Anybody talks to you, just say,
''No habla inglés. ''

432
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:32,746
-Yeah, sure.
-Good Kid.

433
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:37,791
Just hold off on the name thing
for 48 hours...

434
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,169
and l promise to give you
everything we've got.

435
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:42,167
What time did the attack take place?

436
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:44,301
-What time?
-7:15.

437
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:47,013
Who are you Kidding?

438
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,100
You won't go on record
that this was another Sunset murder?

439
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:52,475
No comment.
You're calling it that, we're not.

440
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:54,390
Does this look like Sunset Boulevard?

441
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,559
What are you trying to do? Start a panic?

442
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:58,894
-Do you have a description of him?
-No.

443
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,728
Shit!

444
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,198
What are you so grumpy about?

445
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,691
l think you're wrong.
And you don't wanna listen.

446
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:05,948
This guy is a psychopath.

447
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,113
l'm not arguing with you.
He's a psychopath.

448
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,410
-No, l don't think he's gonna stop.
-He'll stop when we nail him.

449
00:45:11,502 --> 00:45:15,001
-You just don't give a shit!
-Who the hell is raining on your parade?

450
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:16,881
You are, man.

451
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:20,715
Sam?

452
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:30,973
You think l handled that well?

453
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:36,320
l love you.
What do you want me to say? No?

454
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:40,024
l felt like punching the guy's lights out
because he just won't listen.

455
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:41,695
Have you tried being reasonable?

456
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:45,037
l mean, just sitting him down
and discussing it calmly with him?

457
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:46,534
Sure, you Know me.

458
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:50,121
Yes, l do Know you,
and that's why l'm asking.

459
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:53,796
We've been through
this same thing before, remember?

460
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:56,256
No, that was different.
Cardoza was a jerk-off.

461
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:58,384
You said that this new guy is a jerk-off.

462
00:45:58,472 --> 00:45:59,966
That's a different jerk-off.

463
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,391
Until you learn
how to deal with these jerk-offs...

464
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:05,891
you're never gonna get what you want, Sam.

465
00:46:06,606 --> 00:46:09,524
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, you little snoop.

466
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,983
-Hi, Dad.
-What are you doing out of bed?

467
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:16,280
l couldn't sleep.
l want to hear you tell what you did today.

468
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,775
Story time's over.
Why don't you go back to bed?

469
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,949
No.

470
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,698
-Corey, darling--
-l'll handle this.

471
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:25,578
You're looking for a Knuckle sandwich
if you don't move.

472
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:28,119
Good job, boss.

473
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:31,417
Sweetheart, l Know that you love to hear
your daddy's stories...

474
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:36,136
but it's not polite to listen to people talk
when they don't Know you're there, is it?

475
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:40,385
But we'll forgive you, if you'll run off...

476
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:43,051
get right back into bed
and have sweet dreams, okay?

477
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:45,271
-Night-night, honey.
-Good night.

478
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:50,566
Reasonable.

479
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:53,695
-l could have done that.
-Do it with Malloy.

480
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:58,117
l'll buy him some Roger Rabbit jammies.

481
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,614
Dad, what's a jerk-off?

482
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:02,914
Ask your mother.

483
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:04,663
Mom, what's a jerk-off?

484
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:06,711
Bed!

485
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:11,714
Don't give me nougies.
You go bald that way.

486
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:19,877
Yeah?

487
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:23,045
lf you say, ''l told you so,''
l'll bust you in the chops.

488
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:27,090
-He hit again last night. Twice.
-What?

489
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,885
Yeah. l just got the call.
Connely's already on it.

490
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:34,182
- ou there?
-Yeah.

491
00:48:36,276 --> 00:48:38,103
Why don't l come by and pick you up?

492
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,814
You wanna pick me up? Why?

493
00:48:42,157 --> 00:48:44,565
You Know, carpools save energy.

494
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:46,828
Give us a chance to talk.

495
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:50,958
OKay, bulldog.
Guess what the two stiffs had in common?

496
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:52,581
What?

497
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:55,420
They're both named Arthur Taylor.

498
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:02,172
We made the papers.

499
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,769
''Hollywood division detectives
Bill Malloy and Sam Dietz...

500
00:49:08,854 --> 00:49:12,354
''refused to disclose anything
regarding the double murder at the scene.

501
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:15,978
''Police officials will neither confirm
nor deny...

502
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:20,069
''that this latest crime
was the work of the so-called Sunset killer.

503
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:28,667
''But Detective Malloy did call the murders.:

504
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:32,168
'''the senseless acts of a sick mind. '''

505
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:42,093
By the way...

506
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:45,644
l understand the nutcase pen pal
sent us a hot note.

507
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,761
What?

508
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:49,394
Something like,
''l'm getting closer, are you?''

509
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:53,279
How many more Arthur Taylors
are there in the phone book?

510
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:56,780
-l'm way ahead of you.
-Maybe we should see if they're still alive.

511
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,445
l already called it in.

512
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:01,656
lf they are, we ought to tell them
Tijuana is nice at this time.

513
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,491
That's a good idea.

514
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,869
Malloy, one other thing.
lt's been bothering me a little bit.

515
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,750
l don't wanna spit
in the face of modern science...

516
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,758
and l don't wanna challenge
your authority or experience...

517
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,133
but l think it's time we take after this guy.

518
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,594
l Knew this couldn't last. Jesus Christ.

519
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:21,301
What do we Know about him?
He's good at breaking in and Killing.

520
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:24,480
Why don't we get a couple
poor schlubs, like in the old days...

521
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:25,976
sit down at a file cabinet...

522
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:30,564
start pulling jackets on murders, assaults,
burglaries, prowlers, escaped lunatics?

523
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:33,740
How about escaped lunatics
with parking tickets?

524
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:40,488
My wife is going to be very upset
if this reasonable crap doesn't work.

525
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,452
-Your wife is going to be upset?
-Yes. Come on, give me a break.

526
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:46,669
All right, Kiddo.

527
00:50:46,757 --> 00:50:49,759
l'll call Capt. Blakely.
He'll recruit us some slubs.

528
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:53,470
-Not slubs. Schlubs!
-Whatever.

529
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:10,946
-Arthur Taylor?
-Yeah.

530
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:15,112
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Do you mind if we come in?

531
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:21,211
-Do l have any what?
-Any enemies, Mr. Taylor.

532
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:24,666
-Do you have any enemies?
-Hell, yes, l got enemies.

533
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:27,084
l got hundreds of them,
probably even thousands.

534
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:29,088
l wouldn't even Know where to begin.

535
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,182
-You want some prunes?
-No, thanks. Never touch them.

536
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,593
For a man your age,
they're very good for you.

537
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:37,471
Mr. Taylor, we don't wanna upset you...

538
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:40,483
but maybe there's somebody
you could stay with for a while.

539
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:43,985
-Are there people you could stay with?
-You mean broads?

540
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,564
How about family?
l'll bet they'd love to have you.

541
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,653
You Know something? You're an asshole.

542
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:53,867
And you're full of shit.

543
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,663
And you're a bastard.

544
00:52:05,597 --> 00:52:06,712
What the hell?

545
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:09,843
Now that we Know each other,
l may as well throw up my hands.

546
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,679
-l'll go.
-Attaboy.

547
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,148
Yeah, I'm telling you.
Real estate in LA went up 30% last year.

548
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:20,066
-That house is worth $200,000, minimum.
-For that Kind of money back east...

549
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:22,907
you get a lot more
than a little house with no backyard.

550
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:24,071
Back east, my ass.

551
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,280
You like it so much there,
why don't you buy this grumpy place?

552
00:52:27,372 --> 00:52:31,536
Living in a tenement like this would make
you feel right back in the Big Apple.

553
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:34,117
lt's open.

554
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:37,834
Arthur Taylor?

555
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:53,056
Look, we're police officers.
Can we talk to you for a minute?

556
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:54,896
Sorry to wake you up.

557
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:58,649
There's a possibility
you may be in some danger.

558
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:01,571
Do you have any enemies,
anybody who would harm you?

559
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,740
What?

560
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:04,738
Do you have any enemies?

561
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:06,915
Am l in danger?

562
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,954
Someone's been Killing people
with the same name as you.

563
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:12,881
Maybe you saw somebody following you,
or hanging around.

564
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:14,579
No, sir.

565
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,040
Just the same...

566
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:19,718
is there somebody you can stay with
for a while, just until we catch him?

567
00:53:20,474 --> 00:53:21,884
Why can't you catch him?

568
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:24,178
Believe me, we're trying.

569
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,595
When you catch him,
what are you gonna do?

570
00:53:26,689 --> 00:53:28,598
That's for the courts to decide.

571
00:53:28,691 --> 00:53:30,483
You're gonna Kill him, aren't you?

572
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:34,565
Ike Taylor? Jesus Christ, Ike!

573
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:36,943
Little Buck.

574
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:39,077
You're not Buck, are you?

575
00:53:42,123 --> 00:53:45,374
Goddamn, Ike Taylor! Hell of a cop!

576
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:48,618
lnspirational.

577
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:50,671
That's right, a real inspiration.

578
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:53,881
What a guy.

579
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:57,765
-How come you're not on the job?
-They wouldn't take me.

580
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:00,519
They wouldn't take you, Ike Taylor's kid?
Their loss.

581
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,098
Buck. lt's Buck, right?

582
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,152
Boy, this is some cannon you got.

583
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:14,114
You Keep it real nice and clean.

584
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:16,571
You got a license for it?

585
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:20,451
Yeah, sure you do.

586
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,829
So you say you got no people
you can stay with for a few days?

587
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:28,005
l'm a police officer,
and l can't advise you to use this weapon.

588
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:31,259
But if you're staying here....
Let me put it this way.

589
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,932
l Keep mine right in that drawer,
right next to my bed.

590
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:37,726
You Know what l'm saying?

591
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,439
l don't wanna freak you out.
He's just very dangerous.

592
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:47,735
Dangerous? He's a fucking maniac.

593
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:52,863
lf you need us,
you can call us at this number.

594
00:54:54,872 --> 00:54:57,446
You ask for me, Detective Dietz,
or Detective Malloy.

595
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,784
Dietz, and you're Malloy.

596
00:55:00,337 --> 00:55:02,211
Bill Malloy. Kid, come here.

597
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:08,381
-You need anything, you call me. All right?
-Yes, sir.

598
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,673
Buck, you grew up.

599
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,974
-You Keep your door closed from now on.
-Yes, sir.

600
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:24,852
l hope he'll be all right.

601
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:27,190
Any son of Ike Taylor
can take care of himself.

602
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:29,989
He was the meanest,
toughest son of a bitch l ever met.

603
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,490
So what ever happened to him?

604
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:35,199
Liberals said that we had to start burping
the criminals that we nailed.

605
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:38,129
They said that Ike was too dangerous
for the streets.

606
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,624
So Ike said, ''Fuck it.''

607
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,380
Don't look at me like that.

608
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:22,847
lt's not my fault the cops are stupid.

609
00:56:26,602 --> 00:56:27,977
What do you want from me?

610
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:36,017
Listen.

611
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,042
No?

612
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:05,885
Fuck.

613
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,438
You're right.

614
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:15,614
You're always right.

615
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,245
Not this way.

616
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,657
They have to do it.

617
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:28,918
Let's just say l heard about you
and Lt. Cardoza not getting along.

618
00:57:29,006 --> 00:57:31,462
lt's just that l worked for him
for three years...

619
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,124
during which he tried
to get me thrown off the force.

620
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,257
-Yeah? Did he have a good reason?
-Yeah, he's a rat bastard.

621
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:40,220
No shit. Also a pretty goddamn good cop.

622
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,350
Sure. All you old farts stick together.

623
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:46,353
Hey, wise guy. l'm tired of
all this bullshit about an old man.

624
00:57:46,776 --> 00:57:48,650
Go find a younger fucking partner.

625
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:52,987
-Bill, l'm sorry.
-Balls.

626
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:57,073
Look, give me a break.
l don't wanna be jerk-off Number 9.

627
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:00,906
Come on.

628
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,170
-How's it going?
-How's it look, gramps?

629
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:10,925
-What did you say?
-You're a little testy there, aren't you, man?

630
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,088
l'd like to meet the brain donor
who came up with this bullshit idea.

631
00:58:15,183 --> 00:58:17,853
You're looking at him.
You don't like it, Kiss my ass.

632
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:21,641
All right, come on. Girls, easy!

633
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:25,099
Come on.

634
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:27,605
What my partner meant to say was...

635
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:30,818
you're doing a fine job,
and we Know it's thankless and boring.

636
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:34,285
But we're depending on you.
So please, stay with it, okay?

637
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,412
Yeah, okay.

638
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:40,708
-What's your name?
-Terrell.

639
00:58:40,796 --> 00:58:42,788
lt's nice to meet you, Terrell.

640
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:46,462
Hang in there.

641
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:53,721
When this case is over,
l'm gonna rip his lungs out.

642
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,720
Fuck him and the horse he rode in on.

643
00:58:57,022 --> 00:58:58,303
What are you laughing at?

644
00:58:58,399 --> 00:59:01,566
Shit. Underneath it all,
you're just as big an asshole as l am.

645
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:05,271
Yeah, but l hide it better than you.
You're a bad influence on me.

646
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:07,821
-How's that?
-You're making me give a damn.

647
00:59:17,713 --> 00:59:19,836
There's about 1 2 million people in LA...

648
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,593
and a million of them
are bona fide committable.

649
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:25,844
And out of that million,
200,000 are probably dangerous.

650
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:30,595
And of that 200,000, one of them decides
it's open season on people.

651
00:59:30,686 --> 00:59:34,387
One of them, Sam, against you and me.
But we're gonna find him.

652
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:27,198
Sam, here. Take a look at this.

653
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:32,084
-That's you and Lasorda!
-Yeah.

654
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:35,458
lt's the annual police benevolent game
at Dodger Stadium.

655
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:37,840
l got no hits and a plate of pasta.

656
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:39,805
That's a great shot, man.

657
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,850
-What position did you play?
-Third base.

658
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:45,342
Yeah?

659
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:49,518
-Can you still make that throw?
-Better when they moved me to second.

660
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:51,644
lt was humiliating.

661
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:55,068
To baseball, the ultimate game.

662
01:00:55,615 --> 01:00:56,730
l used to like it.

663
01:00:57,743 --> 01:01:00,828
What do you mean, used to?
Baseball is like life.

664
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:05,123
l'm a track horse rounding third base,
trying to slide home safe.

665
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:07,707
And you're trying to make rookie of the year.

666
01:01:08,422 --> 01:01:09,501
l did love it.

667
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:12,124
l used to sit in the bleachers with my father.

668
01:01:12,218 --> 01:01:15,587
Campy, the Duke. l Knew 'em all.
You Know my favourite? Gil Hodges.

669
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,512
He used to hit a home run, he'd cross
home plate and blow his wife a Kiss.

670
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:22,519
l loved them so much,
and then they fucking moved to LA.

671
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:23,850
They broke my heart.

672
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:25,809
Son of a bitch.

673
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,524
That's why you have a hard-on against LA.

674
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,108
You Know what you gotta do?
You gotta see a ball game.

675
01:01:32,574 --> 01:01:34,282
-No.
-Yeah, you do.

676
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:40,956
l got two tickets. Opening day.
Third base line, right behind the dugout.

677
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,450
You come with me.
l'll introduce you to Lasorda.

678
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:48,883
l gotta go home. l appreciate the offer.
l'll see you in the morning.

679
01:01:54,432 --> 01:01:57,006
You and me, opening day? You're on.

680
01:01:58,353 --> 01:01:59,682
Right, you're on.

681
01:02:00,147 --> 01:02:03,730
You Know, Malloy,
l always had you figured for a catcher.

682
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:06,434
l catch a lot of shit from you, that's for sure.

683
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:58,413
What are you doing here?

684
01:03:03,427 --> 01:03:04,803
Come on in.

685
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:07,090
Close the door behind you.

686
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:10,806
Just getting myself a beer.

687
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:14,938
How did you find my address?

688
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:18,604
ln the phone book.

689
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:26,533
My father said l was sick...

690
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:28,951
once.

691
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,129
Sir...

692
01:03:45,308 --> 01:03:46,637
what's it like?

693
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,615
Corey.

694
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:12,952
Time-out.

695
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:15,088
Why don't you help your mother
with dinner?

696
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:16,290
l don't want to.

697
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,173
When l was a Kid,
l used to help my mother with dinner.

698
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,717
That way, l made sure
l got the smallest portion of spinach.

699
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,552
-You Know what l'm saying?
-OKay.

700
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:36,822
-Would you chop up these cucumbers?
-No problem.

701
01:04:40,454 --> 01:04:41,617
Hello?

702
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:44,704
Just a moment. Sam, it's for you.

703
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:51,706
Carol, this reasonable stuff, it works.

704
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:57,339
-Yeah?
-Dietz, it's Blakely. Malloy's been killed.

705
01:04:57,432 --> 01:04:59,757
-How?
-Shot in the heart.

706
01:05:00,894 --> 01:05:02,436
No. l just left him.

707
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,985
ou better get over there right away.

708
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,691
Yeah, l'll be right there.

709
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,457
Somebody Killed Malloy.

710
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,002
-Oh, my God. Do you think it has anything--
-No, there was no note.

711
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,759
You and Corey should spend the night
at your mother's.

712
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:29,957
No.

713
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:32,626
-We don't Know what this guy might do.
-We don't.

714
01:05:32,722 --> 01:05:35,723
l'm not gonna run and hide
every time a criminal is loose...

715
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:37,552
just because you're on the case.

716
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:41,183
All right. Stay inside,
make sure everything's locked.

717
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:42,981
You Know where the gun is.

718
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:54,944
Shit!

719
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,828
What does that mean?

720
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,411
Malloy called the guy sick
in the newspapers.

721
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:04,080
Pack a bag. You're going to your mother's.

722
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:07,092
Do it! lt's just for tonight.
You come back in the morning.

723
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:20,564
You're a dead man.
You're a fucking dead man.

724
01:06:50,894 --> 01:06:52,851
Here's the MO report, sir.

725
01:07:21,554 --> 01:07:24,721
-l'm really sorry about Bill.
-l Know you are.

726
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:28,434
Carmen, l need your help.

727
01:07:28,937 --> 01:07:30,182
All right.

728
01:07:30,355 --> 01:07:33,226
But what l'm gonna tell you
is against the rules.

729
01:07:38,406 --> 01:07:41,242
Corey, go get your schoolbooks.

730
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:45,913
-Good morning.
-You got the paper?

731
01:07:49,502 --> 01:07:51,910
lf it's safe now,
why wasn't it safe last night?

732
01:07:52,005 --> 01:07:53,250
He doesn't work days.

733
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:56,253
She did it.

734
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:58,753
-What?
-Listen to this.

735
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:02,839
''ln the wake of last night's murder
of LAPD detective Sergeant Bill Malloy...

736
01:08:02,934 --> 01:08:06,553
''police psychologist Dr. Lyndon ParK
has provided a profile of the Killer.

737
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:10,312
''He's an anally fixated, sexually impotent,
socially inept individual...

738
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:11,599
''who's using homicide...

739
01:08:11,694 --> 01:08:15,277
''as a means of hiding his own feelings
of inadequacy or worthlessness.''

740
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:17,939
l can't believe that
a psychologist would say that.

741
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,119
l just hope he believes it.

742
01:08:20,245 --> 01:08:22,487
And you'll probably be there
waiting for him.

743
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:24,405
Praying for him.

744
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,049
Keep your eyes open.
Let's catch this psycho.

745
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:35,089
-Can l talk to you?
-Dietz, l was just gonna call you.

746
01:08:35,638 --> 01:08:37,465
Your new partner's Wicker.

747
01:08:37,557 --> 01:08:40,724
He's got something on Fairfax, go with him.

748
01:08:42,813 --> 01:08:45,980
-What about the Sunset murders?
-You're not working that anymore.

749
01:08:46,066 --> 01:08:47,098
See Wicker.

750
01:08:47,485 --> 01:08:49,857
What do you mean,
l'm not working that anymore?

751
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:53,029
l mean, the shit hit the fan.

752
01:08:53,116 --> 01:08:56,817
l'm turning it over to some guys
who have more than three days' experience.

753
01:08:56,912 --> 01:08:58,988
-Would you listen to me for a second?
-No.

754
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,619
l have to put together a task force
this morning...

755
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:03,536
for a news conference this afternoon.

756
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:07,211
l don't care about news conferences,
because l need men for a stakeout.

757
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:10,502
You don't need men, l need men.
You need ears.

758
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:13,928
Now for the last time,
get the hell out of my office!

759
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:48,792
Sam Dietz? Art Wicker.

760
01:09:49,722 --> 01:09:53,388
Dr. ParK, this is Dietz.
l'm leaving for your house right now.

761
01:09:54,477 --> 01:09:55,722
Dietz?

762
01:09:56,897 --> 01:10:00,100
l'm looking forward to working with you.
See you tomorrow.

763
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:02,604
What's going on?

764
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:16,752
And Wills and Chico in 510.

765
01:10:17,086 --> 01:10:19,293
King and Eagle in 407.

766
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:22,833
What the hell do you think you're doing?

767
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:25,881
l hate your fucking guts
as much as you hate mine...

768
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,379
but why haven't your men responded
to our order?

769
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,179
-What order?
-Don't give me that, you asshole!

770
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,843
Four men, all-day stakeout, remember?

771
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,511
What stakeout?

772
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:39,107
Why, you son of a bitch,
l got a sitting target with no protection...

773
01:10:39,195 --> 01:10:41,188
all because you got this hard-on for me.

774
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,065
l don't Know what you're talking about.
l never got an order for four men.

775
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,440
l short faxed this morning.

776
01:10:46,536 --> 01:10:48,825
-Who sent it?
-Blakely sent it.

777
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:51,791
Let's call Blakely
and see what he has to say.

778
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:53,667
Good idea, do it.

779
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:57,087
He's a reasonable man. He'd wanna hear
how you screwed up so bad.

780
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,461
Give me four men.

781
01:11:04,557 --> 01:11:08,223
Spencer, Marra, Furillo, and Snowden.

782
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:12,775
Don't worry, l'll Keep a lid on it.

783
01:11:31,004 --> 01:11:32,831
All right, here's what we got.

784
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,007
So far, he's struck early evening,
around 6:00 or 7:00.

785
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:38,133
But just in case, Keep on your toes.

786
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:41,050
Spence, let me show you around
for a minute.

787
01:11:45,687 --> 01:11:49,187
-Are these bozos any good?
-Yeah, Snowden used to be with SWAT.

788
01:11:49,733 --> 01:11:53,103
-Good.
-The other two, they're sort of new.

789
01:11:54,113 --> 01:11:58,325
Terrific. You let me take Snowden and
one more. You take the other one outside.

790
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:01,863
Hey, guys. He's very resourceful.

791
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:04,707
So don't go looking for him
Knocking on the front door.

792
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:06,536
Furillo, come with me.

793
01:12:10,882 --> 01:12:12,377
My aching balls.

794
01:12:15,971 --> 01:12:18,463
For a sitting duck,
you're a pretty cool customer.

795
01:12:18,558 --> 01:12:21,227
l Know a lot of guys
who'd be shaking in the closet.

796
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:26,475
Before we go into practice,
we always undergo analysis ourselves.

797
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:30,611
Keeps us on balance, in touch with reality.

798
01:12:31,406 --> 01:12:34,775
-Sort of practice what you preach?
-Yes.

799
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:42,160
What the hell is with that?

800
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:47,416
Psychiatry, Sam, isn't always preaching.

801
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:50,460
Sometimes it's persuasion.

802
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,559
Detective Dietz, please.

803
01:12:58,436 --> 01:12:59,931
This is Officer Terrell.

804
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:02,809
l'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Can l take a message?

805
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,892
41 29. OKay.

806
01:13:06,946 --> 01:13:08,191
Wicker, where's Dietz?

807
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:10,950
l don't Know.
He split and said he'd be back tomorrow.

808
01:13:11,785 --> 01:13:13,659
So Carmen, over at the news...

809
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:16,113
she printed it just like l told her.

810
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,665
You made it up?

811
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:19,532
Every word.

812
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,169
All by yourself?

813
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,371
No, Dr. ParK helped me with the big words.

814
01:13:25,175 --> 01:13:27,168
Jesus, how did you ever get it approved?

815
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,426
l haven't actually done that yet.

816
01:13:31,098 --> 01:13:32,261
What?

817
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:35,050
You should have seen the trip
l laid on Cardoza.

818
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,933
Shit, Dietz.
You'll get your ass in a sling over this.

819
01:13:39,817 --> 01:13:42,984
Spence, l'd settle for that on this one.

820
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:51,031
You get down there and look at the fax log,
and then look at the dupe sheets...

821
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:53,957
and if you don't find it there,
get Blakely on the phone.

822
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:55,535
We'll raise some hell.

823
01:14:05,638 --> 01:14:07,547
-Got it.
-Great.

824
01:14:07,932 --> 01:14:10,886
This is Terrell again. ls Dietz back yet?

825
01:14:11,185 --> 01:14:14,353
Sorry, Terrell,
nobody seems to Know where he is. Bye.

826
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:26,951
Stay on your toes, guys.

827
01:14:31,876 --> 01:14:33,869
Goddamn lying little prick.

828
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:36,535
Yeah, this is Lt. Cardoza for Capt. Blakely.

829
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:41,043
He did what?

830
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:43,553
That son of a bitch!

831
01:14:43,889 --> 01:14:46,891
You're goddamn right, l'm gonna pull him.
Where is he?

832
01:14:47,435 --> 01:14:48,929
Francine, get in here!

833
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:11,618
Dr. ParK.

834
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:13,626
Hello?

835
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:36,944
Dr. ParK.

836
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,441
Dietz, is that you?
What the hell are you doing?

837
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:41,491
WorKing.

838
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,286
You're about to experience crucifixion.

839
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:48,373
Blakely wants you to send those men back,
and he wants you in right now.

840
01:15:48,463 --> 01:15:51,998
l can't do that, because l'm not here,
and you didn't talk to me.

841
01:15:52,092 --> 01:15:53,123
Oh, man.

842
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,416
Francine, please.

843
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:56,712
l think l can get the guy that nailed Malloy.

844
01:15:56,805 --> 01:15:58,798
But l need your help. Don't tell Blakely.

845
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,392
l can't help you, Dietz.

846
01:16:01,477 --> 01:16:04,229
Because you're not there,
and l haven't talked to you.

847
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,643
Good luck.

848
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:08,849
Attagirl.

849
01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:22,497
We got a guy on the corner
with a blue jacket.

850
01:16:23,502 --> 01:16:25,163
He's moving east.

851
01:16:27,173 --> 01:16:30,590
Looks to me
like a high-ranking government official.

852
01:16:31,178 --> 01:16:33,634
He's probably waiting
for a homosexual rendezvous.

853
01:16:42,858 --> 01:16:44,400
Now he stops.

854
01:16:48,656 --> 01:16:49,901
Nice try.

855
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:54,201
He's talking to himself.

856
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:02,042
No, the boyfriend's not there.
He's walking the other way.

857
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:09,007
We've got a lady with a baby carriage.

858
01:17:09,888 --> 01:17:11,087
They're on the north side.

859
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:13,798
Might be concealing a small nuclear device.

860
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:20,809
And the baby carriage goes away.

861
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,015
Dr. ParK.

862
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,818
Dietz, it's me, Terrell.

863
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:03,190
-Who?
-Officer ''Kiss my ass'' Terrell.

864
01:18:03,282 --> 01:18:04,314
Yeah.

865
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:06,982
Jesus, l've been trying
to get a hold of you all day.

866
01:18:07,078 --> 01:18:09,996
You remember the first victim
that got Killed? Todd Arthur?

867
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:14,329
The night that he got killed, he came
to the station to the report a death threat.

868
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:18,121
lt was a message on his answering machine.
And you'll never believe this.

869
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:22,048
Listen, he even brought in the tape,
and we got it.

870
01:18:22,262 --> 01:18:24,884
-So what does it say?
-lt's not what he says.

871
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:26,926
lt's how he says it.

872
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:30,017
Hold on. Wait a second.

873
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,433
l called to see if you were home.

874
01:18:34,693 --> 01:18:36,935
l have to kill you tonight.

875
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:39,990
Terrell, play it again.

876
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:43,945
l called to see if you were home.

877
01:18:44,496 --> 01:18:46,868
l have to kill you tonight.

878
01:18:50,711 --> 01:18:51,992
lt's him.

879
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:58,635
Spence, l think l Know where he is.
You stay here, in case l missed anything.

880
01:19:06,813 --> 01:19:08,806
He's on the second floor, and he's armed.

881
01:19:08,899 --> 01:19:10,358
He's already Killed one cop.

882
01:19:10,442 --> 01:19:15,151
Tell me if you got a better way. l say
l'll take the front stairs, you take the back...

883
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,861
we meet on the second floor,
l'll get out the bait.

884
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:19,487
Sounds all right to me, l guess.

885
01:19:19,577 --> 01:19:22,329
What do you mean, you guess?
You were on the SWAT team.

886
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:25,166
That's Snowden, not me.
l've never been on a SWAT team.

887
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,282
Shit.

888
01:19:27,253 --> 01:19:28,996
Maybe we should call for backup?

889
01:19:29,338 --> 01:19:31,248
Unfortunately, l can't do that.

890
01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:36,709
Hello, how are you?

891
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:39,303
Just taking a walk in the park here.
No problem.

892
01:19:39,392 --> 01:19:40,767
How are you, dear?

893
01:19:57,537 --> 01:19:59,364
Yo, brothers, what's up?

894
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:17,009
Shit, check it out.

895
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,610
Sam, come here. Take a look at this.

896
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,322
Call it in.

897
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,882
Look at this, there's a page missing.

898
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,921
-What letter?
-D-l-E--

899
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:54,726
Call my house. That's 555-9950.

900
01:20:56,062 --> 01:20:59,229
Tell them to get out of there right now,
and you call for backup.

901
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,025
Hello?

902
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,205
Hello, Mrs. Dietz?

903
01:21:36,107 --> 01:21:40,735
Yes, operator, this is a police emergency.
l need an intercept on 555-9950.

904
01:21:52,418 --> 01:21:54,161
-How was your day?
-Pretty good.

905
01:21:54,253 --> 01:21:55,416
-Was it good?
-Yes.

906
01:21:55,504 --> 01:21:57,414
-Do you have a lot of homework?
-No.

907
01:21:57,507 --> 01:21:58,966
-You sure?
-Yes.

908
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:03,131
Good. 'Cause you're gonna do it right away,
or you don't watch any TV tonight.

909
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:07,623
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

910
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,333
Yeah.

911
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:18,507
Please, don't hurt my son.

912
01:23:32,656 --> 01:23:34,032
What do you want?

913
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,578
l want you to sit.

914
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,994
Come on.

915
01:23:44,879 --> 01:23:46,254
Excuse me.

916
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:49,966
My name is Carol.

917
01:23:51,136 --> 01:23:52,464
And you're?

918
01:23:52,846 --> 01:23:54,305
Waiting for you.

919
01:23:58,686 --> 01:24:00,560
May l sit in this chair?

920
01:24:01,523 --> 01:24:02,602
Yes.

921
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:17,831
Do you have a name?

922
01:24:21,086 --> 01:24:22,878
You can call me Buck.

923
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:24,417
Young Buck.

924
01:24:27,552 --> 01:24:29,177
That's a nice name.

925
01:24:34,226 --> 01:24:37,477
ls there anything that l can do?

926
01:24:41,526 --> 01:24:44,444
-Where are you going?
-l just want some juice.

927
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,773
l'll get you some juice, sweetheart.

928
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,238
No.

929
01:24:51,204 --> 01:24:52,449
You sit.

930
01:24:54,082 --> 01:24:56,918
-l'm sitting.
-That's nice.

931
01:24:57,836 --> 01:25:00,292
Let's go get you some of that juice.

932
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,812
lt's a 9-millimeter semi-automatic.

933
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,027
You can do just about anything
with this gun.

934
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:30,410
See, the safety is on right now.

935
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,164
-So if you pull the trigger--
-Corey.

936

939
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,423
Do you have enough juice?

940
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,921
Yeah.

941
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,382

You can't.

947
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:10,251
Safety off.

948
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,706
You don't want to hurt us.

949
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,795
Buck, it's not funny anymore.

950
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:21,133
Do you?

951
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:24,221
No.

952
01:26:31,276 --> 01:26:33,233
No, don't hurt yourself.

953
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:35,565
-Or this one?
-No.

954
01:26:35,656 --> 01:26:37,364
Arthur!

955
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,448
Corey! Come to me!

956
01:26:46,543 --> 01:26:47,623
Dad!

959
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:59,625
-Do l have to go to school tomorrow?
-No.

960
01:28:01,003 --> 01:28:02,996
What do they do with dead bodies?

961
01:28:03,089 --> 01:28:04,963
God takes care of them.

962
01:28:12,432 --> 01:28:13,678
You okay?

963
01:28:20,316 --> 01:28:22,890
You Know, it was your idea to move to LA.

964
01:28:23,236 --> 01:28:25,443
You wanna give New York another try?

965
01:28:27,742 --> 01:28:29,284
No, too much crime.

966
01:28:41,173 --> 01:28:43,166
Jim, take a look at this.

967
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:47,127
You believe this Kid did all those Killings?
Did you see the closet?

968
01:28:47,431 --> 01:28:49,886
Did you see how much firepower
he had in there?

969
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:52,301
He had enough firepower
to start World War lll.

970
01:28:53,271 --> 01:28:55,809
The sickest thing is, his father was a cop.
