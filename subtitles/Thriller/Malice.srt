2
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,278
Little Ricky, where are you baby?
Come on honey... it's dinner time.

3
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:39,664
It's your favourite flavour - Liver.
Where are you?

4
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:46,292
There you are. Hey. . what're you doing under there?

5
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:52,060
What you doing under there?
What's the matter?

6
00:03:54,731 --> 00:04:00,021
Oh. . Ricky baby, what's the matter sweetheart?

7
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,471
We're ready for you doctor.

8
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,141
How is she?
- Still in the O. T. I haven't heard anything yet.

9
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:39,232
When did this happen?
- He was waiting for her at her place when she got home from class.

10
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,825
Forensics say it was the same man
who raped Cara Latham.

11
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,487
Did you really need a forensics expert to tell you that?

12
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:50,579
Andy.
Dana, when was the last time I asked your department to
beef up the security and cameras, right?

13
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,959
I mean not the first four times. It's the last time.

14
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:58,315
Don't get pissy with me professor.
I don't have the manpower to break up a fraternity party.

15
00:04:58,628 --> 00:04:59,932
Suction
- Suction.

16
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:00,974
What's that pressure?

17
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,998
Less than 70. Sixty-nine.
She's sliding down pretty fast.

18
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,336
We're gonna lose her doctor.
- I would not bet my ranch on that.

19
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,630
David, drop 0. 2 ccs of epinephrine.

20
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:11,559
Tanya, give me the stitch please.
- 3,0 silk.

21
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,865
We've gone at 63. Epinephrine doctor?
- No, Not yet.

22
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,452
60.

23
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:26,168
Still think it's a phenobarbital reaction?

24
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,086
Epinephrine.

25
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:35,096
And. .
- At ease up on retraction pressure.

26
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,885
65 & going up.
- No doubt about that.

27
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,020
68.
- I don't believe that.

28
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:44,108
72.
- How about your scissors?

29
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,986
Metzenbaum.
- Beautiful.

30
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,483
80.
- She's out of the woods.

31
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,412
Great to practice medicine.
Irrigation please.

32
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:58,531
Dr. Robertson, would you please close the wound for me?
Nice going, people.

33
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,832
By the way, everybody:

34
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,296
it's great to be in Saint Agnes.

35
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,394
That was good work.

36
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,013
Dr. Robertson...
May I call you Matthew?
- Of course.

37
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,601
Matthew... .

38
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,483
I'm the new guy around here and I want to make friends, so... .

39
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,529
I'll say this to you and we'll start fresh.

40
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:35,532
If you don't like my jokes, don't laugh.

41
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:40,708
If you have a medical opinion, then please
speak up and speak up loud.

42
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:45,678
But if you ever again tell me or my surgical
staff that we're going to lose a patient,

43
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:50,264
... I'm going to take out your lungs
with a fuckin' ice cream scoop.

44
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:53,519
Do you understand me?

45
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,313
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

46
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,033
Don't be ridiculous.
Everybody likes me.

47
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,229
Dr. Hill!
- Ya.

48
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,748
I'm Andy Safian.
I'm Associate Dean at the college & I wondered. .

49
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:19,136
if you could tell me anything about Bridget Kelly's condition.

50
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:24,385
Well, she has a badly bruised liver but I
think she's gonna be just fine.

51
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,853
Great. Thanks to you.

52
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:31,983
Well, come to the midnight show, I love
to take the next of kin.

53
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,053
It's Jed Hill, right?

54
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,494
"Galloping" Jed Hill?

55
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,435
Excuse me.

56
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,665
We were at the high school together.

57
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:48,975
You're kidding me.
You went to Van Buren?

58
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.
- Wow!

59
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:55,227
How long you've been in Westerly?
- Well, I've been here about nine hours now. Van Buren, huh?

60
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:59,771
Yeah, well, we weren't in the same... we didn't travel
in the same circles but...

61
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,232
Did I give you a hard time?
- No, you didn't know who the hell I was. So. .

62
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,123
Dr. Hill...

63
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:09,780
Hi Tanya!

64
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:14,906
I just wanted to say congratulations.
We're all very happy that you're here.

65
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:18,368
Well, thank you. It's. .
it's nice to be here.

66
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,878
Looks like you're again the popular man.

67
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:31,722
I hope to see you around.
- Yeah, me too.

68
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:39,769
Oh, that's wonderful, Michelle.

69
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:45,198
Hey, why don't we try painting on a paper
& not on your arm?

70
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,901
I am a monster.
- Teacher, teacher...

71
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,994
Hey, don't you ever play with plastic bags or

72
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:56,704
I'll tie you up and I'll feed you to little cape
monster, you got it?

73
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:09,595
I heard what happened.
- Can you come on lunch now?

74
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,432
in a minute.

75
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,317
Yeah, the guy got in when she was
at her class.

76
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,262
She's gonna be alright.
- Looks like it...

77
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,246
turns out that the hospital has a new surgeon,
this whizkid from Mass General did a great job.

78
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:34,165
So I went back to introduce myself, to thank him
& are you ready for this?

79
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,256
We were at the High School together.
- Oh, no kidding.

80
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:43,594
Speak of the Devil...
- And the Devil appears.

81
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,725
I was just recounting all your experts' here.

82
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,398
This is my wife, Tracy.
Tracy, this is Dr. Jed Hill.

83
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,563
A school friend of Andy.

84
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:56,819
This is Dr. Sullivan, Alan and Tracy Safian.
- Andy.

85
00:09:56,993 --> 00:10:00,032
Andy works at the college.
- He's Associate Dean, Mr. Hill.

86
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:03,374
Fantastic.
- I don't leap tall buildings in a single bound.

87
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:06,213
But we are very proud of him.
- That's well. You should be.

88
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:10,794
Listen, we're having a small reception to welcome Jed
to Saint Agnes. Why don't you come along?

89
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:14,505
Oh, we'll have to go. We have a lunch appointment.
- Oh, maybe some other time.

90
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,720
Definitely.

91
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:20,142
Nice meeting you, Tracy.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

92
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:28,279
Well, we got the estimate from the plumber this morning.
- And?

93
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,511
Are you ready for this?
- How much?

94
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:38,657
It's... 13,000 and change.
- How much change?

95
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:43,249
It's 14,000.
- Alright, forget it. I'm gonna do the work myself.

96
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:45,214
I got a better idea.
- No.

97
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,506
Well, just for a little while. It pays and goes,
we rent it to some visiting lecturer.

98
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,464
I don't want to rent out the third floor.
I don't want a stranger in our house.

99
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,052
Alright, suit yourself.

100
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:58,895
Would've been nice living in
a home with running water but...

101
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,942
I'm a simple girl.

102
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,609
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up after work.
- No, it's okay.

103
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:09,952
Forget it. I'm gonna pick you up.
There's a maniac who's in this town.

104
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:14,202
Helen can give me a ride.
- She can? Are you sure?

105
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,758
Make sure she waits until you're inside the house.

106
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:24,427
I'll have her provide air coverage if you want.

107
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,976
It's funny. I married a funny woman.

108
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,496
See ya.
- Nice.

109
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:23,699
You know in street clothes,
Helen looks positively masculine.
- What?

110
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:28,504
Helen. You said you were getting a
ride home from Helen.

111
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:32,803
Were you spying on me?
- No, no. Looking out my window.

112
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,213
Then you were looking at Dennis Riley, my mother's
lawyer. He had papers for me to sign.

113
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:40,803
What kind of papers?

114
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,081
Something about my mother's estate.
What is this?

115
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,397
Your mother's estate?
- Yes.

116
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,521
You told me she barely got by in
her social welfare check .

117
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:52,482
And now she's Lady Astor?
- Come on, Andy.

118
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:56,169
There was a small account for the
cemetery arrangements.

119
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,410
The money lacks about which Dennis
wanted to talk to me about.

120
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,224
And now what is it you want to
talk to me about?

121
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,238
Sorry.

122
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,556
Hey listen, would you think any less of
me if I use a fork?

123
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,223
I've been losing my strength here.
- I can't let that happen.

124
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,390
Lie back. Give it to me.

125
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:24,442
Lie back. That's right.
All the way back.

126
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:28,066
Technique, huh?
- The expert.

127
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:32,954
It's all in my hands, see?
Open. Open up.

128
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:37,040
Good boy.
Delicious, huh?

129
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:47,173
Delicious. More...

130
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,305
Look, I think your strength
is returning.

131
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,390
It's a miracle.

132
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:18,923
Andy.

133
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,840
What is it?
- He's there again.

134
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,895
So?
- He's looking at us.

135
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:35,947
Sounds like he's playing one of those electric keyboards.
- Jesus, it gives me the creeps.

136
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:40,281
Be nice.
His mother works as a night nurse.

137
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,077
Probably he is lonely.

138
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:54,795
We gotta get some curtains up here.
It's a priority.

139
00:14:56,807 --> 00:15:02,230
Curtains are now the priority.
- Not until we decide what to paint.

140
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:09,194
There is no point in painting if we
are going to break the house for the plumbing.

141
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:13,411
So we are back to where we started.

142
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:44,752
Oh Jeez!... .

143
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,568
Front door was wide open.
- Oh...

144
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,280
You scared the hell out of me.

145
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,948
I should have knocked but...
- Oh, no, no.

146
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:59,706
Yeah... I have been working with a liquid paint remover.
Sometimes I get a headache from these odors.

147
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:02,455
Oh, you should be taking a B Complex.
- Say again?

148
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:06,420
Well, a loading dose of a B-12
would help to enhance the cerebral cap... .

149
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,471
Never mind.
- No, no. why did you stop? That sounded great.

150
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:15,059
Well, no it just occurred to me that I was suggesting you take a jar
of vitamins, you'd be smart not to leave the door open.

151
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:18,153
Look at that. I saved myself $ 5. 95.

152
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:24,242
I was in the neighbourhood looking at some houses
and I thought I would take you and your wife out
for the lunch as promised.

153
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,037
Well, Tracy is out to her class but I can get
cleaned up and we could go out ourselves.

154
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,044
Sounds good.
- Alright. Okay, I'll be right back.

155
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:45,516
So this is a real Victorian house, huh?
- Yeah, buried under a hundred years of paint.

156
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:50,100
It was part of the underground rails
during the civil war.

157
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:53,585
Lack of comfort makes up for the history.

158
00:16:54,835 --> 00:17:00,027
You know anything about architecture??
- Architecture... oh architecture is my life.

159
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:02,031
If I hadn't been a doctor, I'd have been...

160
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,750
... It'd have been a building.
Is this a Degas?

161
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,503
Ya. I think it's original.
Tracy's father gave it to her.

162
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,679
She's been having these abdominal pains.

163
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,146
How often?
- Maybe once a week or all week days.

164
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:27,519
How long do they last?
- Half a minute, sometimes even longer.

165
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:33,235
Is she seeing someone?
- Yeah, a doctor in Boston named Lillianfield.

166
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:38,486
David Lillianfield. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him. Lillianfield is a good man.

167
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:44,172
The thing is, we really wanna have kids.
Tracy is nuts about it.

168
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,673
So am I.
- I'll tell you what.

169
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,349
Give it another couple of weeks and if there
is no change, have a come by and see me.

170
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,488
Alright.

171
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,210
Hey Stanley...

172
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,638
Hey Doc, it hurts when I do this.

173
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:03,150
Then don't do that. And get some
new jokes, Stanley.

174
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:10,028
So I told him 'why don't you come by and
look at ours and maybe we'd work out. '

175
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,161
You did what?

176
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:16,666
You're the one who wanted to rent it out.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

177
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:22,211
Do I look thrilled?
- You're not thrilled. I can see that now but. .

178
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:25,672
this is better than a visiting lecturer.
Jed is a friend.

179
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:29,264
He's not a friend. He didn't even
remember your name, Alan.

180
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,935
I mean, common the guy had just been
through twelve hours of surgery.

181
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:37,152
What is it Andy? You want to relive the Highschool,
be friends with the quarterback this time?

182
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,029
No, he was the running back.
And stop talking to me like I'm eleven.

183
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:45,950
What's your problem with this guy?
I mean he's smart, he's funny... .

184
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:49,906
... and he's a brilliant doctor.
- I know. I know he's brilliant Andy...

185
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,516
I can tell by the way the nurses seem to fall on
their knees when he walks down the hallway.

186
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:57,167
I mean, this guy doesn't have friends,
he has subjects.

187
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:58,835
Well... .

188
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,505
It's not too late, we
can call it off.

189
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:07,301
No, no. I'm leaving it up to you.

190
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,818
If you want to live with that, it's your decision.
- You're gonna get to like him. You really will.

191
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,000
And you know what else?

192
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:18,755
We could even ask him to recommend
another doctor for you.

193
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,236
Hello, what?

194
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:26,293
If for no other reason, then it's nonsense to drive two hours
to see Lillianfield in Boston when we could just easily...

195
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:31,421
Andy, please tell me you didn't say anything to Jed.
Please tell me you didn't share my problems with him.

196
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,837
It came up.

197
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:36,693
It came up.

198
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:43,188
I apologise.
- Alright.

199
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,243
I will go along with this
for a few months...

200
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,591
Only because I want the sofa...

201
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:49,937
... combining with the stairs.

202
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,901
Oh my God, is he moving in tonight?

203
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,914
You're assuming it's Jed?
- Oh, I'm quite certain it's Jed. Open the door.

204
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:05,546
It could be anyone.
- The angels could dance on pins, but they do not. It's Jed.

205
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:11,300
What makes you so sure?
- You want to bet me?

206
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:13,506
No.

207
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,719
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

208
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:19,503
Hello.

209
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,891
Dr. Hill. Please come in.

210
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,782
Andy just got through telling me,
we're gonna be roommates.

211
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:31,487
Well, that's why I stopped by.
I just wanted to make sure that it was really okay.

212
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,511
Don't be silly. I'm looking forward to it.
- She is. She is really looking forward to it.

213
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,076
Excellent.

214
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,013
The mid-term was at 8:30. I set my alarm for 7
& it didn't go off.

215
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:58,734
I mean if Professor Schmidt wants to give
me an incomplete, then I really don't care.

216
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:03,400
I can't control everything in this world.
My alarm didn't go off.

217
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,485
That's good.
That's very good, Paula.

218
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:11,456
That's so much better than locking your copy of
Beowulf in your friend's car.

219
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,159
Thank You.

220
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:15,401
Yeah.

221
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,668
Detective Harris wishes to see you.
- Really.

222
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,884
I'm amazed she could find the building.

223
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:24,425
We'll have to continue this next week if you don't mind.
- Fine.

224
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:32,393
Hang on, Paula. Hi Dana, go on in.
It will be just a second.

225
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:36,312
Mrs. Worthington, I want you to note all test and
exam times for Ms. Paula Bell.

226
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:40,326
She's to receive wake up calls from this office.
- Wake up calls?

227
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:45,991
She can't be expected to control the world, Mrs. Worthington.
Her alarm didn't go off.

228
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,326
I'll see you next week, Paula.

229
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,676
Sorry.
- Jesus!

230
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,886
She able to give any kind of description?

231
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:01,011
All she remembers is her cat crouching
under a chair...

232
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:04,803
... and an arm grabbing her from behind.

233
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:07,271
Is there any chance she'll remember more?

234
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:08,642
I don't think so.

235
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:09,945
So...

236
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:14,108
What do we do now?
- We?

237
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:17,785
'We' don't do anything Andy.
Only one of us is a police detective.

238
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:20,446
Maybe not even that many.

239
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:23,962
Oh... college wit.
Let me search my mind for a clever answer.

240
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,668
How about 'bite me'?

241
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,634
Touché.

242
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:31,474
We have ordered more ''Security Precautions'' pamphlets.

243
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,881
More pamphlets?
- That's right.

244
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:37,807
Do you know what I see when I come
to work every morning?

245
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:45,399
I see fathers loading trunks, suitcases, plants
and daughters in their station wagons.

246
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,233
Presumably to drive them off to school so that
they don't pose quite as high a death threat.

247
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,163
See, I don't think I'm being unreasonable
when I ask...

248
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,551
... what you and your crack-team of professionals are doing

249
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,596
other than distributing literature to repress this situation.

250
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,298
I need a list of anyone who had access to
the students' schedules.

251
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:06,668
Both victims were inside the class
when our guy got in.

252
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:10,384
So you have narrowed it down to a couple
of thousand people.

253
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:14,097
A list, Andy.
I need it, now.

254
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:17,273
Dana...

255
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,914
What do you think he does with the hair?
- The hair?

256
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:24,944
Yeah, he gets off all the hair.
What do you think he does with it?

257
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,954
Perhaps makes pillows. Who knows?

258
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:36,245
Billy, I want you in bed by 10,
you hear me?

259
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:37,827
You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry about that.

260
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:39,990
What the hell are you doing here?

261
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,039
Are you alright?
- No, I'm not alright.

262
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:48,090
Anybody home?

263
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:53,678
Up here, honey.

264
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:15,241
This is ridiculous.
- Go to sleep.

265
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:18,501
Who the hell can sleep
with them doing that all night?

266
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:20,663
It's been like three hours.

267
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,608
I'll ask him to turn it down.

268
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:29,469
No, I don't want to make a big thing about it.
- No, if you can't fall asleep...

269
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:38,725
You think maybe he heard us?
- I hope so.

270
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:42,906
Where're you going?
- To the bathroom.

271
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:54,918
I know why guys like you become doctors.

272
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,081
It's not what you yhink.

273
00:25:57,257 --> 00:26:02,216
I think it's to make a lot of money
& see a lot of naked women.

274
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:03,513
Oh. . well. .

275
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:06,057
Then it is what you think.

276
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:15,478
Hey, ease yourself.
I'm not done with you yet.

277
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:18,858
I am immune to alcohol.
- Yeah?

278
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:21,441
We'll see about that.

279
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:31,276
Tracy.

280
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,224
You alright?

281
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,438
Ya, I'll be right there.

282
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,238
You worried me for a second.
- No, I'm fine.

283
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:14,469
Come on, let's go to bed.

284
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,841
hey, how you there, old man?

285
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,133
Six miles a day keeps the doctor away.

286
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,174
Want some coffee?
- No, never touch in the morning.

287
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,924
You okay, Tracy?
- I'm fine.

288
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:58,181
Well, I'll grab quick shower, fly over to the
hospital. I'll catch you guys later.

289
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:21,047
Are you sure she didn't call to
cancel her appointment?

290
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,803
Yes, I'm sure that I called her
yesterday to remind her.

291
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:27,893
Did you try calling her again?
- Nobody's there, professor.

292
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:31,265
I keep getting her answering machine.
- She's there.

293
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,564
She's not answering it.

294
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:57,716
Paula?

295
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,264
I'm gonna need a statement.

296
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,269
Andy...

297
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:03,644
You wanna hear about the first time I
ever saw a corpse?

298
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:05,731
No.

299
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:09,590
It was my first year of medical
school, ghost anatomy.

300
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:13,629
The instructor begin cutting the corpse's head.

301
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,003
People were running out of the room.
Some fainted there.

302
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:20,180
I tell you, it really didn't bother me over that much though.

303
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,387
It's a great story Jed.

304
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,140
Of course, I'm not looking forward to
the same thing but... .

305
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:32,900
Hey, You'll get over it.

306
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,130
Hey Stanley, who the hell is that in the backfield?
Livelle or something. He's off the bench .

307
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:50,841
What happened to Krakowski?
- Funked the piss test.

308
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,756
That upsets me.

309
00:31:55,851 --> 00:32:00,264
Guy can't stay off of cocaine even for one
million dollars.

310
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,143
Man, I'll give my right arm for
one million dollars.

311
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:07,439
We cannot afford plumbing for Christ's sake.

312
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,371
Would you really?
- What?

313
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:14,996
give your right arm for one million dollars?

314
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:20,034
You mean like, literally?
- Yeah.

315
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:26,044
Well, not even an arm.
Let's just say a finger.

316
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:35,096
One finger, for one milion dollars?
Oh god, this is a strange conversation.

317
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,307
What we're talking about is a surgical procedure just...

318
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:41,900
... to the joint.
Would you do it?

319
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:45,765
No.

320
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:48,717
Really?

321
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,273
Would you?

322
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,633
No.

323
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:07,217
I should be getting back
Jed let me... .

324
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:13,390
Hey, stay for one more drink with me.
- Tracy's gonna be home.

325
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:15,258
I'll see you.
- Yeah.

326
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:24,749
Stanley.

327
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:30,370
Would you please bring those two girls
a round of whatever it is they're drinking?

328
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:33,666
Bourbon.
- Bourbon it is.

329
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,020
Got a minute?
- Sure.

330
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,192
This... is the living room here.
Take a seat.

331
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:01,830
I just need you to clear up a few things for me.
- Like what?

332
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:08,377
Paula Bell came to see you 3 times, is that right?
- That's right.

333
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:13,127
It would have been four times only... .
- What is this?

334
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:18,846
Last night we matched the soil sample taken from
Paula Bell's carpet to a sample taken from your yard.

335
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,938
I went inside, I told you that.

336
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:25,975
We also matched it to a sample
taken from Bridget Kelly's room.

337
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:28,783
Bridget came by here to pick up a
letter of recommendation.

338
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,284
Am I a suspect, Dana?

339
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,202
Am I a fucking suspect?

340
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:37,072
All three victims had been in to see you
before they were attacked.

341
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,539
I found Paula, for Christ's sake.

342
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,960
What was it that made you go to her house?
- She missed her appointment.

343
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:47,139
So you went to her house?
- Yes, because she was a screw-up & I've a responsibility.

344
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,047
What's your blood type, Andy?
- O+ve.

345
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:53,974
See, as luck would have it, you have the same
blood type as the perpetrator.

346
00:34:54,688 --> 00:35:00,691
Dana, this is crazy. In my entire life
I've never harmed anyone.

347
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,810
I believe you.
I don't think you're the guy.

348
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:05,972
Thank you.

349
00:35:09,538 --> 00:35:15,326
I need you to do something for me. It's procedural,
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask you to do it.

350
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:15,821
Do what?

351
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:21,256
I need a sperm sample to test
against the one taken from the victims.

352
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:24,761
I don't believe this.
- It's a simple thing Andy. Maybe in an hour

353
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:28,135
... you'll be eliminated as a suspect.

354
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,731
What if I refuse?

355
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:33,858
Give the way to my handcuffs.

356
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,724
Damn.
- No, no. It's much better.

357
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,601
No, it's not.
- No, it is.

358
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:48,161
At least you did not hit the
innocent bystanders  again.

359
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,334
Beautiful.

360
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:00,922
Andy.

361
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:04,520
Andy.

362
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:03,173
911 Emergency.

363
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:09,596
I'll show you the rotating muscle
if you don't mind, it's right in here okay...

364
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,760
... if it tears, you cannot comb hair, let
alone throw the ball.

365
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:20,339
That thing's been beeping all night.
Are you a drug dealer?

366
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,062
Yeah, you can say that.

367
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,667
Stanley.

368
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:31,158
Somebody, talk to me.

369
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:33,167
We've got massive haemorrhaging.
It's probably an ovary.

370
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:34,835
We'll have some more numbers in a few minutes.

371
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,046
Blood type.
- AB negative. We need more.

372
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:43,091
Tanya, get a hold of the Mass General, Boston, and
Mercy Hartford. If they're low, we're gonna need donors.

373
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:55,601
I'm sorry we had to put you through this, Andy.
You can go home now.

374
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,091
Andy.

375
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:04,089
Mr. Safian...
- Yeah.

376
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:13,085
Your wife's name came up on a 911.
It's a medical emergency.

377
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:16,791
David, what's the blood pressure?
- 93 above 57.

378
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,511
Heart rate?
- 86.

379
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:20,423
Capacity?
- 27.

380
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,098
Jed, did you see this?

381
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,312
Four to five weeks would be my guess.

382
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:36,112
She is pregnant?
- Not for long.

383
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:40,031
Her foetus got aborted from the trauma
of the procedure.

384
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:51,753
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

385
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:56,858
Dr. Hill...

386
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:04,141
Alright, let's begin.

387
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,943
Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

388
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:22,617
Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

389
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:26,083
What happened to my wife?
- She's bleeding internally.

390
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:30,305
Dr. Hill will come and talk to you
soon as her condition is stabilized.

391
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:34,387
Is she conscious?
- I'm sorry Mr. Safian, that's all I know.

392
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:46,239
We're almost done. I just wanna have one last
look around. Check for rings and watches. Suction.

393
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:47,803
Suction.

394
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:58,337
Well, I think we've got it all.
It's amazing it didn't erupt so sooner.

395
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:02,821
Jed.

396
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:07,763
You got some pathology in the second ovary.

397
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:15,268
Let me have a look in here. Harrington.
- Harrington.

398
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:18,858
It was twisted when I unpacked it.

399
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,774
Think it's necrotic?

400
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:27,653
Alright I want to do a frozen section right away,
see if we still get a viable ovary here.

401
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:29,154
We can't.
- Why not?

402
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:32,074
The pathologist is not present.
- Then what do I do for frozen section?

403
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,525
We can call him in.
- How long would that take?

404
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:37,602
30-40 minutes.
Hell, then I'd get a microscope and do it myself.

405
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:41,512
It'll take at least a half an hour
for the processor to warm up.

406
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:43,806
What's the pressure?
- 78.

407
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:47,844
I don't have that kind of time.
- You got maybe fifteen minutes.

408
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:54,823
Alright. Irrigate and try to get the BP
back up. I'll be right back.

409
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:03,790
Come with me.
- What's going on?

410
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,012
I had to remove one of Tracy's ovaries.

411
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:22,426
It ruptured. A large cyst had developed in
that what was causing her pain.

412
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:25,724
I've to be direct with you
because we're little under the gun.

413
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,653
Is it under control?
- Not yet.

414
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,321
There is a problem with Tracy's second ovary.

415
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:36,741
We discovered it was torsed or twisted
around in its own blood supply.

416
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:39,537
If I remove it, I'm simply
removing a dead organ...

417
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:44,003
... and in all likely Tracy will lead a
normal healthy life.

418
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,166
But...

419
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:52,260
... she won't ever be able to have children.

420
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:57,773
If I close her up now, she could die of
toxic-shock in the middle of the night.

421
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:06,567
Do whatever you have to do.
- Tracy's gonna be fine.

422
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:07,499
Yeah.

423
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:11,239
But what?
- I'll tell you later.

424
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:13,655
No.
No, tell me now.

425
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:27,469
Tracy was pregnant.
Of four weeks.

426
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:32,886
Tracy is pregnant?
- No Andy. The foetus aborted .

427
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:36,897
She sustained a lot of trauma.
There was nothing that could be done.

428
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:40,647
I'm sorry about it.

429
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:09,855
Artery clamp.

430
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:14,403
Dr. Hill, I think this might be a mistake.
How do you know it's not still viable?

431
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:19,068
This is the wife of a friend.
I'll not take any chances. Scalpel.

432
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:22,909
You could be taking out a viable ovary.

433
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:29,708
It's necrotic. Scalpel.
- Without the histology, you can't be sure.

434
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:31,790
I'm sure.

435
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,801
Tanya, give me the scalpel.

436
00:44:19,685 --> 00:44:20,572
Jed.

437
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:30,530
What you got there, George?
- It's from pathology.

438
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:36,243
Are they Histology report?

439
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:40,125
We took out a healthy ovary.

440
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:43,750
Only the surface was necrotic.

441
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,755
Jed, take this.

442
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,180
Look at it.

443
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:53,736
Then burn it.

444
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:00,859
That's a nice gesture, George.
Really.

445
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,980
The technician owes me a favour.
Lab won't be a problem.

446
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,785
It'll be a problem for me.

447
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:10,409
This hospital took out a healthy ovary.

448
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:14,120
I took out the ovary.
No one else.

449
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:18,923
It was a judgement call and
I stand by it.

450
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,519
Are you gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

451
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:32,226
I didn't do anything wrong.

452
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:57,469
I figured you probably hadn't eaten anything in a while.
- We should talk later, okay?

453
00:45:58,932 --> 00:46:04,687
Well, Andy, I wanted to have a word with Tracy.
Maybe later, okay? Jed...

454
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:10,065
Hello, Mrs. Safian. You gave
us quite a scare.

455
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:12,148
Did I?

456
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:15,759
Tracy, I know you've been told
all about what's happened.

457
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:17,480
Yes.

458
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:22,207
I don't know if there's any point in telling
you how sorry I am.

459
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,211
I spoke with a lawyer this morning.

460
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:30,001
I want to make sure you don't
do this to someone else.

461
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:50,326
The legal statements will be in a week.

462
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:53,246
I think we can bring them down from
the 30 million in a settlement.

463
00:46:53,415 --> 00:46:58,409
Let's not dick each other around here.
30 million, 25 million, what difference does it make?

464
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:02,800
You know anything over 10 million dollars
& I can't get insurance in this or any other state.

465
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,828
I say we go to a jury.
- I cannot recommend that.

466
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:05,661
Why not?

467
00:47:06,012 --> 00:47:08,468
Let me tell you what a jury sees.

468
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:12,686
A jury sees a beautiful young woman
married to a mild-mannered teacher.

469
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:16,305
They buy an old house and dream of
filling it up with children.

470
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:21,611
Now that is a honey-sweet painting and you
have ripped it to shreds with your scalpel.

471
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:23,703
You're my lawyer.
Am I right here?

472
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:25,632
It's not my job to hold your hand, doctor.

473
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:29,283
It's not your job to be an asshole either counsellor
but that doesn't seem to be stopping here.

474
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,909
Maybe if we all calm down.

475
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:36,164
We could bring in a private investigator,
dig up something on her background.

476
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,757
Lester, she volunteered five days a week
in a children's ward.

477
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,464
And baked cookies for the staff.

478
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,965
Looks like you picked the
wrong patient to screw up on, doctor.

479
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:50,351
I didn't pick her, counsellor.
Physicians don't get to choose.

480
00:47:50,524 --> 00:47:53,893
I'll need an ''expert''.
Who do you want to call?

481
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:57,652
What do you mean?
- An expert. Someone to make a statement.

482
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:02,320
A statement saying what?
- A statement saying that you're as good as you think you are.

483
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:11,130
Call Dr. Marvin Kessler.
Harvard Medical School.

484
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:12,877
Is that it Miss?

485
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:14,337
Yes.

486
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:21,324
How will I get in touch with you?
- You won't.

487
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:24,392
I don't want you to.

488
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:29,612
Tracy, why won't you let me help you
get through this?

489
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:32,316
This isn't a phase, Andy.

490
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:37,654
I can't have children. Ever.

491
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,582
He thought you were going to die.

492
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,038
Right about now he's wishing I did.

493
00:48:44,142 --> 00:48:47,505
Tracy, I love you.

494
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:51,202
He took my insights out...

495
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:54,592
And you gave him permission.

496
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,058
Goodbye, Andy.

497
00:49:20,296 --> 00:49:24,295
Dr. Kessler, would you describe your history
& relationship to Dr. Hill?

498
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:28,135
Dr. Hill was a student of mine at medical school.

499
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:33,765
From graduation I asked him to serve his
residency under my direction at Mass General.

500
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:38,850
And when he finished the residency,
I asked him to join our surgical staff.

501
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:42,647
Dr. Kessler, how long you've been teaching at Harvard Medical school?
- 21 years.

502
00:49:42,824 --> 00:49:45,991
How long you've been chief of staff at Mass General?
- 14 years.

503
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:50,077
So you've been in a position to work with thousands of young doctors.
Am I correct?
-Yes.

504
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,756
I might add that the doctors are there a pleasure to teach
& work with are among the very best in the world.

505
00:49:55,923 --> 00:50:01,547
And how would Dr. Hill rank in this group that
are among the very best in the world?
- There is no one any better.

506
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:03,338
Thank You.

507
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:04,987
Mr. Riley.

508
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:10,438
Dr. Kessler, your faith in Dr. Hill's surgical talent is obvious.

509
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,565
And completely deserved.

510
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:16,435
Dr. Kessler, seven months ago the position of Chief
of Surgery became available on Mass General.

511
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,772
Did you had Jed Hill seek this position?
- Yes, he did.

512
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,079
Did you give the position to Jed?
- Excuse me, my client's name is Dr. Hill.

513
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:27,576
Forgive me, did you award the position to Dr. Hill? - No.
Why not?

514
00:50:27,752 --> 00:50:31,087
Well, he was certainly qualified...
- But you didn't give him the job.

515
00:50:31,256 --> 00:50:33,129
There were many other candidates.

516
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,587
Surgeons more qualified?
- This isn't the trial, Mr. Riley.

517
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:40,890
Dr. Kessler, during Dr. Hill's residency in Mass General
you wrote several co-orderly valuations.

518
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,844
The valuations to be read and
reviewed by hospital administrators...

519
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:47,395
... department heads.
- Yes.

520
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:54,900
I'm looking at one... right now dated
June 15th, 1982 & bearing your signature.

521
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,868
It's coming up.

522
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:06,829
I'd like to read fom page 3, paragraph 4...

523
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:10,007
While Jed Hill consistently remains the
most skilled and the brightest of our residents...

524
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:15,718
... we should not ignore what the authorities of this
college observed that he suffers from "God Complex".

525
00:51:15,892 --> 00:51:19,725
'God-Complex'. That's not a typo, was it?
It says 'God-Complex'.

526
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,769
That was read nearly a decade ago.
- What's a 'God-Complex'?

527
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:28,568
How did you get this information? This was priviledged...
- Dr. Kessler...

528
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,485
What's a 'God-Complex'?

529
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:35,537
It's a term that has no clinical meaning... at all.
Doctors throw it around...

530
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,284
Sir, with all due respect, but knock it off.

531
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:40,674
What did you mean in this evaluation when
you said Dr. Hill had a 'God-Complex'?

532
00:51:41,423 --> 00:51:47,794
The power to heal can be an enormous thing,
an enormous thing...

533
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:51,971
to save a life. To get blood flowing into cells
and vital organs.

534
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:58,397
If a person can do that... And if one can do it
as exceptionally as Dr. Hill...

535
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:03,990
... it's not uncommon for a person like that
to begin to believe that he can do anything.

536
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:08,371
The power to heal can be like a drug.

537
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:09,404
'Like a drug', you're saying?

538
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:13,941
Would it've been uncommon for a person with a
'God-complex' to reject the advice of others?

539
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:15,838
No.

540
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:18,320
Would it've been uncommon for such a person to... .

541
00:52:18,686 --> 00:52:22,493
proceed on a course that others might reject
if only out of a sense of a God like power?

542
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,717
Oh, now I think you're vastly overstating.

543
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:28,761
Is that why you didn't give Dr. Hill the job?
- There were a number of other factors.

544
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,774
Is that why you removed a healthy ovary
without any scientific diagnosis?

545
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:35,892
Don't you address my client, Mr. Riley.
- Do you have a 'God-complex'?

546
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,554
This is not acceptable.
- No, no. Let him address me.

547
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:42,737
Jed.
-No, No. It's about time I got to give some answers here.

548
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:45,866
Stop typing.
This is off the record.

549
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:54,290
The question is, do I have a 'God-complex'.
- Dr. Kessler says yes.

550
00:52:54,468 --> 00:53:01,966
which makes me wonder if this lawyer has any idea...

551
00:53:02,143 --> 00:53:05,098
... as to the kind of grades one has
to receive in college...

552
00:53:05,272 --> 00:53:08,522
... to be accepted at a top medical school.

553
00:53:08,692 --> 00:53:12,145
If you have the vaguest clue as to
how talented someone has to be...

554
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:16,368
... to lead a surgical team.

555
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:19,206
I have an M. D. from Harvard,

556
00:53:19,372 --> 00:53:24,118
I am board certified in cardio-thoracic medicine
and trauma surgery,

557
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:28,543
I have been awarded citations from seven
different medical boards in New England,

558
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:32,632
and I am never, ever sick at sea.

559
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,094
So I ask you:

560
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:39,560
when someone goes into that chapel and they
fall on their knees and they pray to God...

561
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:43,976
... that their wife doesn't miscarry or that their
daughter doesn't bleed to death...

562
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:49,656
... or that their mother doesn't suffer acute
neural trauma from post-operative shock,

563
00:53:49,824 --> 00:53:51,699
... who do you think they're praying to?

564
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:59,629
Now, go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis,
and you go to your church,

565
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:04,707
and, with any luck, you might win the annual raffle,
but if you're looking for God:

566
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:08,468
he was in operating room number two on November 17,

567
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,173
and he doesn't like to be second guessed.

568
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:17,814
You ask me if I have a 'God complex'.
Let me tell you something:

569
00:54:17,982 --> 00:54:20,059
I am God.

570
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,443
This sideshow is over.

571
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:36,335
You got a winner here, Lester.

572
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:40,124
Call my office, in the morning
and we'll work out a settlement.

573
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:43,468
It gets better.
- What do you mean?

574
00:54:43,638 --> 00:54:47,139
We talked to the bartender of a
place called Prince William Tavern.

575
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:52,351
Ask 'God' how many shots of bourbon he had before he cut me open.

576
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:02,197
The insurance company will be drafting
to my firm's account by sometime next week...

577
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:06,118
So if you sign right away, you should get
your money few days after that.

578
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,375
Listen there are some things we
should discuss now that can embroil a policy.

579
00:55:09,545 --> 00:55:13,461
Dennis, this isn't such a good time for me.
- We're talking about 20 million dollars.

580
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:16,636
Dennis, I think about what I want for breakfast,
I start crying.

581
00:55:16,804 --> 00:55:20,339
You could put the money in a coffee pot,
for all I care.

582
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:02,271
It's 8:30.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

583
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,652
You should go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

584
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:17,508
Mrs. Worthington.

585
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:20,481
Mrs. Worthington.

586
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,671
Mr. Leemus.

587
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:37,395
Mr. Leemus.

588
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:31,208
Christ!

589
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:34,611
You surprised me. Holy Shi...

590
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:39,202
I was working on the front.
I didn't know anybody else was here.

591
00:58:39,378 --> 00:58:43,329
I saw the lights...
- It's my mother's hair.

592
00:58:43,508 --> 00:58:47,258
She's not alive anymore.
That's her in the picture.

593
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:53,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get any of your things. I. .
- No, that's okay.

594
00:58:55,353 --> 00:58:59,732
I came down to get a light,
I didn't realize...

595
00:59:02,403 --> 00:59:06,069
You live down here?
- No, no. Just for a while.

596
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:09,825
My landlady asked me to leave.

597
00:59:09,995 --> 00:59:12,368
I won't stay here long.
No, I promise Mr. Safian.

598
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,458
No, you stay here as long as you want.

599
00:59:15,628 --> 00:59:18,033
I'll just take this and I'll go back up.

600
00:59:18,452 --> 00:59:21,997
Good night, Mr. Safian.
- Good night, Earl.

601
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:45,812
Don't worry, it doesn't look as
bad as the other guy.

602
01:00:45,984 --> 01:00:48,607
I could have killed him.

603
01:00:50,575 --> 01:00:55,237
Junior, have you met the professor?
A very tough guy.

604
01:00:55,412 --> 01:00:59,327
If you want something done, alright
goddamn it, you call a teacher.

605
01:01:00,586 --> 01:01:02,792
Let me buy you a drink.

606
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:17,476
You know, there is one thing I
realized during all this.

607
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:21,860
Jed had just come out of the OR to
talk to me. He was covered in blood and

608
01:01:22,029 --> 01:01:27,237
he was telling me what he was about to
do and then he needed my permission to do it.

609
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,657
And... there was a second, maybe a
second and a half... .

610
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:34,786
... between him telling me that Tracy
was pregnant and...

611
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:38,744
... then telling me that the foetus was
aborted during surgery.

612
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:45,088
That second,
that second and a half...

613
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:49,967
... that was the happiest time in my life.

614
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:59,354
That is a horrible story.
It's the worst story I've ever heard.

615
01:02:00,491 --> 01:02:05,486
And I aprreciate your words of comfort.
- I mean it, Andy.

616
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:09,411
Like a fucking job,
shit just happens to you.

617
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:15,882
Have you had a lot of success talking
jumpers in from window ledges?

618
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:23,252
May I ask you something?
- Sure.

619
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:30,100
How well do you know Tracy?
- She's my wife. What do you mean?

620
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:41,872
My brothers, my friends and my ex-husband...

621
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:47,415
... have all accused me of wielding my sense
of honesty like a blunt instrument.

622
01:02:47,588 --> 01:02:51,774
I don't want to hurt you anymore
than you've been but...

623
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:56,589
... I'm very sure I'm doing the right thing.

624
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:59,054
What are you talking about?

625
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:07,486
I want you to come back to the station with me.
I must show you something.

626
01:03:31,765 --> 01:03:35,931
Sir, sir can I help you?
- I'm here to see Jed Hill.

627
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:55,622
What the hell happened to you?
- It wasn't my baby.

628
01:03:55,641 --> 01:03:56,778
What?

629
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:58,913
It wasn't my baby.

630
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:02,174
Come inside.
What the hell happened to your face?

631
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,799
Doesn't matter.
You know what this is?

632
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:07,541
This is a police test.
A lab report.

633
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:08,844
I don't understand.

634
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:12,019
It's my sperm sample I left after
Paula Bell rape.

635
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:13,902
I'm sterile.

636
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:17,291
Can I have a look at that, please?

637
01:04:18,196 --> 01:04:22,037
I can't have any children, so it
wasn't my baby.

638
01:04:23,451 --> 01:04:24,592
You got to call your lawyer Jed.

639
01:04:24,956 --> 01:04:28,586
You call your lawyer, you haven't tell the
insurance company to stop the presses because...

640
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,327
... this thing. No, it's not over yet.

641
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:34,747
Oh, Andy. This isn't about me.
It's about both of us, Jed.

642
01:04:34,924 --> 01:04:38,874
She ruined both of us. It's too late for me
but it's not too late for you.

643
01:04:39,053 --> 01:04:42,837
Andy, I don't mean to seem indelicate but
as far as my situation is concerned...

644
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:46,634
... it doesn't matter if Tracy was sleeping
with the Boston Celtics.

645
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:49,986
I took out her reproductive system.

646
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:54,855
It was a wrong call and the bill was
20 million dollars.
- No.

647
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:59,159
That's where you're wrong. See, the
20 million dollars is a big settlement, right?

648
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,029
That wasn't for the fuck-up.
That... that was for the victim.

649
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:07,953
The insurance company settled high and fast because
they thought they're up against Snow White.

650
01:05:08,128 --> 01:05:12,511
What happens if Snow White is shacking up
with her lawyer Jed, huh?

651
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:14,442
You tell me.

652
01:05:14,597 --> 01:05:17,425
Andy, you're hurt & you
want revenge.

653
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:21,100
& I can understand that, but I got
what I deserved.

654
01:05:21,271 --> 01:05:24,854
and you know something,
as much as this pains you...

655
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:27,593
... no matter what Tracy was doing
behind your back...

656
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:32,526
she got a hell of a
lot worse than she deserved.

657
01:05:33,452 --> 01:05:36,025
Did I?

658
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:40,997
Did you what?
- Did I get what I deserved?

659
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:45,665
Bad things happen to good people all the time,
Andy & for no reason.

660
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,881
Take my word for it.

661
01:05:50,722 --> 01:05:52,762
I'll see you later.

662
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,061
What're you gotta do Andy?

663
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:01,309
I'm gonna go out and
get to know my wife.

664
01:06:16,285 --> 01:06:16,712
Hi Dennis!

665
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:18,876
He doesn't have an appointment, Mr. Riley.
He just walked right on.

666
01:06:19,152 --> 01:06:20,508
She tried to stop me, Dennis.

667
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:25,254
See, I can call him Dennis coz we're old friends.
We both slept with my wife.

668
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,965
Claudia, call security.
- Do that Claudia and then call the US Attorney's office...

669
01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:32,975
... and see if conspiracy to commit insurance fraud
comes under their jurisdiction.

670
01:06:33,147 --> 01:06:38,356
Forget security, Claudia. Just close the door
behind you. Thank you.

671
01:06:45,006 --> 01:06:51,292
This... This is a nice office.
- What the hell happened to your face?

672
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,753
I beat the shit out of a deeply
disturbed serial rapist.

673
01:06:56,984 --> 01:07:02,089
Hey, I want an explanation.
- An explanation for what?

674
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:07,094
For how my wife could have been pregnant
when her husband's sterile?

675
01:07:08,312 --> 01:07:11,398
What was it - Immaculate Conception?

676
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:15,980
If that's the case, Dennis, I wouldn't have settled for
20 million if I were you.

677
01:07:16,156 --> 01:07:18,695
Andy, I had no knowledge of this.

678
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,487
And I wasn't sleeping with your wife if
that's what you're suggesting.

679
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:27,744
Bullshit.
- Then what can I do for you, Andy?

680
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:29,961
You can tell me where Tracy is.

681
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:34,759
Telling you where Tracy is would break an Attorney-Client
privilege & I will not do that.

682
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:39,058
Now there is nothing more I can do.
Claudia'ill be happy to call the US Attorney for you.

683
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,343
Were you sleeping with her?

684
01:07:42,856 --> 01:07:43,837
No.

685
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:54,898
Can you help me?
- Help you do what? What is it you want Andy?

686
01:08:00,751 --> 01:08:05,080
I want to talk to Tracy.
I know I'm asking you a favour...

687
01:08:05,256 --> 01:08:08,672
I've a professional obligation.
I've a legal obligation to my client.

688
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:12,627
Your problems, your questions,
cold as this may seem are not my business.

689
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,677
And I haven't got the answers you want.
Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to give them to you.

690
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:20,016
Talk to her friends, talk to her
mother & talk to other people.

691
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,109
What did you say?
- I'm saying this is a personal matter.

692
01:08:23,278 --> 01:08:26,945
Did you say 'talk to her mother'?
- She certainly knows Tracy better than I do.

693
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:29,240
Her mother is dead.

694
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:33,077
When did she die?
- Twelve years ago.

695
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:36,333
You handled the estate.

696
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:39,504
No, I didn't.
- What're you saying to me?

697
01:08:39,672 --> 01:08:42,446
I'm saying I didn't handle Mrs. Kennsinger's
estate and anything

698
01:08:42,454 --> 01:08:44,428
else rather than framework of your
wife's lawsuit is not my...

699
01:08:44,635 --> 01:08:48,385
I don't give a fuck about the lawsuit. I'm asking...
- Then we have nothing here to talk about.

700
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,927
Is her mother alive?
Where does she live?

701
01:08:52,103 --> 01:08:55,806
Please understand...
- Fuck it. I'll find her myself.

702
01:08:56,295 --> 01:08:57,338
Andy...

703
01:08:59,111 --> 01:09:02,363
Scotch.
- What?

704
01:09:02,532 --> 01:09:05,107
Bring her a bottle of scotch.

705
01:09:28,313 --> 01:09:31,730
My name is Andy Safian.
- So what?

706
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:35,819
Did your daughter ever tell you
she had a husband?

707
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:38,990
Did your wife ever tell you
she had a mother?
- Yeah.

708
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:41,365
You're a liar.

709
01:09:41,537 --> 01:09:46,413
She said you were dead.
- What do you want from me?

710
01:09:46,585 --> 01:09:49,787
I... it's nothing. I just want...
- Nobody wants nothing.

711
01:09:50,923 --> 01:09:54,708
I thought maybe we could
have a drink and talk.

712
01:10:10,196 --> 01:10:14,990
She sure loved her daddy.
Second on the place of the best swindlers in Boston.

713
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:18,911
He taught her everything.
She was daddy's girl.

714
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,489
I wanted to ask you some questions.

715
01:10:21,668 --> 01:10:24,338
She tried to do the smart thing,
I give you that.

716
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:28,623
The smart thing. What was that?
- Marry a rich fellow. What do you think?

717
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,464
Tracy was married before?
- I said she tried.

718
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:35,848
You got to pay attention.

719
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:41,440
One of Bill's old partners, a guy from Newport.
Millionaire with a heart problem.

720
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:46,355
He wouldn't marry her though.
Not even after she got pregnant.

721
01:10:46,551 --> 01:10:47,959
Mrs. Kennsinger.

722
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:56,033
This is single malt scotch.
That was so classy Mister.

723
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:59,959
I haven't had single malt since '69.

724
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:05,292
I drink crap. Blended whisky is crap,
I don't give what colour the label is.

725
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,223
I need to find Tracy.

726
01:11:08,392 --> 01:11:11,261
Tell me the part again where she was
working with children's ward.

727
01:11:11,436 --> 01:11:15,815
I can tell you, she likes kids so she... .

728
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:18,881
What?

729
01:11:20,028 --> 01:11:20,967
What?

730
01:11:21,852 --> 01:11:23,365
Did I say something funny?

731
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:30,709
She indeed found herself a dork .
Like shooting tuna fish in a barrel.

732
01:11:34,087 --> 01:11:36,128
Big one too.

733
01:11:40,218 --> 01:11:43,470
You're drunk.
- And you're stupid.

734
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:48,559
I can say that to you because
you're my son-in-law.

735
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:54,567
Want to see something?
- I want you to tell me where Tracy is.

736
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:59,365
I'm older, I'm smarter.
You can learn something from me.

737
01:11:59,533 --> 01:12:02,488
I know she's been here.

738
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:05,239
Andy... is it Andy?

739
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:06,855
Yeah.

740
01:12:07,064 --> 01:12:07,897
Andy...

741
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:12,696
It's a simple trick.
- The statue...

742
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,267
What?

743
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:18,046
This, the Degas.
- What about it?

744
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:23,431
It was in my house. It was Tracy's.
So I know she's been here.

745
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:24,791
Andy...

746
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:30,903
Believe me. You need to see this trick.
- Do you get that I'm serious?

747
01:12:31,072 --> 01:12:34,323
I got it. Pick a card.

748
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,211
Look at it.

749
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:51,092
Put it back in the deck.

750
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:00,519
Shuffle the deck.

751
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,775
Mrs. Kennsinger, I don't want...
- You can call me 'Mom'.

752
01:13:05,823 --> 01:13:07,945
I don't think so.

753
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:12,907
Shuffle the cards. And shuffle them good.

754
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:20,789
We used to give Tracy some money each week
so she could buy candy. Shuffle the cards!

755
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:27,879
She won't spend it though, not a penny.
Each week she put it under the mattress.

756
01:13:28,974 --> 01:13:32,807
I swear I think there could
be $ 200 under the mattress.

757
01:13:33,895 --> 01:13:37,231
I'll tell you something else about Tracy...

758
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,277
I don't think it bothered her a bit when her father
cleaned up the bank accounts and disappeared.

759
01:13:44,075 --> 01:13:49,367
I think it bothered her when he took
the 200 dollars from under the mattress.

760
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:52,493
Jesus! what the hell kind of a family is this?

761
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:55,668
Want to bet?
- What?

762
01:13:55,838 --> 01:14:00,334
200 bucks. You will give me 200 bucks if I guess
where your card is else I give you 200 bucks.

763
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:01,623
No.

764
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,057
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

765
01:14:05,225 --> 01:14:06,969
Look, you said there was a point here and I... .

766
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:09,978
Why do you give a Frenchman's fuck who
she was sleeping with?

767
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:14,894
Get into the game.
Go for the 20 million yourself.

768
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:17,561
Are you saying that Tracy set this up?

769
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:21,903
What the hell have I been telling you?
Am I talking to my shadow?

770
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:26,034
You think you're Sherlock Holmes with this statue?

771
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:30,207
You can buy them in any departmental store...
89, 95. Looks just like the real thing.

772
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:36,086
The whole thing was a setup?
You're crazy.

773
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:38,074
Yeah?

774
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,759
Then how come I have the Jack of Clubs
in my fucking pocket?

775
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:56,200
Look kid, I don't know what the game is.

776
01:14:56,369 --> 01:14:59,820
But you got stung,
so did your friend, the surgeon.

777
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:04,493
Maybe, it's best to just take a medicine
like a good little boy and go home.

778
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:08,801
But do me a favour.
Leave me this scotch.

779
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:19,973
What happened to the baby? - What baby?
- The Newport millionaire, their baby.

780
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:24,103
She pocketed the money he
gave her for an abortion.

781
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:28,109
Went downtown to a clinic.
She ended up working for the doctor.

782
01:15:28,282 --> 01:15:30,440
And there's a happy ending.

783
01:15:30,617 --> 01:15:33,903
She disappeared with 80,000 dollars of
the clinic's money.

784
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:36,867
How much of that do you think I saw?
What was the name of the doctor?

785
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:38,953
How much you think I'm going to see
from this 20 million?

786
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:41,325
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield?

787
01:15:41,482 --> 01:15:43,516
How much do you think she's gonna give her dead mother?

788
01:15:43,593 --> 01:15:45,004
Was it?
- Was what what?

789
01:15:45,178 --> 01:15:47,216
You think you can drink like this
and remember a name?

790
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:50,472
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield?

791
01:15:53,312 --> 01:15:55,352
Welcome to the game.

792
01:16:26,476 --> 01:16:28,932
CODE BLUE
ANSWERING SERVICE

793
01:16:44,837 --> 01:16:45,932
Hello!

794
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:52,189
Excuse me.

795
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:55,840
Can I talk to your manager?

796
01:17:01,142 --> 01:17:04,808
Mr. Hearn leaves at 5 o'clock.
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

797
01:17:04,978 --> 01:17:07,516
I'm Dr. Lillianfield.
Mr. Hearn wanted me to come by to fill...

798
01:17:07,692 --> 01:17:11,821
... out a change of address card for your billing.

799
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,127
Is that Lillianfield?
- Yeah. David.

800
01:17:29,593 --> 01:17:35,512
Why don't you just write it on the back of the old
card and we'll take care of the rest tomorrow.

801
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:36,720
Thanks.

802
01:20:32,726 --> 01:20:34,766
Where is the key?

803
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,395
I'm soaked.

804
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:45,154
God! I'm freezing.

805
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,365
It's cold in here.

806
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:55,162
We must do something about the latch.

807
01:20:57,422 --> 01:21:00,175
Oh, this damn door is driving me crazy.

808
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:06,594
I am frozen through.

809
01:21:12,982 --> 01:21:15,021
Warm me up, I'm freezing.

810
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:23,942
Take me upstairs and fuck me.

811
01:24:04,435 --> 01:24:08,101
I should be heading back to town.
- We just got here.

812
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:11,358
I know, but it's broad daylight.

813
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:17,073
Relax. It's a done deal.
I'm getting the cheque on Monday.

814
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:21,994
What's wrong with you?

815
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,328
I got a letter today.
- From who?

816
01:24:26,503 --> 01:24:31,582
Whom, from whom. From Dr. Kessler.
- What did he say?

817
01:24:31,761 --> 01:24:33,775
He didn't say, Tracy. It was a letter.
He wrote.

818
01:24:34,088 --> 01:24:38,571
Jed, take a drink, take a pill, do whatever it is
you have to, but lighten the fuck up.

819
01:24:38,675 --> 01:24:40,239
What did he write?

820
01:24:42,148 --> 01:24:45,564
That he was sorry.
That he was very sorry.

821
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:48,277
That was thoughtful of him.

822
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,085
What?

823
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:56,492
That was. The man put himself at the top.
I was in the room. The bartender was just icing. .

824
01:24:56,664 --> 01:24:59,453
... but Kessler's  was the one who closed it.

825
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:06,426
Common, what more do you want from the man?
- I want him to know it.

826
01:25:06,592 --> 01:25:10,294
I want him to know that I was holding the strings.

827
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:14,472
He's sorry? Let him say he was sorry
about Mass General.

828
01:25:14,644 --> 01:25:17,848
When he says he was wrong, when he
says that I should have gotten the job then...

829
01:25:18,024 --> 01:25:22,152
... you talk about bygones being bygones.

830
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:35,750
In the meantime, I think I'll send him a postcard.
- There, that's the spirit.

831
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,049
A picture of me sitting under a
palm tree with 10 million dollars in one hand...

832
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:43,882
... and a copy of his 'God-complex'
memo in the other.

833
01:25:44,971 --> 01:25:47,677
With an inscription.
- What would it say?

834
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:51,470
It wouldn't say anything. It would read.
- Good going, Trace.

835
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,307
What would it read?

836
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:57,811
Never under-estimate a genius with
a 'chip on your shoulder'.

837
01:27:21,878 --> 01:27:23,918
What the fuck was that?

838
01:27:26,686 --> 01:27:27,936
Oh my God.

839
01:27:28,969 --> 01:27:31,008
Where did that come from?

840
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:34,715
Andy.
- What?

841
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:40,269
Andy's been here.
- What are you talking about?

842
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:45,193
He knows.
- Then why aren't the police knocking on the door?

843
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:49,035
Because he's playing with us.
- Andy?

844
01:27:49,203 --> 01:27:52,039
I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

845
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:56,074
How could he possibly...
- Well, let's think about that for a moment, shall we?.

846
01:27:56,253 --> 01:27:59,753
What could we have done wrong?
Let's retrace the plan...

847
01:27:59,923 --> 01:28:06,177
... and see if we can put our finger on a detail we
may have overlooked. One of us may have improvised.

848
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:09,718
One of us may have decided that to get
pregnant would double the money.

849
01:28:09,893 --> 01:28:13,667
It did double the money. Now I don't want
to hear about it anymore. It is history.

850
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,919
Oh, no. . no. No kidding.

851
01:28:15,315 --> 01:28:20,192
It's the present. It's the here and the now
and the needle in the haystack.

852
01:28:20,364 --> 01:28:21,750
Let me ask you something.

853
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:25,401
Once he found out he was sterile,
how long do you think it took him...

854
01:28:25,504 --> 01:28:28,199
... to figure out there was no Dr. Lillianfield?

855
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:33,084
Do you understand what I'm saying?
There wasn't supposed to be a baby.

856
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:39,342
I'll take care of Andy.

857
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,624
Don't get up.

858
01:29:08,213 --> 01:29:11,131
What happened to your face?

859
01:29:11,301 --> 01:29:12,711
I tripped.

860
01:29:13,803 --> 01:29:17,967
I heard they caught the guy, the rapist.
- Yeah.

861
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,383
Well, that must be a load off your mind.

862
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,807
Yeah, it's great to finally have
things back to normal.

863
01:29:26,514 --> 01:29:27,295
Andy...

864
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:31,571
They can be back to normal.

865
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,561
What's that?

866
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:35,378
Things.

867
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:39,121
Our life.

868
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:42,374
Remember me?

869
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,591
Tracy.
- What?

870
01:29:52,014 --> 01:29:54,255
I think you dropped your shoe.

871
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:01,190
What can I get you?
- We'll have two glasses of house wine.

872
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:03,897
Is Chardonnay alright?
- It'll be fine.

873
01:30:04,069 --> 01:30:06,312
Anything else?
- Some privacy.

874
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:14,167
Now I'm going to talk for a minute,
So it would be better if you don't interrupt me, okay?

875
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,785
I found a hypodermic needle in my bed.

876
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:22,083
I don't know who put it there,
it doesn't matter.

877
01:30:22,259 --> 01:30:26,008
What matters, is that I didn't think it was funny.

878
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:29,088
And as you well know,
I've a healthy sense of humour.

879
01:30:29,295 --> 01:30:31,971
So what I'm saying is this:

880
01:30:33,396 --> 01:30:38,439
Whoever played that joke is playing in a league
that's just not ready for it.

881
01:30:40,406 --> 01:30:44,275
Now I came here hoping we
could reach an understanding.

882
01:30:44,453 --> 01:30:50,124
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hold grudge on this one, Trace.
- Oh, go to cops. They'll call you crazy.

883
01:30:50,293 --> 01:30:54,076
While still we have another school, why don't you
try getting a teaching job? 'Happy Hunting', Andy.

884
01:30:54,226 --> 01:30:56,462
Sit the fuck down.
- What?

885
01:30:56,632 --> 01:31:01,424
I said, sit the fuck down.
I'm running the show now.

886
01:31:04,475 --> 01:31:07,262
You're running it with an empty hypodermic needle?

887
01:31:07,437 --> 01:31:10,308
I'm running it with trace amounts of Pergonal.

888
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,074
Here it is.

889
01:31:21,163 --> 01:31:25,717
Mam, would you happen to know anything
about a drug called Pergonal?

890
01:31:25,821 --> 01:31:26,864
I'm sorry.

891
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:28,789
Never mind.
That's alright.

892
01:31:31,217 --> 01:31:34,302
It's a fertility drug, Andy.
I was trying to get pregnant.

893
01:31:34,469 --> 01:31:39,381
A fertility drug.
That's exactly what the lab guys told me.

894
01:31:39,558 --> 01:31:43,225
But it turns out that Pergonal,
when it's injected in like massive quantities... .

895
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,600
... can actually create ovarian cysts.

896
01:31:46,775 --> 01:31:51,355
They gathered brilliant young surgeon around
Trace, coz you gave us all quite a scare.

897
01:31:51,531 --> 01:31:54,734
It dissolved in the ovaries, so
you don't have clue how much I was taking.

898
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:59,371
That's right.
It's not like I had a witness.

899
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:02,746
I mean if I had a witness who saw
Jed giving you the injections...

900
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,048
... you bought, both of you would be spending
the rest of your sexually active years... .

901
01:32:07,216 --> 01:32:11,962
... in a place where you'll work very good
such as prison laundry.

902
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:13,718
You're bluffing.

903
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:14,681
Tracy...

904
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:17,476
Right now, other than anything else in the world...

905
01:32:17,647 --> 01:32:21,726
... don't you wish I had finally gotten
around putting up the curtains in the bedroom?

906
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:24,432
Shit!

907
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:26,400
Are you alright?

908
01:32:28,493 --> 01:32:30,818
You should rinse your hands with some water.
- No, I'm fine.

909
01:32:30,995 --> 01:32:34,364
Are you sure? Let me just...
- I said I'm fine.

910
01:32:36,126 --> 01:32:38,533
You spilled your wine, Trace.

911
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:47,548
By the by, you should know in case some
bizarre active 'God' should happen to take my life...

912
01:32:47,723 --> 01:32:52,966
... my will's been amended to direct the police
to the 10-year old son of our next door neighbour.

913
01:32:53,146 --> 01:32:55,186
What do you want?

914
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,522
What does anybody want?
I want the Red Sox to win the World Series.

915
01:32:59,696 --> 01:33:01,558
You haven't taken the kid to the police.
What do you want?

916
01:33:01,975 --> 01:33:03,852
I had a chat with your mom.

917
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:09,872
Not bad looking for somebody who's
been dead for twelve years.

918
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:15,752
What do you want, Andy?
- I want to change my life, Tracy.

919
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:19,756
I don't think I'm overstating when I say
that she knows some pretty cold card tricks.

920
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,969
Cut the shit. What do you want?

921
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:27,637
I want half.
What the fuck do you think I want?

922
01:33:42,663 --> 01:33:44,157
Give him the money.

923
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,411
What?

924
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,370
Give the man the money,
and let's get out of here.

925
01:33:49,548 --> 01:33:52,632
Oh Jesus, Jed. . I need you to focus on this thing.

926
01:33:52,801 --> 01:33:57,546
I'm telling you precisely what to do. Give the guy
the 10 bucks and we leave the country.

927
01:33:57,723 --> 01:34:02,268
I'm supposed to split the money three ways?
I'm supposed to just accept this?

928
01:34:02,438 --> 01:34:05,772
Welcome to the land where you
don't have a choice.

929
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:09,191
Don't fucking turn on me.
I earned this money.

930
01:34:09,362 --> 01:34:13,692
This money is mine. He's not getting
a nickel. The cheque's in my name.

931
01:34:13,867 --> 01:34:15,906
Not in the prison, I doubt.

932
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:24,206
Without the kid, he doesn't have anything.

933
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:28,592
Without the kid, Andy is just a guy
who cracked under the strain.

934
01:34:28,952 --> 01:34:29,891
What?

935
01:34:31,639 --> 01:34:33,715
Absolutely.

936
01:34:35,892 --> 01:34:39,761
Do you know what you're saying?
- What's the big deal Jed?

937
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:44,650
You cut me open, stuck your hands
and twisted my ovaries so that I look all that dead.

938
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:48,273
Oh, excuse me, 'necrotic'. Now you develop
some enlightened sense of what's right and wrong?

939
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:49,861
He's a child.

940
01:34:50,036 --> 01:34:52,906
No, he's a little fucking troll who deserves
to be put out of his misery...

941
01:34:53,081 --> 01:34:56,117
... for fucking up my life.
Now if you don't have the balls to...

942
01:35:02,591 --> 01:35:04,799
Don't talk about this again.

943
01:35:07,097 --> 01:35:11,427
Anything happens to the kid and I'm
the State's star witness.

944
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:14,600
Give the man the money.

945
01:35:19,695 --> 01:35:21,735
I'm sorry I hit you.

946
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:34,455
Put it down.

947
01:35:36,673 --> 01:35:40,292
Which blood did you let
me lose before you saved me?

948
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,162
You waited an extra minute or two, didn't you?

949
01:35:42,268 --> 01:35:44,405
You thought about going the other
way after you saw I was pregnant.

950
01:35:44,457 --> 01:35:47,268
You thought for a second about
letting me die, didn't you?

951
01:35:47,434 --> 01:35:50,271
I'm a doctor.
- You were a doctor.

952
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:54,190
Don't overestimate yourself, Tracy.

953
01:35:56,698 --> 01:35:58,775
Give me the gun.

954
01:36:01,145 --> 01:36:01,979
Come on.

955
01:37:17,323 --> 01:37:19,863
It's me. I have the money.

956
01:37:21,038 --> 01:37:23,328
Where are you?
- At Market Square.

957
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:28,461
Meet me in the northwest corner
in fifteen minutes.

958
01:40:01,897 --> 01:40:04,056
Like shooting tuna in a barrel, huh?

959
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:33,322
I won't mind shooting you.

960
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:38,285
What took you so long?

961
01:40:38,462 --> 01:40:43,671
We were waiting for Jed.
- Somehow, I don't think he's going to show.

962
01:40:43,844 --> 01:40:45,886
Don't move. You need a doctor.

963
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:52,516
You hear that Trace?
We need a doctor.

964
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:28,890
You okay?
- I will be.

965
01:42:32,531 --> 01:42:36,662
You're supposed to put ice on that.
- I don't want any ice.

966
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:40,243
You need ice.

967
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:44,717
Fine.
I'll have mine in a glass of some scotch.

968
01:42:45,095 --> 01:42:45,721
Fine.

969
01:42:46,972 --> 01:42:51,104
Single malt. Nothing blended.
Blended whisky is crap.

970
01:42:52,274 --> 01:42:54,944
Somebody told me that once.

971
01:42:57,565 --> 01:43:10,213
