1
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:35,458
(birds chirping)

2
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,483
Boy:
LUTHER!

3
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,451
COME ON.

4
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,887
COME ON, CLIVE.
HURRY UP.

5
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,323
YOU'RE SLOW AS SHIT, CLIVE.

6
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:52,325
COME ON.

7
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,277
I'M COMING.

8
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:57,480
(panting)

9
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,450
LUTHER, WAIT UP!

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,208
COME ON.

11
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,228
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

12
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,248
I TOLD YOU IT WAS SOMETHING.

13
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,484
THE BASTARD FELL
FROM THE CLIFF.

14
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:37,654
THE GUN WENT OFF
AND HE SHOT HIMSELF,

15
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,589
DUMB OLD FUCKER.

16
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,559
COME ON OVER HERE.
COME ON NOW, CLIVE.

17
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,543
HE AIN'T GONNA BITE YOU.

18
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:47,013
LOOK WHAT I FOUND ON HIM.

19
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:50,283
THE BASTARD'S SHARP.

20
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:51,834
I REALLY DO GOTTA GO.

21
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:03,646
YOU AIN'T GONNA TELL NOBODY
ABOUT THIS, ARE YOU?

22
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,767
YOU AIN'T NOTHING
BUT CHICKENSHIT.

23
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:10,236
THIS IS OUR SECRET,

24
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,572
YOU HEAR ME?

25
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:04,234
Man:
MELISSA, IT WAS JUST
THE ONE TIME, I SWEAR.

26
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,752
Melissa:
OH, AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE IT OKAY?

27
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,537
Man:
COME ON, MEL.

28
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:12,492
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

29
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,443
I WISH I COULD
BELIEVE YOU.

30
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,461
I MEAN IT.

31
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,682
I NEED TIME TO THINK.

32
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,785
OKAY.

33
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,787
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.

34
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,772
UM, TOMORROW

35
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,540
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT
FOR DINNER.

36
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,942
I WON'T BE HERE
TOMORROW.

37
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:32,361
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

38
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:35,348
RAINERSPOINT.
I'VE GOT A PART IN A PLAY.

39
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,201
RAINERSPOINT?
WHERE'S THAT?

40
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:42,405
A LONG LONG WAY FROM HERE.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

41
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:43,957
WELL, HOW LONG
WILL YOU BE GONE?

42
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,876
THREE WEEKS, MAYBE A MONTH.
I DON'T KNOW.

43
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,364
OKAY.

44
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,084
WELL,

45
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:58,137
CAN I AT LEAST HELP YOU LOAD
YOUR THINGS INTO THE CAR?

46
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,740
NO, THANKS.

47
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,680
MELISSA,

48
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,299
I'M REALLY SORRY.

49
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:57,463
(pop song playing on radio)

50
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,983
(insects chirping)

51
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,698
YES!

52
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:53,820
(dials)

53
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,621
(bird screeches)

54
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,040
(tires screeching)

55
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,419
(owl hooting)

56
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,404
(heart beating)

57
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,738
(engine idling)

58
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:25,064
(water running)

59
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,869
(facet squeaks, water stops)

60
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:44,349
WELCOME, ROSALIE.

61
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:53,442
NOW I'M GONNA TAKE
REAL GOOD CARE OF YOU.

62
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,779
THAT'S RIGHT.

63
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,231
I'M GONNA GET YOU
ALL FIXED UP.

64
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,387
OH, YES, MA'AM.

65
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,775
YOU AIN'T GOT
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

66
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:18,133
I'M GONNA TAKE
REAL GOOD CARE OF YOU.

67
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,525
YOU'RE A GIFT.

68
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,948
YOU'RE A GIFT FROM GOD.

69
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,645
(distant children playing)

70
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,266
(cell phone rings)

71
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,055
HELLO.

72
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,057
YES, HELLO.
MY NAME IS JEROME.

73
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,992
I'M THE STAGE MANAGER
FOR "FIRES OF FREEDOM."

74
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,410
IS MELISSA THERE
BY ANY CHANCE?

75
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,064
UH, NO, SHE'S NOT.
I'M HER SISTER.

76
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:06,899
YEAH YEAH,
I KNOW, CATHY.

77
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,568
MELISSA HAS MENTIONED
YOU TO ME BEFORE.

78
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,153
AND BESIDES,
YOUR NAME AND NUMBER ARE
ON HER CONTACT SHEET.

79
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:13,656
You're who we're to notify
in case there's an emergency.

80
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,791
WHOA WHOA WHOA,
AN EMERGENCY?

81
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,126
HUH-UH, HUH-UH.
DON'T COME AT ME
WITH ALL THAT DRAMA.

82
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,079
IT AIN'T THAT DEEP.
SLOW YOUR ROLL, SISTER.

83
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,382
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO LOCATE HER.

84
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,118
For some reason or another
she hasn't arrived yet.

85
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,070
WELL, SHE LEFT
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

86
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,189
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THERE BY MIDNIGHT.

87
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,757
DID YOU CALL
HER MOTEL ROOM?

88
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:34,727
BABY, I HAVE BLOW-UPTUATED
THE PHONE LINES AT THE MOTEL.

89
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,745
SHE HASN'T CHECKED IN.

90
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,314
JEROME, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING.

91
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,083
THOSE KIDS WON'T STOP
MESSING WITH THE FOG MACHINE.

92
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,669
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING
ON MY NERVES, DON'T YOU?

93
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,174
ALL YOU KIDS ARE JUST
MAKING MY BOWELS LOCK UP!

94
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,660
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

95
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,530
LISTEN, HON,

96
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:57,366
IF YOU SEE YOUR SISTER,
PLEASE INFORM HER

97
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,202
THAT IF SHE ISN'T
HERE BY NOON TOMORROW,
WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE HER.

98
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,653
WELL, I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE THERE.

99
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,706
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
CIAO.

100
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:14,416
"BLUE SUEDE SHOES."
"BLUE SUEDE SHOES."

101
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,018
Man on TV:
"Blue Suede Shoes."

102
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,020
(laughs)
SEE?

103
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:20,523
"BLUE SUEDE SHOES,"
YOU IDIOT.

104
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:23,258
MORNING, DELLA.
GOT A DELIVERY FOR YOU.

105
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,677
HEY, JUSTIN.
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

106
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:29,565
WOULD IT HURT HER TO PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL SOMETIME?

107
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,617
WHO ARE THEY FOR?

108
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:34,020
MISS MELISSA ADAMS,
ROOM 108.

109
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,589
MIGHT AS WELL TAKE 'EM BACK.
SHE AIN'T HERE.

110
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,924
SUPPOSED TO CHECK INTO
HER ROOM LAST NIGHT,

111
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,909
BUT SHE NEVER SHOWED UP.

112
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,695
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING
THE WHOLE DAMN DAY
LOOKING FOR HER.

113
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,598
WELL, HOW ABOUT
HANGING ON TO 'EM FOR ME

114
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,266
JUST IN CASE SHE DOES
SHOW UP?

115
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,185
WHATEVER.

116
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:50,686
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, DELLA.

117
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,505
OKAY.  HEY...

118
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,091
TELL YOUR MAMA TO CALL ME.

119
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:08,770
"MELISSA, LOVE YOU LOTS.

120
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,723
DARIC."

121
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,176
Man on TV:
It is.

122
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:16,378
Congratulations, son.
You just won a bonus round.

123
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,581
HOT DAMN.
BONUS ROUND.

124
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,134
(engine starts)

125
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:28,323
(men chatting)

126
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,425
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

127
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,560
HMM?

128
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,263
LOOK AT 'EM.

129
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,747
SO ANYWAY, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA GET INTO TONIGHT?

130
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,749
A BUNCH OF PANSIES.

131
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,536
EVERY SUMMER
THIS TOWN'S TOOK OVER

132
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,721
BY PANSIES
AND DRUG ADDICTS--

133
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,790
"FIRES OF FREEDOM."

134
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,526
"FIRES OF FREEDOM"
BURN MY ASS.

135
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:50,045
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

136
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:53,716
I'D LIKE TO PUT A BULLET
IN THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA

137
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:56,335
OF THE BASTARD WHO THOUGHT UP
THAT DAMN PLAY.

138
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,437
YOU'RE JUST ANGRY BECAUSE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

139
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,439
A LITTLE WORK OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF MONTHS

140
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,209
INSTEAD OF SITTING AROUND
ON THAT FAT ASS OF YOURS.

141
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,678
WELL, I FIGURED
YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

142
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,031
IT'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO JACK THEM PRICES UP AGAIN.

143
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:13,636
I GOTTA ADMIT
THERE'S NOTHING I LIKE BETTER
THAN A LITTLE TOURIST MONEY.

144
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,804
(door slams)

145
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:19,458
WELL, I'LL BE.
AFTERNOON THERE, CLIVE.

146
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:42,548
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

147
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:45,300
NO, NOTHING, I SUPPOSE.

148
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:48,103
YOU KNOW, IN ALL THE YEARS
I'VE BEEN RUNNING THIS PLACE

149
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,005
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I CAN REMEMBER

150
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,990
CLIVE MERCER
COMING INTO MY STORE

151
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,576
TWICE IN THE SAME MONTH
TO BUY ANYTHING.

152
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:56,645
HUH.

153
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,139
THE OLD GOAT
MUST LOVE SOUP.

154
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,691
YEAH, THAT'S ALL
HE EVER BUYS--

155
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:09,975
CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP.

156
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,076
REALLY?

157
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,973
LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT BE DOING
A LITTLE BIT OF SPRING CLEANING.

158
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:27,259
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE?

159
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,795
MAYBE HE FORGOT
TO WIND HIS CLOCK.

160
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,930
I'M AFRAID OLD CLIVE
DOESN'T HAVE

161
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:34,266
A WHOLE LOT OF CLOCK
TO WIND.

162
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,802
HUH.

163
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,783
(distant train horn blowing)

164
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:21,613
(country music playing on radio)

165
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:24,033
(bells jingle)

166
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,259
Woman:
HEY, DON'T GO.

167
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,676
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

168
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,019
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU TODAY?

169
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,855
MISS BENTLEY?

170
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,524
MISS BENTLEY?

171
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,759
SHE'S DEAD, HON.

172
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,128
BEEN DEAD, WHAT,

173
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,714
10 YEARS, I GUESS?

174
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,466
THIS IS MY PLACE NOW.

175
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:00,302
THE NAME'S JEWEL.
WHAT'S YOURS?

176
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,570
MY NAME IS CLIVE MERCER.

177
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:05,658
WELL, CLIVE, WHAT MIGHT YOU
BE LOOKING FOR TODAY?

178
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,960
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?

179
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,728
SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF MAYBE?

180
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,932
OR PERHAPS SOMETHING
FOR THE LITTLE LADY?

181
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,069
WONDERFUL.

182
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,953
FOLLOW ME.

183
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:21,407
NOW THIS IS WHERE MOST OF
THE LADIES START.

184
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,409
AND THEY GO ON AROUND BACK

185
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,911
TO THE UNDIES AND THINGS,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

186
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,313
SO WHAT'LL IT BE?

187
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:34,486
OOH, NO, NOT THAT ONE.

188
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:37,656
FOR CHRISSAKE,
THAT'S A FASHION SUICIDE.

189
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:41,042
I THINK I'D BETTER HELP.
WHAT SIZE IS SHE?

190
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,078
I CAN TELL ALMOST EVERYTHING
ABOUT A WOMAN

191
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,031
BY WHAT SIZE SHE WEARS.

192
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:48,834
OH, COME ON,
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
WHAT SIZE SHE IS.

193
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:52,238
IS SHE A SIX OR A SEVEN?

194
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,823
IS SHE ABOUT MY SIZE?

195
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:57,826
I'M NOT SURE, MA'AM.

196
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,781
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THESE MANNEQUINS?

197
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:05,917
COULD ONE OF THEM
BE HER SIZE?

198
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,707
I SEE SOMETHING
HAS CAUGHT YOUR EYE.

199
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:18,130
BUT-- BUT THAT'S
A WEDDING DRESS.

200
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,616
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

201
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:38,033
Man over phone:
Listen, I'm afraid
our hands are tied

202
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,918
until 48 hours
from now.

203
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,787
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO CHECK
INTO HER MOTEL ROOM

204
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,789
LAST NIGHT
AT RAINERSPOINT, TENNESSEE,

205
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,158
BUT SHE NEVER ARRIVED.
AND NOBODY'S SEEN HER.

206
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,260
AND SHE HASN'T
CALLED ANYBODY.

207
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:51,480
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED, I KNOW IT.

208
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,949
Man:
Let's hope not, ma'am.
If she was going to Tennessee,

209
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,168
you might want to call
local law enforcement
out there.

210
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:59,070
They can probably do more
for you right now
than we can.

211
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,072
I MIGHT JUST DO THAT.

212
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,509
THANK YOU, SERGEANT.

213
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,994
Well, if you don't
hear from your sister
by this time tomorrow,

214
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,645
let us know.
We'll see what we can do.

215
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:18,974
- I KNOW IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE.
- (clattering)

216
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:25,113
I'M NOT GIVING UP,
ROSALIE.

217
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:27,115
I KNOW IT'S HERE.

218
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,217
(clattering continues)

219
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,424
(fly buzzing)

220
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,746
I FOUND IT.

221
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:44,967
I FOUND IT--
MAMA'S PICTURE BOOK.

222
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:47,386
(owl hooting)

223
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,989
THIS HERE IS MY DADDY.

224
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,124
HE DIED WHEN I WAS
REAL YOUNG.

225
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,143
THEY FOUND HIM
DOWN BY THE CREEK

226
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:59,414
WHERE HE GOT KICKED
IN THE HEAD BY HIS HORSE.

227
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,500
HE WAS A GOOD MAN,
MAMA SAID.

228
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,687
NOW THIS HERE--

229
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:07,806
THIS HERE'S MAMA.

230
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,775
SHE'S PRETTY, ISN'T SHE?

231
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:13,495
SHE WAS ONLY 15
WHEN THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

232
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,681
AND THAT WOMAN
STANDING THERE BESIDE HER--

233
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,683
THAT WAS HER MAMA.

234
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:20,135
THAT'D BE MY GRANDMA.

235
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,122
THEM FLOWERS
THEY'S HOLDING--

236
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,507
THOSE ARE ROSES.

237
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,361
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY HAVE FLOWERS.

238
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:37,753
I KNOW SOME
OF THESE PEOPLE, BUT--

239
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:39,404
WELL, THEY MUST BE KIN,

240
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:41,923
OR MAMA WOULDN'T HAVE
PUT THEM IN HERE,

241
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:45,727
BUT I CAN'T THINK
OF THEIR NAMES RIGHT NOW.

242
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:48,113
WELL, THAT'S HOW
I AM SOMETIMES.

243
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,817
I MEAN, I HAVE GOOD DAYS
AND BAD DAYS FOR REMEMBERING.

244
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,302
(chuckles)

245
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:57,205
SEE, I KNOW
THESE RASCALS.

246
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,975
SEE, THAT LITTLE BABY
RIGHT THERE--

247
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,076
THAT'S ME.

248
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,695
(laughs)

249
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,314
AND THAT'S
MY BROTHER NATHAN.

250
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:07,316
HE WAS FIVE YEARS
OLDER THAN ME.

251
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:12,738
OH, AND THIS IS NATHAN
IN HIS UNIFORM.

252
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,707
HE JOINED THE ARMY
RIGHT AS SOON AS HE
GOT OUT OF SCHOOL.

253
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,260
A VIET CONGER
SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD

254
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,262
WITH A SNIPER'S BULLET

255
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,931
AS SOON AS
HE GOT OVER THERE.

256
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,686
HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER
RUN OFF

257
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:31,156
AND LEFT ME AND MAMA
LIKE THAT.

258
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:34,460
HIM GETTING KILLED CAUSED
MAMA TO HAVE ANOTHER STROKE

259
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:37,295
AND SHE NEVER COULD
EVEN WALK AFTER THAT.

260
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,027
THIS HERE--

261
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:55,580
THIS IS ROSALIE HOBART.

262
00:23:55,581 --> 00:24:00,285
SHE WAS A NURSE
THAT DOC MOSLEY SENT OVER

263
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:04,305
AFTER MAMA HAD
HER STROKE.

264
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,329
SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN
THAT I EVER MET

265
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,915
THAT TREATED ME
LIKE I WAS SOMEBODY

266
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,835
AND NOT JUST LIKE
SOME RETARD,

267
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,688
LIKE MOST PEOPLE DO.

268
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,559
SHE STAYED WITH US
FOR 10 YEARS.

269
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,979
AND THEN

270
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,864
ONE DAY SHE JUST
DIDN'T COME ANYMORE.

271
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:32,884
AND I HEARD
THAT SHE GOT MARRIED

272
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:35,086
AND MOVED AWAY.

273
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:43,395
THAT NURSE THEY SENT AFTER HER
WAS JUST MEAN.

274
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,880
SHE WAS MEAN, SPITEFUL.

275
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:50,919
SHE'S THE ONE THAT CAUSED
ALL THAT TROUBLE FOR ME.

276
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,788
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE
OTHER PEOPLE ARE WITH MAMA,

277
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,291
BUT THOSE BUILDINGS
UP THERE--

278
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,976
MAMA SAID
THAT THAT USED TO BE

279
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:00,128
ALL THERE WAS
OF DOWNTOWN RAINERSPOINT.

280
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,647
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

281
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:04,917
IT SURE HAS CHANGED
SINCE THEN, AIN'T IT?

282
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,421
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU--

283
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:13,074
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
DOWNTOWN RAINERSPOINT,
HAVE YOU?

284
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,977
WELL, WE CAN FIX THAT,
BY GOLLY.

285
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,646
WE CAN FIX THAT.

286
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,347
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
SUNDAY MORNING

287
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:22,250
WE'LL GET IN THE CAR
AND WE'LL GO FOR A RIDE.

288
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,636
AND I'LL SHOW YOU
SOME SIGHTS.

289
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:30,858
I CAN'T FIND
MY OTHER CARD.

290
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,444
COULD YOU JUST
CHECK IT AGAIN, PLEASE?

291
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:36,047
RUN THE NUMBER
AND CHECK THE NAME.

292
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:38,516
IT'S A "C", NOT A "K".

293
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,702
IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I GET ON THE ROAD

294
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:43,655
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

295
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:45,691
OKAY, BUT YOU'LL CALL ME
RIGHT BACK?

296
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:47,659
OKAY, THANKS.

297
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,820
HEY.

298
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,822
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DARIC?

299
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:05,243
WELL, IT'S ABOUT MELISSA.

300
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,312
WHAT ABOUT HER?

301
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:10,348
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HER--

302
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,650
SINCE SHE LEFT FOR
RAINERSPOINT, I MEAN?

303
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,387
NO.  WHY?

304
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:19,040
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO WORRY YOU OR ANYTHING,

305
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,042
BUT I THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

306
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,845
I HAD SOME FLOWERS
WIRED TO HER MOTEL ROOM
THIS MORNING,

307
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,446
BUT THE FLORIST
CALLED ME BACK AND SAID

308
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:27,615
HE COULDN'T DELIVER THEM
'CAUSE SHE WASN'T THERE.

309
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:29,701
HE SAID THAT SHE HADN'T
EVEN CHECKED IN YET.

310
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,169
I KNOW.

311
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,588
NOBODY UP THERE HAS A CLUE
WHERE SHE IS.

312
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,624
IT'S LIKE SHE JUST
VANISHED SOMEHOW.

313
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:39,494
THE WORST PART IS,
NO ONE REALLY SEEMS
ALL THAT CONCERNED--

314
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:42,563
NOBODY BUT ME.
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA GO
LOOK FOR HER MYSELF.

315
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:46,051
HEY, WAIT.
DO YOU WANT TO RIDE WITH ME?

316
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:47,602
YOU'RE GOING
TO RAINERSPOINT?

317
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:50,238
YEAH, I ALREADY GOT
THE MAP AND EVERYTHING.

318
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,293
LOOK, I STILL LOVE
YOUR SISTER

319
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,729
DESPITE WHAT YOU
MIGHT THINK.

320
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:02,600
SO DO YOU WANT
A RIDE OR--?

321
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,136
ALL RIGHT.

322
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:05,971
BUT I'M PAYING
FOR MY SHARE OF THE GAS.

323
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,489
- FAIR ENOUGH.
- (phone rings)

324
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,775
I HAVE TO GET THIS.

325
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:13,194
- HELLO.
- Melissa Adams's sister?

326
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:14,629
YES, WHO IS THIS?

327
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,098
THIS IS JEROME.
I'M CALLING TO INFORM YOU

328
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,100
THAT THE NOON DEADLINE
HAS PASSED.

329
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:22,187
THEREFORE, YOUR SISTER
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY FIRED
FROM OUR PRODUCTION.

330
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:24,289
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

331
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,075
TAKE YOUR FUCKING PLAY
AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS.

332
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,276
CIAO.

333
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,780
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

334
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:56,137
I'M SORRY TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR SO LONG, ROSALIE,

335
00:27:56,138 --> 00:27:57,905
BUT THAT MAILMAN--
HE WAS AWFUL LATE.

336
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,376
OH LORD.

337
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:05,146
OH.

338
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,682
OH, ROSALIE,

339
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:10,618
THERE NOW, THERE.

340
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,854
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
FINE NOW.

341
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:16,107
THAT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

342
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,543
(sniffing)

343
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,763
OH.

344
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:25,550
THIS HEAT.

345
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:29,955
I'M GONNA FIX YOU
A BATH, OKAY?

346
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:34,359
WE GOTTA KEEP YOU
PRETTY AND ALL.

347
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:51,493
SO YOU'RE SURE THIS IS
THE WAY MELISSA WENT?

348
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,495
YEAH.

349
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,163
I'M SURE.

350
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,033
I'VE DRIVEN UP HERE
WITH HER BEFORE

351
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,269
WHEN SHE WAS STILL
AUDITIONING FOR PARTS.

352
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,937
OH.

353
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:06,441
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
WE'LL TRACK HER DOWN?

354
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:11,446
WELL, I WAS THINKING
WE'D STOP AT THE GAS STATIONS
ALONG THE WAY

355
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:14,649
AND WE'D ASK THE MANAGERS
IF THEY'D SEEN HER.

356
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,719
RIGHT.

357
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,088
I'M SURE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

358
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,074
THE ONE THING
MELISSA DOES BEST

359
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,676
IS TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

360
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:27,678
YEAH.

361
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,014
YOU'RE RIGHT.

362
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,349
THIS NICE COOL BATH
OUGHT TO HELP.

363
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,388
I GOT SOME STUFF
THAT'S GONNA KEEP YOU
SMELLING NICE.

364
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,383
I'LL JUST USE
THE WHOLE THING.

365
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:36,047
MAYBE WE SHOULD SHAMPOO
YOUR HAIR A LITTLE BIT.

366
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:48,659
(humming a tune)

367
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:58,186
YOU LIKE THAT HYMN?

368
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,138
MAMA USED TO
SING THAT TO ME

369
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,090
WHEN I WASN'T FEELING
ALL THAT WELL.

370
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:06,661
THERE'S WORDS TO IT,

371
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,997
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER 'EM
RIGHT NOW.

372
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:26,164
WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH
SHAMPOO.

373
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:28,800
WE'LL GET YOU
RINSED OFF.

374
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:34,422
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
REAL PRETTY TONIGHT, ROSALIE.

375
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:37,409
I GOT SOMETHING REAL SPECIAL
PLANNED FOR YOU.

376
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,317
(distant train horn blows)

377
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,898
CATHY, WE'VE WASTED
A LOT OF TIME

378
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,900
STOPPING AT PLACES
LIKE THIS.

379
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:06,338
NOW ACCORDING TO THE MAP,

380
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:09,190
WE'RE JUST 30 MILES
FROM RAINERSPOINT.

381
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:11,242
DON'T YOU THINK IT'D BE BEST
IF WE JUST WENT AHEAD

382
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,795
AND DROVE THE REST
OF THE WAY THERE?

383
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,797
DARIC, THE ONLY REASON
I STOPPED

384
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:19,050
IS BECAUSE WE'RE NEARLY
OUT OF GAS.

385
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,802
OH.

386
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,322
BUT WHILE YOU'RE PUMPING IT,
I MIGHT AS WELL SHOW THEM
MEL'S PICTURE.

387
00:32:24,323 --> 00:32:26,758
IT'S YOUR TURN TO PAY,
BY THE WAY.

388
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,785
(country song playing on radio)

389
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,159
HELLO?

390
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,427
- HEY.
- HEY.

391
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:48,963
- YOU GETTING GAS?
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE PAYING
AT THE PUMP.

392
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:52,100
OH, WELL, YOU WANT
SOME CIGARETTES?

393
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,135
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

394
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:56,036
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD HELP ME.

395
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:58,105
- WELL, SURE.
- GREAT.

396
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:01,108
RING ME UP, HONEY.
I'M IN A BIG HURRY.

397
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,527
I GOT ME A HOT DATE.

398
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:08,266
OF COURSE, I COULD ALWAYS
CANCEL IT.

399
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:10,268
TAKE THIS BEER
YOU GOT RIGHT HERE,

400
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:11,953
PUT IT RIGHT BACK
IN THE COOLER,

401
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:13,955
'CAUSE I AIN'T
SELLING IT TO YOU.

402
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:16,090
I'M A FULL-GROWN MAN.

403
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,626
I'M OVER 21 YEARS OLD.

404
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:20,612
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE 91.

405
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,447
I STILL AIN'T SELLING YOU
THAT BEER.

406
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,516
- WHY THE HELL NOT?
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY--

407
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,785
BECAUSE MY BEST FRIEND'S
HUSBAND WAS KILLED BY
A DRUNK DRIVER LAST MONTH,

408
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:29,721
LEAVING HER WITH NO MONEY
COMING IN

409
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:31,338
AND THREE LITTLE BABIES
TO FEED.

410
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:33,374
AND FROM THAT DAY ON
I VOWED

411
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,978
THAT NO ALCOHOL OF ANY KIND
WOULD BE SOLD ON MY SHIFT.

412
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,714
NOW YOU CAN REPORT ME
TO MY BOSS

413
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:43,183
AND YOU CAN GET ME FIRED.
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS

414
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:45,737
'CAUSE I GOT PRINCIPLES.

415
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:48,689
YOU'RE A CRAZY BITCH.

416
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,226
HERE'S YOUR MONEY.
THIS IS MY BEER.

417
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:54,362
- NO.
- GIVE ME THAT BEER.

418
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:55,463
GIVE ME THE BE--

419
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:58,399
(groans)

420
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,773
I'M SORRY.

421
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:09,276
WHAT WAS IT
I COULD HELP YOU WITH?

422
00:34:09,277 --> 00:34:11,663
- COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PICTURE?
- SURE.

423
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:14,098
THAT'S MY SISTER.
SHE'S MISSING.

424
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,001
NO ONE'S SEEN HER
IN TWO DAYS.

425
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,253
OH, WAIT A MINUTE NOW.
I HAVE.

426
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:21,255
- YOU HAVE?
- WELL, YES.

427
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:23,758
SHE STOPPED IN HERE
TO GET GAS AND BUY A MAP.

428
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,793
SHE SAID SHE WAS HEADING
FOR RAINERSPOINT

429
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,829
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
IF SHE WAS ON THE RIGHT ROAD.

430
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,747
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

431
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,049
NO, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

432
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,384
THANK YOU.

433
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,653
MY PLEASURE.
AND I HOPE YOU FIND HER.

434
00:34:35,654 --> 00:34:37,755
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

435
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:39,957
(door opens and closes)

436
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:32,810
A DOG TICK.

437
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,796
(snaps)

438
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:38,616
(owl hooting)

439
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,458
(hissing)

440
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:14,244
(bluegrass waltz playing)

441
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,278
I SURE HOPE
YOU LIKE SOUP.

442
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:35,482
I'M NOT MUCH GOOD
AT COOKING.

443
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:38,819
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH
ALL I EAT.

444
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,923
BUT I EXPECT THAT MIGHT CHANGE
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

445
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:44,158
(chuckles)

446
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,502
THERE NOW.

447
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:02,860
I'LL SAY THE BLESSING.

448
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,579
GOD IS GREAT.  GOD IS GOOD.
LET US THANK HIM TO OUR FOOD.

449
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,415
BY HIS HANDS WE ALL ARE FED.
GIVE US, LORD, OUR DAILY BREAD.

450
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,384
AMEN.

451
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,859
THIS IS GONNA BE
A SPECIAL NIGHT, ROSALIE,

452
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,163
SPECIAL FOR BOTH OF US.

453
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:25,833
OH, I GOT A BIG SURPRISE
FOR YOU AFTER SUPPER.

454
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,719
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAY
NOTHING ELSE.

455
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,322
I WANT TO KEEP YOU
GUESSING.

456
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,929
I PRAYED AND PRAYED

457
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,931
THAT THE LORD WOULD
SEND ME SOMEBODY

458
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:58,916
TO SPEND MY LAST YEARS WITH
HERE,

459
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,435
SO THAT I WOULDN'T
BE ALONE.

460
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,821
AND MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME

461
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:06,691
THAT IF YOU PRAY
LONG ENOUGH AND HARD ENOUGH,

462
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:09,360
YOUR PRAYERS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

463
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:17,118
MAMA WOULD APPROVE
OF YOU.

464
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,574
(sniffs)

465
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:27,111
YOU SMELL LIKE MAMA.

466
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:51,002
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO HOT
FOR YOU, ROSALIE.

467
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:53,437
USUALLY I DON'T EVEN BOTHER
HEATING THIS STUFF UP.

468
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:58,342
MM, IT'S GOOD HOT.

469
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:02,596
(burps)

470
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,651
SORRY.

471
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:10,454
IN CHINA THAT MEANS
YOU LIKE YOUR SUPPER.

472
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,350
JESUS.

473
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,885
THIS PLACE IS CREEPY.

474
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:29,273
IT'S NOT EVEN 10:00
AND EVERYTHING IS CLOSED.

475
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:31,975
THE MOTEL IS STILL OPEN.

476
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,512
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

477
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,499
(bluegrass song playing)

478
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,518
 When I was single 

479
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,403
 Marrying was
all I craved 

480
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:45,823
 But now I am married,
Lord 

481
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,292
 I'm troubled
to my grave 

482
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:50,895
 Lord, I wish I was
a single girl again... 

483
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:53,531
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

484
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,284
 Dishes to wash 

485
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,720
 And springs to go to 

486
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:01,989
 I've got no one
to help me, Lord 

487
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,824
 I have it all to do 

488
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,826
 Lord, I wish I was
a single girl again... 

489
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,811
IT WAS MY MAMA'S,

490
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:10,264
AND HER GRANDMA'S
BEFORE THAT.

491
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:15,869
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

492
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,155
 Both of them
so hungry, Lord 

493
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,658
 They can't raise up
their heads 

494
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:24,829
 Lord, I wish I was
a single girl again... 

495
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,797
(music continues)

496
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:34,471
(exhales)

497
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:36,490
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU

498
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:39,343
THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
IN RAINERSPOINT.

499
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:42,980
ANYTHING YOU WANT
I'LL GET YOU.

500
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:48,585
'CAUSE YOU ARE
GOD'S GIFT TO ME, ROSALIE,

501
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,904
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

502
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:53,874
YOU HAVE THE BEST
THAT ANY WOMAN COULD WANT.

503
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,713
I LOVE YOU, ROSALIE.

504
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:02,683
 I wish I was dead 

505
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:06,720
 Lord, I wish I was
a single girl again... 

506
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:10,274
OH.

507
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:12,376
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

508
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:15,028
I-- I'M SORRY.

509
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:18,131
I'M SORRY.
I UNDERSTAND.

510
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:21,001
I JUST BETTER GET
THESE DISHES

511
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:23,671
BACK TO THE KITCHEN.

512
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:26,807
I'M SORRY.

513
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:38,436
OH, MAN.

514
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:41,088
IT FEELS GOOD
TO STRETCH OUT.

515
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:43,724
YOU CARED A LOT FOR MEL,
DIDN'T YOU?

516
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:46,110
I STILL DO.

517
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:47,411
I LOVE HER.

518
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:50,597
THEN WHY DID YOU
SCREW AROUND ON HER?

519
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:54,501
WELL,

520
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:57,104
IT'S LIKE I TOLD MEL--

521
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,273
IT WAS JUST A LAPSE
IN JUDGMENT.

522
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:01,709
I KNOW IT'S AN AWFULLY
PAT ANSWER,

523
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,677
BUT IT'S THE BEST
I'VE GOT.

524
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:06,413
MEL SAID SHE WAS
ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS.

525
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:08,866
YEAH.

526
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:12,253
SHE WAS IN THIS PHOTOGRAPHY
COURSE THAT I WAS INSTRUCTING.

527
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:14,121
SHE WAS ALWAYS
FLIRTING WITH ME.

528
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:17,391
AND THEN ONE NIGHT
SHE VOLUNTEERED TO STAY BEHIND

529
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:21,311
AND HELP ME CHANGE
THE CHEMICALS IN THE DARKROOM.

530
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,797
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

531
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:26,117
AND I FELT GUILTY AS HELL
WHEN IT WAS OVER.

532
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,739
AND YOU'VE BEEN ONE
MISERABLE BASTARD EVER SINCE?

533
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,840
ABSOLUTELY.

534
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,312
OH, MAN.

535
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:43,701
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

536
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:47,637
I MEAN, YOU KNOW MEL
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

537
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:50,307
YOU THINK SHE'LL EVER
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE?

538
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:54,695
STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

539
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:56,881
SO YOU STILL THINK
THERE'S HOPE?

540
00:43:56,882 --> 00:44:00,400
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS.

541
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,088
WE SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

542
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:05,790
WE'VE GOT A LONG DAY
AHEAD OF US.

543
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,841
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

544
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:18,069
HEY...

545
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,654
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GONNA FIND HER.

546
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:23,107
I JUST HAVE THIS
GUT FEELING, YOU KNOW?

547
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:24,875
I KNOW.

548
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:29,446
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

549
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,432
GOOD NIGHT.

550
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:33,417
THANKS FOR COMING ALONG,
DARIC.

551
00:44:33,418 --> 00:44:34,851
NO PROBLEM.

552
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:43,493
WELL, ROSALIE,
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.

553
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:47,197
NOW I PROMISED YOU
A RIDE INTO TOWN.

554
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:49,449
IT'LL BE GOOD.

555
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,451
WE CAN GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER.

556
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:54,521
IT'LL DO YOU SOME GOOD
TO GET OUT FOR SOME FRESH AIR.

557
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:56,823
OH, MY.

558
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,677
MAMA'S SUMMER HAT
JUST SUITS YOU TO A "T",
DON'T IT?

559
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,382
(air conditioner humming)

560
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,989
ORDER UP, WANDA.

561
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,609
Sheriff:
HE SEES ME AND HE MAKES
A BEELINE RIGHT FOR ME

562
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,444
JUST A-SWINGING THAT
TIRE IRON OVER HIS HEAD

563
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:19,446
AND KAI-YAYING.
(laughs)

564
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:21,715
OF COURSE, HE'S DRUNKER
THAN NINE MIDGETS IN A VOLVO,

565
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:23,717
SO HE WINDS UP
TRIPPING OVER HIS OWN FEET,

566
00:45:23,718 --> 00:45:25,719
STICKING THAT TIRE IRON
THROUGH HIS LEG.

567
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,721
CONSIDERING HE WAS
NAKED AS A JAYBIRD,

568
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:29,657
IT PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN
A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT WORSE.

569
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:31,659
JOHNNY RAY NEVER COULD
HOLD HIS LIQUOR.

570
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,328
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

571
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,684
SEE, ROSALIE?

572
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:45,155
AIN'T IT EVERYTHING
I SAID IT'D BE?

573
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:46,923
LOOK.
LOOK RIGHT OVER THERE.

574
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:49,026
THAT'S MR. WEBBER'S
SHOE STORE.

575
00:45:49,027 --> 00:45:51,028
HE'S THE MAN THAT MADE
THESE BOOTS FOR ME

576
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:54,064
WAY LONG TIME AGO.

577
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:55,949
AND LOOK RIGHT THERE.

578
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,485
THAT'S THE SHOP WHERE
I GOT THE DRESS FOR YOU.

579
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:04,425
OH, AND LOOK
RIGHT OVER THERE.

580
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:06,460
THAT'S WHERE--

581
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:08,879
(tires screech,
crash)

582
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:17,204
SHERIFF, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO COME SEE THIS.

583
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,491
DAMN IT TO HELL.

584
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:24,428
I WISH YOU PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
WOULD LEARN HOW TO DRIVE.

585
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:27,214
ISN'T THAT
OLD CLIVE MERCER?

586
00:46:27,215 --> 00:46:29,516
YEAH, BUT WHO'S THAT WOMAN
IN THE CAR WITH HIM?

587
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:31,218
I DON'T KNOW.

588
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,186
ALL RIGHT.

589
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,625
(engine grinding)

590
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:43,514
I WAS TRYING
TO EAT MY BREAKFAST.

591
00:46:43,515 --> 00:46:45,432
WHAT ARE YOU MONKEY NUTS
DOING OUT HERE?

592
00:46:47,468 --> 00:46:49,803
ALL RIGHT, JUST HANG BACK.
LET ME TALK TO HIM FOR A SECOND.

593
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:52,022
(engine grinding)

594
00:46:52,023 --> 00:46:56,643
HEY, BUDDY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

595
00:46:56,644 --> 00:47:00,514
YOU ALMOST HIT
THAT BOY'S TRUCK.

596
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:03,283
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
OUT HERE?

597
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:06,019
WELL, ASK HIM, SHERIFF.
HE'S THE ONE ABOUT HIT ME.

598
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,557
GOD, MAN, WHAT YOU GOT
IN THERE, A SKUNK?

599
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:17,948
HEY.
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT.

600
00:47:19,017 --> 00:47:21,701
WHOA WHOA WHOA.
HEY HEY HEY.

601
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:23,654
GET BACK HERE, DAMN IT.

602
00:47:23,655 --> 00:47:25,906
OH, LORD.

603
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:28,809
OH, ROSALIE, I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER TOOK YOU OUT
IN THIS HEAT.

604
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,478
OH, I'M SO STUPID
SOMETIMES.

605
00:47:49,948 --> 00:47:52,049
(footsteps)

606
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:05,395
(exclaims)

607
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:09,315
WELL, HEY THERE, BECKY.

608
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:12,702
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WALKING
ALONE, ALL BY YOURSELF, HUH?

609
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:14,971
MAMA SENT ME TO THE STORE.

610
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,874
OH?

611
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,892
WHAT YOU GOT IN THERE?

612
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:20,727
JUST GROCERIES, IS ALL.

613
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:23,062
OH, IS THAT SO?

614
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:25,416
I GOTTA GET HOME,
MR. SPOOLE.

615
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,751
- FIRST YOU'RE COMING
HOME WITH ME.
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

616
00:48:27,752 --> 00:48:30,671
YEAH, WE'LL JUST
CUT THROUGH THE WOODS
SO AS NOBODY COULD SEE.

617
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:33,223
STOP.

618
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:41,164
WELL, I'LL BE
A SON OF A BITCH.

619
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,934
OW!

620
00:48:43,935 --> 00:48:46,937
IF YOU TELL YOUR MAMA AND DADDY,
I'LL GET YOU WHERE YOU SLEEP!

621
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:49,506
YOU HEAR ME?

622
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:10,944
CLIVE, CLIVE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

623
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:18,702
CLIVE!

624
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:22,756
CLIVE.

625
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,526
OPEN UP.

626
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,432
NOW I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A GIRL IN THERE.

627
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:40,857
HELLO, LUTHER.

628
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:43,293
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

629
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:46,613
I AIN'T SEEN YOU
IN A COON'S AGE.

630
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:48,882
CUT THE SHIT, CLIVE.

631
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:51,351
I WANT TO MEET
THE WOMAN IN THE HOUSE.

632
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:53,403
AND DON'T TRY LYING,
ACTING LIKE SHE AIN'T HERE,

633
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:56,290
'CAUSE I SEEN YOU WITH HER
ABOUT A MINUTE AGO.

634
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:03,947
SHE'S NOT UP TO MEETING
NOBODY RIGHT NOW.

635
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:06,032
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM TOWN

636
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:10,587
AND SHE'S AWFUL TIRED.

637
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:12,905
WELL, WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

638
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:14,608
WHERE IS SHE FROM?

639
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:17,911
SHE'S JUST A COUSIN,
IS ALL,

640
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:22,282
UH, FROM POLK COUNTY.

641
00:50:22,283 --> 00:50:26,152
AND SHE'S JUST GONNA STAY
A FEW DAYS

642
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:29,456
AND GO BACK.

643
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:36,196
LAST TIME WE TALKED YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T HAVE NO KIN.

644
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:39,215
YOU SAID YOU WAS
THE LAST ONE.

645
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,585
(spits)

646
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:43,987
WHO IS SHE, CLIVE?

647
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:46,506
COME ON, YOU CAN TRUST ME.

648
00:50:46,507 --> 00:50:49,726
WHAT, IS SHE SOME GAL
YOU MET SOMEWHERE,

649
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,728
MAYBE AN UGLY ONE,

650
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:54,364
MAYBE ONE THAT COULDN'T GET
NO OTHER MAN?

651
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,436
HEY, HAVE YOU
PUT IT TO HER YET?

652
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:12,983
I THINK IT'D BE BEST
IF YOU LEFT NOW.

653
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:15,085
WHAT DID I DO?

654
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:18,388
YOU GET OFF MY PROPERTY!

655
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:20,324
I MEAN IT!

656
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:29,482
OKAY.  OKAY.

657
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:32,285
I DON'T WANT
NO TROUBLE, CLIVE.

658
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,854
LOOK, I'M LEAVING.

659
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:12,025
THAT THERE'S
LUTHER SPOOLE.

660
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:14,027
HE THINKS
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE,

661
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:16,830
BUT HE'S NOT.

662
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:19,466
HE'S A DIRTY ONE.

663
00:52:22,837 --> 00:52:24,938
OH, ROSALIE.

664
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:32,245
I CAN'T PAY HIM
NO NEVERMIND RIGHT NOW.

665
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:35,015
YOU'RE THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

666
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:39,702
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
RIGHT AT ALL.

667
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,691
I MIGHT NEED TO GET
SOME MORE STUFF,

668
00:52:44,692 --> 00:52:47,544
MAYBE GIVE YOU
ANOTHER BATH.

669
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:56,787
MAYBE IF I LET YOU
SOAK FOR A WHILE...

670
00:53:09,484 --> 00:53:12,686
(slurping)

671
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:15,539
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOOT
EGG-SUCKING DOGS.

672
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,107
(laughs)

673
00:53:17,108 --> 00:53:19,859
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

674
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,027
NEVER MIND.

675
00:53:21,028 --> 00:53:22,963
YOKE'S MY FAVORITE PART.

676
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:26,250
SHERIFF BULLOCK.

677
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:27,784
YEAH?

678
00:53:27,785 --> 00:53:29,786
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU
IF WE COULD.

679
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:32,422
CAN IT WAIT TILL I'M DONE
EATING BREAKFAST?

680
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:33,923
NO, IT CAN'T.

681
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:35,925
MY SISTER'S BEEN MISSING
FOR OVER TWO DAYS NOW.

682
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:38,678
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GET BACK TO THE STORE.

683
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:42,049
MY NEPHEW'S GONNA STEAL ME
BLIND IF I'M GONE TOO LONG.

684
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,783
I GOTTA GET MYSELF.

685
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:45,785
I GOT THREE OIL CHANGES
WAITING ON ME

686
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:47,787
BACK AT THE STATION.

687
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:50,740
YOU TAKE A MINUTE
AND YOU TALK TO THESE
NICE FOLKS, OKAY?

688
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:52,175
SEE YOU LATER.

689
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:58,064
THANK YOU.

690
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:00,834
THIS IS HER PICTURE.

691
00:54:20,054 --> 00:54:22,805
(slurping)

692
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:33,099
YOU SAY
THIS SISTER OF YOURS

693
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,368
IS AN ACTRESS?

694
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:37,387
THAT'S RIGHT.

695
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:40,807
(chuckles)

696
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:44,077
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT ACTORS--

697
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:46,746
THEY'RE A FLIGHTY BUNCH.

698
00:54:46,747 --> 00:54:49,866
THEY LIKE LIVING LIFE
IN THE FAST LANE.

699
00:54:49,867 --> 00:54:52,786
WHEN THEY BLOW
INTO TOWN HERE EVERY YEAR
TO DO THAT DAMN PLAY

700
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:54,921
THEY FIND OUT PRETTY
BY-GOD QUICK

701
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,774
THIS AIN'T NEW YORK
OR LALA-WOOD.

702
00:54:57,775 --> 00:54:59,659
RAINERSPOINT'S DOWNRIGHT
BORING TO THEM.

703
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,378
THERE AIN'T NO COCAINE PARTIES
OR SEX ORGIES

704
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:04,648
TO SATISFY THEIR
DECADENT LIFESTYLES.

705
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,666
AND EVERY YEAR
THERE'S ALWAYS A FEW OF 'EM--

706
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:09,169
USUALLY FIRST-TIMERS
JUST LIKE YOUR SISTER--

707
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,588
WHO WIND UP QUITTING

708
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:14,908
'CAUSE THEY JUST
CAN'T HACK IT.

709
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:17,293
SHERIFF...

710
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:19,563
(chuckles)

711
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,581
MY SISTER NEVER HAD
A CHANCE TO FIND OUT

712
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:23,350
IF RAINERSPOINT
WAS BORING OR NOT.

713
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:25,468
WE THINK SHE DISAPPEARED
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE

714
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:28,021
AND A GAS STATION
30 MILES AWAY.

715
00:55:28,022 --> 00:55:30,557
NOW WE WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

716
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:32,759
IF YOU HELPED US
FIND HER.

717
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,760
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MISSY?

718
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:37,614
THIS MIGHT COME AS A REAL
BIG SHOCK TO YOU

719
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:40,467
AND MR. FOOTLOOSE
OVER HERE,

720
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:43,937
BUT WE GOT A WHOLE LOT MORE
IMPORTANT PROBLEMS TO TAKE
CARE OF RIGHT NOW,

721
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:45,839
PROBLEMS THAT TAKE
PRIORITY

722
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,142
OVER LOOKING FOR SOME
MISSING ACTRESS.

723
00:55:49,143 --> 00:55:51,311
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

724
00:55:51,312 --> 00:55:53,363
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE
THAT PICTURE,

725
00:55:53,364 --> 00:55:55,348
I WILL TRY
TO SHOW IT AROUND

726
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,683
IF I GET THE TIME.

727
00:55:57,684 --> 00:55:59,035
HOW ABOUT THAT?

728
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,974
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED HIM A LARDASS.

729
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:06,276
NOW HE'LL NEVER
HELP US.

730
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:08,512
HE WASN'T GONNA HELP US
TO BEGIN WITH, DARIC.

731
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:10,380
WE'RE ON OUR OWN.

732
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:12,248
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

733
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,651
WE STOP EVERYBODY WE SEE
AND WE SHOW THEM
MEL'S PICTURE.

734
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:17,086
WE BUG THE HELL OUT OF THEM
IF WE HAVE TO.

735
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:20,123
SOMEBODY IN THIS SCREWED-UP
TOWN HAS SEEN HER.

736
00:56:23,895 --> 00:56:27,731
ALL RIGHT, CLIVE.

737
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:30,033
THAT'S GONNA BE $13.83.

738
00:56:30,034 --> 00:56:33,470
SORRY WE ONLY HAD
SIX BOTTLES OF DISINFECTANT.

739
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:35,505
YOU PRETTY MUCH
CLEANED US OUT.

740
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:37,874
WE'LL GET SOME MORE IN
NEXT WEEK.

741
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,844
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, CLIVE?

742
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:44,548
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU IN TOWN
AS MUCH AS I HAVE THIS WEEK.

743
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:46,649
YOU GOT COMPANY?

744
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,237
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

745
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:53,356
I'M NOT SURE.

746
00:56:53,357 --> 00:56:55,742
BUT I GOT AN IDEA.

747
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:58,144
I JUST HOPE TO GOD
I'M WRONG.

748
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,078
(door squeaks)

749
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,961
UH, AHEM.

750
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:51,030
HOWDY, MA'AM.

751
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:53,699
MY NAME'S LUTHER--

752
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,070
LUTHER SPOOLE.

753
00:57:59,906 --> 00:58:02,842
I LIVE CLOSE BY.

754
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:09,015
I HOPE I DIDN'T
WAKE YOU UP.

755
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:14,337
YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

756
00:58:28,953 --> 00:58:31,037
I JUST THOUGHT

757
00:58:31,038 --> 00:58:35,325
I'D STOP BY
AND VISIT YOU A SPELL.

758
00:58:35,326 --> 00:58:37,844
CLIVE SAYS THAT YOU--

759
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:50,156
OH, SHIT.

760
00:58:50,157 --> 00:58:52,592
(spits)

761
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:01,334
(flies buzzing)

762
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,706
(chuckles)

763
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:10,143
(doorbell jingles)

764
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:15,565
WELCOME...

765
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,801
TO MY WONDERLAND

766
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:21,938
OF LEFTOVERS AND JUNK.

767
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:23,806
MY NAME IS JEWEL.

768
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:26,176
- HI, I'M CATHY.
- I'M DARIC.

769
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:28,244
IT'S A PLEASURE.

770
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:29,846
WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU COULD HELP US.

771
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:31,948
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

772
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:33,816
YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PERSON.

773
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:35,852
I KNOW ALMOST
EVERYONE IN TOWN.

774
00:59:35,853 --> 00:59:37,020
ICE TEA?

775
00:59:37,021 --> 00:59:39,456
NO, THANK YOU.

776
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:42,025
THIS IS MY SISTER.

777
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:46,979
SHE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR OVER TWO DAYS NOW.

778
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:52,535
I'M SORRY,
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

779
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:55,655
I'D REMEMBER THAT FACE--

780
00:59:55,656 --> 00:59:58,291
VERY EXPRESSIVE.

781
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:00,059
WHAT SIZE IS SHE?

782
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,261
SIZE?

783
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:03,696
WHAT SIZE DOES SHE WEAR?

784
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:06,549
I CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT A PERSON
BY THEIR SIZE.

785
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:10,487
SHE'S A 6, I THINK.

786
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:12,255
NICE.

787
01:00:12,256 --> 01:00:14,924
NOT TOO MANY WOMEN IN THIS
TOWN BUYING SIZE 6,

788
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:17,560
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
(laughs)

789
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:19,979
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
SOMEBODY WAS IN HERE
THE OTHER DAY,

790
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,298
GOT MY WEDDING DRESS
I BOUGHT AT A YARD SALE.

791
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:23,566
IT WAS SIZE 6.

792
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,035
COULD THAT HAVE BEEN
MY SISTER?

793
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:27,904
OH NO, IT WAS A MAN.

794
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:30,106
HE SAID HIS NAME
WAS CLYDE.

795
01:00:30,107 --> 01:00:33,126
WALKED WITH A LIMP,
LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WITH HIS LEG.

796
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:36,762
I DON'T BELIEVE
HE'S ALL THERE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

797
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,664
DID HE SAY
WHO HE BOUGHT IT FOR?

798
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:41,183
YEAH, THE LITTLE LADY.

799
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:42,902
THANK YOU.

800
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:45,604
SURE I CAN'T INTEREST YOU
IN A BARGAIN?

801
01:00:45,605 --> 01:00:48,641
OH, NO, THANKS.
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT HELP.

802
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:50,910
I HOPE YOU FIND HER.

803
01:00:50,911 --> 01:00:52,878
WE WILL.

804
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:56,432
CATHY, WAIT UP.

805
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,334
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
WHO THAT GUY WAS.

806
01:00:58,335 --> 01:01:00,536
LOOK, A GUY WALKS
INTO THE STORE
AND HE BUYS A DRESS

807
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:03,706
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
THE SAME SIZE AS
YOUR SISTER.

808
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,742
SO?  THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM
A KIDNAPPER.

809
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:06,976
HOW DOES THAT MAKE
ANY SENSE?

810
01:01:06,977 --> 01:01:09,478
SENSE?  GOD, DARIC,
NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE.

811
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,397
OKAY OKAY, CALM DOWN.
OKAY.

812
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:13,482
LOOK, WE NEED TO ASK AROUND
A LITTLE BIT

813
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:15,651
BEFORE WE STARTS ACCUSING
SOMEONE OF KIDNAPPING.

814
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:18,655
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS
ACCUSATION, OKAY?

815
01:01:18,656 --> 01:01:21,006
SO LET'S ASK AROUND FIRST.

816
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,376
ALL RIGHT?

817
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:00,013
ROSALIE, I'M BACK.

818
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:02,932
THE STORE DIDN'T HAVE
EVERYTHING THAT I NEEDED, BUT--

819
01:02:04,568 --> 01:02:06,535
ROSALIE!

820
01:02:14,228 --> 01:02:16,179
ROSALIE.

821
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:20,616
ROSALIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

822
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:23,519
ROSALIE.

823
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,323
WHERE--?

824
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:39,969
ROSALIE.

825
01:02:46,243 --> 01:02:48,243
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES?

826
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:50,245
- HEY.
- HI.

827
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:53,148
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU'D HAD ANY LUCK
FINDING YOUR SISTER.

828
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,951
NO, WE HAVEN'T.

829
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:56,969
OH, I'M SORRY.

830
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,039
WE WERE TALKING TO THE LADY
WHO OWNS THE THRIFT STORE
A FEW MINUTES AGO AND--

831
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,575
- JEWEL?
- YES.

832
01:03:02,576 --> 01:03:04,360
SHE WAS TELLING US
ABOUT A MAN

833
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:07,263
WHO CAME IN THERE
THE OTHER DAY.
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

834
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:09,148
UH, CLYDE.

835
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:11,550
CLYDE.  HE WALKED
WITH A LIMP AND HE--

836
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:13,970
CLIVE.
CLIVE MERCER.

837
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:15,821
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

838
01:03:15,822 --> 01:03:18,090
A LITTLE, YEAH.

839
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:20,210
WHAT DID HE DO?

840
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:22,295
HE BOUGHT
A WEDDING DRESS.

841
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:24,964
HE TOLD HER IT WAS
FOR THE LITTLE LADY.

842
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:30,320
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

843
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:34,023
COME HERE.

844
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,062
MAYBE I DO,
MAYBE I DON'T.

845
01:03:40,063 --> 01:03:42,298
I AIN'T 100% SURE.

846
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:45,318
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

847
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:48,337
CLIVE'S BEEN
IN MY STORE TWICE.

848
01:03:48,338 --> 01:03:51,357
HE BOUGHT SOME DISINFECTANT
AND SOME EXTRA CANS OF SOUP,

849
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:53,359
YOU KNOW, LIKE THERE WAS
SOMEBODY UP THERE

850
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,396
THAT HE HAD TO FEED.

851
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:58,497
IT'S A WOMAN.

852
01:03:58,498 --> 01:04:00,849
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE
I SAW HER IN THE CAR
WITH HIM THIS MORNING

853
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,851
WHEN HE DROVE
THROUGH TOWN.

854
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,921
WHERE DOES THIS
CLIVE GUY LIVE?

855
01:04:04,922 --> 01:04:06,972
ON THE OTHER END OF TOWN,
OFF KNOB HILL ROAD.

856
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:09,008
IT'S WHERE ALL THE OTHER
CRAZIES LIVE.

857
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:11,494
LOOK, DON'T YOU GUYS
GO UP THERE ALONE.

858
01:04:11,495 --> 01:04:14,931
YOU TAKE THE SHERIFF
WITH YOU IF YOU GO.

859
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:06,316
(twig snaps)

860
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,159
SHIT.

861
01:05:57,968 --> 01:05:59,468
WHERE IS SHE?

862
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:01,920
DAMN IT, CLIVE.

863
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:05,057
JESUS CHRIST.
I WAS GONNA BRING HER BACK.

864
01:06:05,058 --> 01:06:07,109
I JUST WANTED--

865
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,245
(gagging)

866
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:13,082
WHERE IS SHE?

867
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,793
NOT HIM.

868
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,251
NOT HIM!

869
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:40,809
YOU STUPID BASTARD.

870
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,946
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT A REAL MAN CAN DO.

871
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,632
(screaming)

872
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,835
HEY.  HEY.

873
01:07:22,836 --> 01:07:24,904
SHE STINKS.

874
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:26,456
(laughs)

875
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,125
(thunder rumbling)

876
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:42,338
WELL, HE'S THE ONLY
MERCER ON THE ROAD.

877
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:44,924
IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

878
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:47,876
LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD
GO BACK AND GET THE SHERIFF.

879
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:51,180
DAMN IT, DARIC,
WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME.

880
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,065
IF HE HAS MEL UP THERE,
THERE'S NO TELLING

881
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:55,384
WHAT HE'S BEEN
DOING TO HER.

882
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:56,685
LET'S GO.

883
01:07:56,686 --> 01:07:59,255
LOOK LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW HE'S GONNA REACT

884
01:07:59,256 --> 01:08:01,690
WHEN HE SEES A STRANGER
ON HIS PROPERTY.

885
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:05,594
I THINK MAYBE
I SHOULD GO ALONE.

886
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:07,613
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

887
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:10,015
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE CRAZY.

888
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:13,151
WHAT?  HAVE YOU HAD THAT
ON YOU THE WHOLE TIME?

889
01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:14,820
IS IT LOADED?

890
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:16,822
DARIC.

891
01:08:16,823 --> 01:08:18,340
OKAY OKAY, LISTEN.

892
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:20,008
I'LL GO
SCOPE OUT THE HOUSE.

893
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,961
YOU STAY HERE
AND GET ON YOUR CELL PHONE

894
01:08:21,962 --> 01:08:23,946
AND TRY TO GET AHOLD
OF THE SHERIFF.

895
01:08:23,947 --> 01:08:25,965
GET HIM UP HERE.

896
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:27,466
FINE.

897
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,834
BUT TAKE THIS.

898
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:31,237
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IF HE SEES ME WITH THAT,

899
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:33,306
HE'LL GO STRAIGHT
FOR HIS SHOTGUN

900
01:08:33,307 --> 01:08:35,224
OR CROSSBOW
OR WHATEVER.

901
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:38,093
I'LL TAKE THIS INSTEAD.

902
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:41,397
IF HE THINKS I'M A HARMLESS
WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHER,

903
01:08:41,398 --> 01:08:43,799
HE'LL BE LESS INCLINED
TO BLOW MY HEAD OFF.

904
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:48,504
OKAY.

905
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:01,917
(thunder crashing)

906
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:04,720
IT'S JUST THUNDER.

907
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:06,722
YEAH, WELL,

908
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:08,757
WHERE THERE'S THUNDER
THERE'S LIGHTNING.

909
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:11,093
HEY, LOOK,

910
01:09:11,094 --> 01:09:13,095
IF IT STARTS TO RAIN
BEFORE I GET BACK,

911
01:09:13,096 --> 01:09:14,647
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS.

912
01:09:14,648 --> 01:09:18,150
I'D HATE TO RUIN
THE UPHOLSTERY.

913
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:19,752
DARIC,

914
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:21,153
BE CAREFUL.

915
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:23,806
WELL, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

916
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:25,808
I'M JUST OUT
FOR A FRIENDLY STROLL

917
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:28,527
IN THE LAND
OF "DELIVERANCE."

918
01:09:40,473 --> 01:09:42,441
(rhythmic knocking)

919
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:51,449
(knocking continues)

920
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:28,888
(thunder rumbling)

921
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:40,666
(flies buzzing)

922
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:03,238
HELLO?

923
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:05,207
MR. MERCER?

924
01:11:08,828 --> 01:11:11,430
MY NAME IS DARIC LOMAX.

925
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:15,801
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT, IF I COULD.

926
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,459
MR. MERCER?

927
01:11:59,195 --> 01:12:01,897
MR. MERCER?

928
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,067
(thunder crashing)

929
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:44,789
OH MY GOD.

930
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:51,146
MELISSA!

931
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:18,633
(metal rattles)

932
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:23,805
UH, HELLO?

933
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:28,494
MR. MERCER.

934
01:14:28,495 --> 01:14:30,179
(clears throat)

935
01:14:43,242 --> 01:14:45,543
(door closes)

936
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:56,705
HELLO?

937
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:02,261
WHO'S THERE?

938
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,215
(screaming)

939
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:23,198
CATHY!

940
01:15:25,368 --> 01:15:28,904
CATHY!
CATHY, CALL FOR HELP!

941
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:39,815
NO!  NO!

942
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:49,491
(thunder crashing)

943
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,529
Man:
Sorry to keep you
waiting, ma'am.

944
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,032
Sheriff Bullock's
at lunch right now.
Can I take a message?

945
01:15:57,033 --> 01:15:58,834
YEAH.

946
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:00,769
TELL HIM IF HE DOESN'T
GET UP TO THE MERCER PLACE

947
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,354
AND HELP ME FIND
MY SISTER,

948
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:04,890
THEN I'M GONNA KICK
HIS FAT ASS ALL THE WAY
DOWN MAIN STREET.

949
01:16:06,393 --> 01:16:08,360
(rain pattering)

950
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:33,846
HELLO.

951
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:36,297
MR. MERCER, I'M...

952
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:39,684
CATHY.

953
01:17:39,685 --> 01:17:42,654
THAT FELLER
WHO WAS UP HERE BEFORE--

954
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:45,023
HE SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
COME UP

955
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:46,825
IF HE WAS GONE
TOO LONG.

956
01:17:46,826 --> 01:17:48,427
DARIC.

957
01:17:49,963 --> 01:17:51,947
HE'S NOT HERE?

958
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:54,649
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

959
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,953
UH...

960
01:17:57,954 --> 01:18:00,005
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND

961
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:02,407
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT HER.

962
01:18:02,408 --> 01:18:05,577
SO I SENT HIM UP
TO LUTHER'S

963
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:07,830
SO THAT HE COULD
ASK HIM.

964
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:12,184
HOW WOULD I GET
TO THIS LUTHER'S?

965
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:14,953
OH, WELL, FROM HERE

966
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:17,055
YOU JUST TAKE THAT
LITTLE TRAIL BACK YONDER.

967
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:20,225
AND IT ONLY TAKES
ABOUT 10 MINUTES

968
01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:22,227
IF YOU DON'T GET LOST.

969
01:18:22,228 --> 01:18:24,263
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T GO
UP THERE NOW,

970
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,730
NOT IN THIS WEATHER.

971
01:18:25,731 --> 01:18:27,166
UH...

972
01:18:28,485 --> 01:18:30,785
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
COME IN

973
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:34,005
AND WAIT FOR HIM
TO GET BACK?

974
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,245
I COULD MAKE US
SOME COFFEE.

975
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:45,834
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

976
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,428
(coughs)

977
01:18:56,429 --> 01:19:00,232
OH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT SMELL.

978
01:19:02,702 --> 01:19:05,570
THAT DANG SEPTIC TANK'S
BEEN BACKED UP ALL WEEK.

979
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:08,890
OH, IT'S OKAY.

980
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:14,029
SO...

981
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:16,448
DO YOU KNOW
THAT FELLER'S GIRLFRIEND?

982
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:18,683
I'M HER SISTER.

983
01:19:18,684 --> 01:19:21,119
SISTER?

984
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,472
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE HER PICTURE?

985
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:26,892
ALL RIGHT.

986
01:19:36,502 --> 01:19:39,554
SHE SURE IS
A PRETTY THING,

987
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:41,873
JUST LIKE YOU.

988
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:44,526
HER NAME'S MELISSA--
MELISSA ADAMS.
WE BOTH HAVE--

989
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:47,712
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ALL THAT.

990
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:55,837
THERE'S YOUR PICTURE BACK.

991
01:19:59,642 --> 01:20:01,810
HOW ABOUT THAT COFFEE?

992
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:04,179
OH, YEAH.
I'M SORRY.

993
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,415
I'M SORRY.
COMING RIGHT UP.

994
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:28,720
(Cathy coughing)

995
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:55,613
I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE.

996
01:20:57,883 --> 01:20:59,650
OKAY.

997
01:21:09,078 --> 01:21:11,179
(flies buzzing)

998
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:23,475
(coughing)

999
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:35,754
OH.

1000
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:38,423
HEY.

1001
01:21:38,424 --> 01:21:41,142
I WAS GONNA
BRING IT IN THERE.

1002
01:21:41,143 --> 01:21:44,546
I DON'T LIKE
BEING ALONE.

1003
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:46,965
OH.

1004
01:21:46,966 --> 01:21:49,601
ME NEITHER.

1005
01:21:49,602 --> 01:21:52,053
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

1006
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,541
OKAY, HERE YOU GO,
ROSALIE.

1007
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,409
NOW THIS IS GONNA BE

1008
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,328
THE BEST CUP OF COFFEE
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

1009
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:02,397
I PROMISE.
I GUARANTEE IT.

1010
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:08,103
OH.

1011
01:22:08,104 --> 01:22:10,121
OH, LORD.

1012
01:22:10,122 --> 01:22:12,123
I FORGOT TO PUT
THE COFFEE IN THERE.

1013
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:14,859
I'M SORRY.
I'LL GET IT.

1014
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,738
(exclaiming quietly)

1015
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:21,943
ROSALIE.

1016
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:28,483
- (water dripping)
- (panting)

1017
01:23:42,098 --> 01:23:44,066
(exclaiming)

1018
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:48,437
(coughing)

1019
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:17,165
(coughing)

1020
01:24:40,839 --> 01:24:42,307
(screaming)

1021
01:24:51,116 --> 01:24:53,084
(crying)

1022
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,916
(coughs)

1023
01:25:28,386 --> 01:25:30,855
WELL, THAT DIDN'T
SOUND GOOD.

1024
01:25:30,856 --> 01:25:32,690
WHAT THE HELL?

1025
01:25:32,691 --> 01:25:33,991
THERE IT IS.

1026
01:25:33,992 --> 01:25:36,627
THAT'S OVER
BY KNOB HILL ROAD.

1027
01:25:36,628 --> 01:25:39,113
OH, DAMN.

1028
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:41,132
OH, DAMN WHAT?

1029
01:25:41,133 --> 01:25:44,252
YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE
WHO WERE LOOKING FOR THAT
MISSING GIRL?

1030
01:25:44,253 --> 01:25:46,188
I SORT OF TOLD THEM
THAT I THOUGHT

1031
01:25:46,189 --> 01:25:48,289
CLIVE MERCER
JUST MIGHT HAVE HER.

1032
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,741
- YOU WHAT?
- I TOLD THEM NOT TO GO
OUT THERE WITHOUT YOU.

1033
01:25:50,742 --> 01:25:54,812
HOLLIS, YOU DUMBASS,
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE
GOT SOME PEOPLE KILLED.

1034
01:25:54,813 --> 01:25:57,599
HELL, I GOTTA GO
UP THERE NOW.  COME ON.

1035
01:26:08,494 --> 01:26:10,895
(Cathy banging, whimpering)

1036
01:26:15,251 --> 01:26:16,918
OH, NO NO NO.

1037
01:26:36,606 --> 01:26:39,456
(grunts)

1038
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:51,102
(grunts)

1039
01:27:00,896 --> 01:27:03,547
(exclaims)

1040
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:28,940
(grunts)

1041
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:55,733
(Cathy screams)

1042
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,635
WHY ARE YOU ACTING
THIS WAY, ROSALIE?

1043
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:35,990
(grunts)

1044
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:38,393
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU, ROSALIE?

1045
01:28:38,394 --> 01:28:41,362
I'M NOT FUCKING ROSALIE!

1046
01:28:44,483 --> 01:28:47,468
NO, NOT YET.

1047
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:50,121
BUT YOU SOON WILL BE.

1048
01:28:56,845 --> 01:28:59,314
THIS TIME, ROSALIE,
IT'LL BE BETTER.

1049
01:28:59,315 --> 01:29:01,148
I PROMISE.

1050
01:29:01,149 --> 01:29:02,917
LUTHER CAN'T HURT YOU
NO MORE.

1051
01:29:05,354 --> 01:29:07,288
NOW STOP ALL THIS.

1052
01:29:12,428 --> 01:29:15,430
WE'LL BE HAPPY AGAIN SOON,
YOU'LL SEE.

1053
01:29:21,137 --> 01:29:23,938
(grunting, panting)

1054
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:40,338
(exclaims)

1055
01:29:43,242 --> 01:29:46,411
(grunting)

1056
01:30:03,262 --> 01:30:05,396
THAT'S ENOUGH, ROSALIE.

1057
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:07,332
GO TO HELL!

1058
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:10,535
(screams)

1059
01:30:13,572 --> 01:30:16,374
YOU SICK FUCK.

1060
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,349
(siren wailing)

1061
01:30:37,296 --> 01:30:39,964
I ONLY WANT TO MAKE YOU
HAPPY, ROSALIE.

1062
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:41,799
(gunshot)

1063
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,936
CLIVE, PUT IT DOWN.

1064
01:30:45,937 --> 01:30:47,572
I MEAN WHAT I SAY,
GOD DAMN IT.

1065
01:30:49,107 --> 01:30:52,644
I JUST WANT TO START OVER,
IS ALL.

1066
01:30:52,645 --> 01:30:54,945
- IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
- CLIVE, DON'T BE A FOOL.

1067
01:30:57,983 --> 01:31:01,352
CLIVE, GOD DAMN IT,
I'M NOT SHITTING YOU.

1068
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:04,088
I WILL FUCKING BLOW YOUR
HEAD CLEAN OFF!

1069
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:07,425
I LOVE YOU, ROSALIE.

1070
01:31:07,426 --> 01:31:08,493
NO!

1071
01:31:11,997 --> 01:31:13,631
(screams)

1072
01:31:13,632 --> 01:31:16,000
- (screaming)
- JESUS, GIRL.

1073
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:18,102
(Clive continues screaming)

1074
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,582
CAN YOU WALK?

1075
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:56,841
DARIC, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

1076
01:31:56,842 --> 01:31:58,876
IT'S OKAY.

1077
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:03,247
I'LL CALL AN AMBULANCE.

1078
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:18,146
SONS OF BITCHIN'
OUT-OF-TOWNERS.

1079
01:32:19,948 --> 01:32:22,216
(rock music playing)

1080
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,981
 MY FACE MAY NOT BE 

1081
01:32:36,982 --> 01:32:39,984
 THE ONE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 

1082
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:43,687
 I'VE GOT THE VOICE 

1083
01:32:43,688 --> 01:32:46,424
 BUT YOU WANT
SOMETHING MORE 

1084
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,996
 NO MEANING LEFT

1085
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:55,366
 A PACKAGE SIGNED
AND SEALED BY YOU 

1086
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:57,535
 BUT I DON'T CARE 

1087
01:32:57,536 --> 01:33:02,140
 'CAUSE I'M STILL
BEATING DOWN YOUR DOOR 

1088
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:05,776
 I'D GIVE MY SOUL

1089
01:33:05,777 --> 01:33:09,113

01:33:57,329 --> 01:34:00,664
 YOU'LL READ ABOUT ME
