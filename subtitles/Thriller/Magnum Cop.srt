1
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,088
Shit, my jacket!

2
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
<i>Calice!</i>

3
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,438
It's about time!

4
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,233
<i>Toronto can bring it!
We'll show them how...</i>

5
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,570
That's a good one!

6
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,979
Good news! No overtime tonight!

7
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,691
I found you one with no GPS
and no alarm system.

8
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:57,070
Anyone need a phone cable,
some Kleenex or a teddy bear?

9
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,488
I'll take the cable.

10
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,490
Give Steve the teddy
and the Kleenex.

11
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,117
He just got dumped!

12
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,989
I'm undercover!
What are you doing here?

13
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,004
I know.

14
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,511
What are you doing here, on my turf?

15
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,996
The big boss isn't here.
None of the key players are!

16
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,922
What are you doing?

17
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,389
It's not enough. It won't work.

18
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,307
These guys don't trust anyone!

19
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,852
I think so.

20
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,232
Put your guns on the ground,
or he's dead! Now!

21
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,568
Guns on the ground!

22
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,282
You, get over there!
I don't want anyone behind me!

23
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,160
Nobody behind me! Got it?

24
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,997
Lower your guns!
Get that fucking gun down!

25
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,210
Away from the truck!
I said no one behind me!

26
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,423
I want to see hands!

27
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,925
You drive!

28
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,064
Fuck de shit de <i>calice
</i>de fuckin' <i>tabarnak!</i>

29
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,899
Your French isn't rusty at all!

30
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,946
Who tipped you off?

31
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,912
DiPietro and Dubois never go there.

32
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,374
All they do there is deactivate
the cars' GPS and alarm systems

33
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
before sending them
to the main garage.

34
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,843
No, there's something bigger
going on!

35
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm sure of it.
I've been on them for a year.

36
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,474
We can go at them harder,
but I have to go back in.

37
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,952
I'm not working for you,
I'm working with you.

38
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,477
It'll still work.

39
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,024
OK, we'll say that you disarmed me,
we fought,

40
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,235
you lost control of the vehicle
and I got away.

41
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,988
It has to look real, though,

42
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,949
as if the airbag went off
in your face.

43
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,212
That's good!

44
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,507
That'll work!

45
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
You haven't changed at all.

46
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
Come on, don't be scared!

47
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,991
This isn't my first rodeo!

48
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,664
What have you done?

49
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,381
My jacket!
Ow! You freaking maniac!

50
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,969
You really have changed!

51
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,063
My love, put it down, please!

52
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,231
Be good to not get shot
twice in one night!

53
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,067
What are you doing here?

54
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:41,951
Oops!

55
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,120
Sorry, Mrs. Bouchard.

56
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:44,871
Dad!

57
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,663
- Dad!
- Hello!

58
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,052
I'm taking you to the hospital!

59
00:11:59,094 --> 00:11:59,803
No!

60
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,222
- Get me the first-aid kit!
- No!

61
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,475
They have to think I spent
the night outside, in hiding!

62
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,559
You want to help?

63
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,895
Get me three coffees
and a stack of napkins!

64
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,856
- You, Louis-Philippe!
- Louis-Martin.

65
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,024
It's OK.

66
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,111
Mr. Bouchard didn't mean it.
He's hurt and under pressure.

67
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,697
You, give me your hoodie
and get me some speed.

68
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,031
You have half an hour.

69
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,991
Whoa, Mr. Bouchard,

70
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,121
I don't know who you think I am,
but I have no idea where to find...

71
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,505
Oh, yeah!

72
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,135
OK, I might know a guy

73
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,389
who knows a guy
who I know...

74
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,862
What are you doing?

75
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,613
Coffee! Napkins!

76
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,073
I'm on it!

77
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,123
I know what I'm doing.

78
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,337
Litter needs cleaning.

79
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,824
<i>Last night,
during a police raid</i>

80
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,578
of a known Italian crime boss's
garage of stolen cars,

81
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,997
a police officer was taken hostage

82
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,875
by one of the scumbags
that he was trying to arrest.

83
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,043
<i>He's with us this morning.</i>

84
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,920
<i>Perhaps he has
something to say this morning.</i>

85
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,506
<i>Mr. Ward, Poirier, Claude.</i>

86
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,509
How did a low-level scumbag

87
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,179
manage to kidnap a highly trained
officer like yourself?

88
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,102
When we entered the garage,

89
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:17,524
we were surprised
by the push back we encountered.

90
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,068
Many of them were armed.

91
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,820
Didn't they teach you
how to deal with that

92
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,655
at the Ontarian Nicolet,

93
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,616
that sometimes criminals might be armed?

94
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,456
I'm sorry, but I don't know...
Who's Nicolet?

95
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,421
<i>Do you want me
to "conti-news" in English?</i>

96
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,755
No, that's all right!

97
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:45,093
But could you please speak
a little more slowly?

98
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,014
Is this my stag party?

99
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,649
<i>Calice!</i>

100
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,944
Can you tell your monkey here

101
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,739
that he only needs to hit me
if I won't talk?

102
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,866
He doesn't seem to understand
the rules!

103
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,293
When we got busted last night,
things got crazy.

104
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,213
I managed to disarm one of them
and kidnapped him.

105
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>He made me drive to the Old Port.</i>

106
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,762
I was afraid he was going to kill me
and leave me there.

107
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,430
I braked suddenly,

108
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,640
and he hit the back of the seat.

109
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,560
I dropped the gun.
Punched him in the head.

110
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,146
He lost control of the truck,
and I jumped.

111
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,814
When I got out of the vehicle,

112
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,691
he was running,
so I shot at him.

113
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:46,738
Luckily, he only winged me.
So, I kept on running.

114
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,657
You don't want to know
what my night was like!

115
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,711
I didn't want to take a chance by
going somewhere and getting pinched,

116
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,963
so I spent the night outside.

117
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,342
I stole a hoodie off a bum,

118
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,262
pounded a few cups of coffee,
`cause I knew it'd be a long night.

119
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,807
I made myself a nice Band-Aid
with some napkins.

120
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,476
All I could find for the pain
was some ecstasy.

121
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,604
<i>You're a hero!</i>

122
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,107
When I first saw you,

123
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,943
<i>I thought,
"Here's just another Anglo,"</i>

124
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,153
but you're much more than that.

125
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,656
Thank you.

126
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,284
This is the composite sketch
of the scumbag.

127
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:38,665
If you see him, call my voicemail
and leave it a message.

128
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,958
10-4!

129
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,587
You little prick!

130
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,215
Looks real, Boss.

131
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,935
Doc, go easy
when you pull the bandage off.

132
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,787
What's he doing with that?

133
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,847
What's he doing?

134
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,522
Loaded with caffeine.
Amphetamines, too.

135
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,986
He needs stitches.

136
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,497
Thanks, Michel.

137
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,001
Call me Michel one more time,
and I'll rip your head off.

138
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:52,716
Michel, I'll have a scotch
with just one ice cube, please.

139
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,611
Thanks, you won't regret it.

140
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,833
Where's that scotch, Michel?

141
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,918
<i>It's not the Ritz,
but your neighbours are cute!</i>

142
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,547
After last night,
we're changing things up.

143
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,093
- What do you mean?
- Deliver right to the main garage.

144
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,845
We need 25 cars in 5 days.

145
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,557
25 in 5? We just lost half our team!

146
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,893
I've got new guys starting tonight.

147
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,978
The deadline is new.
What's the deal?

148
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,106
It's none of your goddamn business!

149
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,109
- You're early!
- I'm doing the day shift.

150
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,446
I thought no guys
were allowed upstairs!

151
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,240
He's your roommate for the week.

152
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,828
You can put him in my room
if he's afraid to sleep alone.

153
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,371
I don't bite.

154
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,874
And I like bad boys!

155
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,379
Your rockstar suite.

156
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,843
Are you the one I call
for room service?

157
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,386
Don't touch my girls.

158
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,930
You owe me a pick-up truck.
I want it by 3:00.

159
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,390
Are you fucking kidding me?

160
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,679
There's no time for your jokes.

161
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,881
It's OK.

162
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:05,385
You didn't have to go that far,
but it worked. They believed me.

163
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,636
I was scared shitless.

164
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,055
I thought they were
going to kill me!

165
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,434
And thanks for the composite sketch!

166
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,811
It was so good, I had to...

167
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,070
Federal gets quite the budget!

168
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,949
We'd be two of us in a garden shed
with an iPhone 4.

169
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,916
He's been working
for the Caprese family forever.

170
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,002
But I was recruited by Mike Dubois.

171
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,837
It's only been three months

172
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,132
since DiPietro showed up
and started running things.

173
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,606
That's why he wants a side business.

174
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,531
I tried explaining it to you,
but then you started shooting at me.

175
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,534
They've been talking about
a client for a while.

176
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:16,039
I don't know what or who it is,
but I know it's big.

177
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:21,044
The only change is the deadline:
they want 25 cars in 5 days.

178
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,547
And we're not going
to the transit warehouse anymore.

179
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,466
We go straight to the main garage.

180
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,009
Here's the address.

181
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,989
I know, but how--

182
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,245
And you'll hear me when I talk?

183
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,922
That was some reunion!

184
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,384
What are the odds that you'd raid
the spot I was working undercover?

185
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,061
And you? How's the family?

186
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,446
And Jonathan?

187
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,327
You want me to find him?

188
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,800
Kids aren't easy.

189
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:55,388
Gabrielle is living
in my old apartment upstairs.

190
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,142
It would be,
if it weren't for Cousin Itt.

191
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,228
- Cousin Itt?
- Her boyfriend.

192
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,982
It's like all he does is grow hair.

193
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,155
It's hard to tell
if he's speaking or burping.

194
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,741
Gabrielle's good.
She applied to Nicolet.

195
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:19,996
All right, I have to go!

196
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,166
I only have a couple hours
to find a pick-up truck.

197
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,129
So you'll be in my head 24/7?

198
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,472
The Ontarian grew a sense of humour!

199
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,016
You've changed, man!
I'm worried about you!

200
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,063
You're full of shit!
That's not Price's truck!

201
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,857
You don't believe me?
Check out what was inside!

202
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:51,778
His new mask!

203
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,615
Check it out!
It's awesome!

204
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,707
Price is a man of few words.
Now he'll be speechless for months!

205
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,877
Listen to this!
You'll die laughing!

206
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,879
The whole building
heard your story already.

207
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,589
And you'll tell it
40 more times anyway!

208
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,259
You're a ray of sunshine!

209
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,386
You should do ads for orange juice!

210
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,974
You have to bring his mask back!
He'll be off his game without it!

211
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,604
You want me to go up to him
after practice and say:

212
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,314
"Excuse me, Mr. Price.

213
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,984
"I stole your truck,
and this was inside.

214
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:35,363
"I know goalies are as superstitious
as bingo ladies,

215
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,867
"so I brought it back so you don't
end up puking everywhere."

216
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,911
- Put it in the mail.
- I'll bring it to him.

217
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,499
- You think I'd give it to you?
- Sure!

218
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,753
In two weeks, I'll find it
at the flea market!

219
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,088
He once sold
his sister's washer and dryer...

220
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,842
for three mags!

221
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,386
What are you gonna do
with three mags?

222
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,224
The eyes aren't right.

223
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,064
That's good!

224
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,361
I'm sure they were the big clients
I was telling you about.

225
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,489
They were so young, though!
The oldest might've been 25.

226
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,789
Because there's a demand!
There's a market for everything.

227
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,505
Then, I'm surprised there's no
high-school-diploma pushers in Quebec!

228
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,009
Come on, goddammit!

229
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:41,221
You think you're so cool
with your shitty firewall!

230
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,723
If I shove this up your ass,
what will you do?

231
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:48,186
That's MC, our computer whiz.

232
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,271
MC, David.

233
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,358
Some cowboy move,
stealing Price's truck,

234
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,567
but I like your style.

235
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,739
You and me are going to make
a fucking dangerous team!

236
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,574
- A team?
- That's right!

237
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,327
I'm your eyes, your ears,
your hands, your everything!

238
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,122
But what I'm trying to do -

239
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,624
what I will do, goddammit -

240
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,544
is hack into the system
at the Sopranos' garage.

241
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,380
I can see in that look
you're wondering how, right?

242
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,382
Ho no. That's not
what I'm wondering.

243
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,718
Who has poles and wires everywhere?

244
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,678
Who?

245
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,346
Bell and Hydro-QuÃ©bec.

246
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,225
If I hack into their system
and bypass it...

247
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,110
I've got cameras!

248
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,114
Who's the boss? Who's the genius?

249
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,700
Take that, Steve Jobs!

250
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,788
I'll give you my Macintosh!

251
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,666
Take that!

252
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,253
Ho yeah, Bill Gates?
You thought you knew everything?

253
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:04,637
All right!
As of now, we're a team!

254
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,807
I need help with the computers.
Their security is tight.

255
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,934
I don't know anything
about computers.

256
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:14,481
It's easy. Just take pictures
of their system.

257
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,567
Computers, wiring,
external hard drives, modems...

258
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,444
Whatever you can. Name it.

259
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:23,740
Sure. Hello, Minnie Mouse?
I'm undercover, you know.

260
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,576
You think I can walk around
snapping pictures with my phone?

261
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,661
He's cute. You're cute.

262
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,926
I need your help.

263
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,513
Can you get this back
to Carey Price?

264
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,682
If they start losing because of it,

265
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,851
the city will go nuts,
and people will lose their jobs!

266
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,231
Sorry, my mistake.

267
00:30:56,272 --> 00:31:00,193
Leafs fan.
I can't trust you with this!

268
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,070
Is there anyone from Montreal here?

269
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,614
Anyone?

270
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,634
I can't find the words.

271
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,450
To keep you motivated, Sylvio
has doubled everybody's fee.

272
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,202
If you think you're being followed,
don't come here.

273
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,204
Ditch the car
and call me at the bar.

274
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,498
Don't call my cell.
Is that clear?

275
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,958
What if we're arrested?

276
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,758
That's DiPietro.

277
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,086
What happens
when you're not a nice guy?

278
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:52,907
Is this a bad time?

279
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:57,537
<i>No, I just wanted to ask Mike</i>

280
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,289
if he had any special requests.

281
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,832
Yeah, I'll print them up.

282
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:07,964
He's moving too much.

283
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,675
I can't get a decent frame.

284
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:24,814
<i>OK, David, I don't
want to be a bugger, but go...</i>

285
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,610
Sure.

286
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,406
It's the pain. It's like
an electric shock sometimes.

287
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:37,035
Give the Miatas to the new guys.
I want the high-paying stuff.

288
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,788
Just grab the paper
and get to it!

289
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:43,500
<i>OK, David, just get me a shot
from behind the computer.</i>

290
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,878
<i>No! What is he doing?
I don't wanna see that guy's face.</i>

291
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,963
- Is there a problem?
<i>- Fuck that guy!</i>

292
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,090
A big problem.

293
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:52,425
<i>You can do it! Come on, David!</i>

294
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,845
<i>Perfect, OK!</i>

295
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,598
That's the good stuff!
Get closer! Closer!

296
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,016
What are you doing?

297
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,518
Yes! We got it!

298
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,104
Tabarnak! <i>It took you long, bud!</i>

299
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,146
Michel...

300
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,318
Do I need to make a spare key
every time I bring you a car?

301
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,780
Thanks, Boss. Thanks, Michel.

302
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:20,787
Can you ask your over-excited poodle
to stop barking while I'm working?

303
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:30,630
It's weird. Mike gave me
the same list as last week.

304
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,969
No way. I have to get
at least one car tonight.

305
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,888
<i>Meet me in an hour
at Ste-Catherine and Crescent.</i>

306
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:00,994
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

307
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,306
Good evening!

308
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,225
Welcome to... 5!

309
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,436
Have a good night!

310
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,033
Thanks.

311
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,303
Let's do it again tomorrow!

312
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,440
What's up with that look?
Are you my barback tonight?

313
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,067
I have a little side gig going
with the symphony.

314
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,152
You don't like it?

315
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:01,948
- I'll have a Jack and Coke.
- You sure you don't want a martini?

316
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,891
Martin, can you hear me?

317
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:28,933
<i>Wake up!</i>

318
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,980
The three clients are at the bar.

319
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,982
It's too risky for me.

320
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,777
Do it quick!

321
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,122
That's right, I talk to my penis.

322
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:55,794
I've even given him a name:
Martin.

323
00:38:57,295 --> 00:39:00,882
I don't give a damn!
Do what you want.

324
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,469
Just don't ask me to
introduce you to mine.

325
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,682
I'll be at the bar
if you change your mind.

326
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,520
Mike wants me to take care of them.

327
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:16,773
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

328
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,149
I don't ask questions,

329
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,819
as long as they tip well
and take it easy on the groping.

330
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:26,241
Gina? Jen? Can I have another?
This one's empty.

331
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,536
A double. And three more
for my friends over there.

332
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:30,787
What are you doing?

333
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,086
Jen, do you have any matches?

334
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,344
Uh-oh! They're angry!

335
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:49,889
Don't worry, it's just liquid!
Dry it off with your turban!

336
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,976
- Get the hell out!
- I'll take care of it.

337
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:57,397
- Come on!
- What are you doing, man?

338
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:15,081
Go home and come back tomorrow.

339
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,793
- That way? Tomorrow?
- Good night!

340
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,052
Listen, big shot!

341
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:28,553
Is he still here?

342
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,016
You guys can't tell me what to do
in my own--

343
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,932
Do you have a light?

344
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,810
I'm going inside.

345
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,539
You sure about that?

346
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,429
- What are they doing there?
- They're American.

347
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:37,474
Yeah, and I'm Japanese.

348
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:41,519
On Saturdays, I put on my flip-flops
and make sushi at the mall.

349
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,489
They're all at the same university.

350
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,325
- What system did you hack into?
- None.

351
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,077
They're all properly enrolled.

352
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:59,412
They're even listed in
our official database

353
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,998
as humanitarian observers
and consultants.

354
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,960
- For who? Crooks Without Borders?
- That's not a real thing.

355
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,005
Thanks, Princess Leia.

356
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,094
Fuck, this is heavy!

357
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,770
What next?

358
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:26,022
Are the KGB and Scotland Yard
on their way

359
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,358
for middle management like DiPietro?

360
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,657
Great. Keep me posted.

361
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:43,289
What tip?

362
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,046
Yeah, and?

363
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:04,728
How much did you tip him?

364
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:09,774
I want my change.

365
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,910
- You're $5 short.
- No!

366
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:40,305
You should be in AA.
Or maybe in CC...

367
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,488
Here! Swap this out!

368
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:59,282
You seem to think I work for you.

369
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:03,912
I'm sorry.
Didn't I explain this to you?

370
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:06,539
Federal...

371
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,045
provincial.

372
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:17,050
That's not the best way to talk
to a separatist with anger issues!

373
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,260
Watch your mouth, young man!

374
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:23,056
This morning, my endocrinologist
told me I wasn't the right sex!

375
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,642
My testosterone level
is abnormally high:

376
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,894
women are at 2, men are at 7,

377
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,105
and I'm a fucking 9.2!

378
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:44,411
At least she's seeing
a professional.

379
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,815
Have a nice day!

380
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,027
Hello! Can I take your order?

381
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:19,320
<i>Yes, I'd like the surf and turf,</i>

382
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,781
<i>a baked potato with foie gras</i>

383
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,034
and a glass of red wine, please.

384
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:26,745
Dad! OK, anything else?

385
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,874
I needed to see your face.

386
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,795
- Are you ready for your exam?
<i>- Yes, I'm ready.</i>

387
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:37,630
Nervous, but ready.

388
00:46:37,672 --> 00:46:40,967
Let's go over the steps involved
in a civilian intervention.

389
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,510
Dad, I'm ready!

390
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,808
Approach, identification,
questioning, listening,

391
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,144
situation analysis,
conflict resolution.

392
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,355
And if you can't resolve
the conflict?

393
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:56,775
I'll do what you'd do:
make up a law or pull my gun.

394
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,527
Very funny!

395
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,446
I'm ready, Dad.

396
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,616
I know you are. If I passed it,
then you'll ace it.

397
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:06,993
Thanks.

398
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:13,083
- Let's go, moron!
- Calm down!

399
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:16,544
There are 40 different donuts!
I need a minute to choose!

400
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,922
- <i>Dad!
</i>- I don't have all day!

401
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:22,509
<i>Drive up to
the first window, please.</i>

402
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:11,141
$4.75.

403
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,856
Can you do me a favour?
Buy some ice cream for your mother.

404
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:20,108
- Honey-lavender.
- Gross.

405
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:24,571
I can't believe that even exists.
They need a bacon and ribs flavour.

406
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:40,920
Smile!

407
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,140
- You're beautiful.
<i>- You too.</i>

408
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,435
<i>But I don't miss your biker look.</i>

409
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:21,896
I don't believe you!
You love bad boys!

410
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,776
<i>How'd you do that?</i>

411
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:29,863
I have an in
with your tenant.

412
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:34,159
I knew I was right to remarry you!

413
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,577
<i>You're the perfect man:</i>

414
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:39,914
<i>you're never here, so you feel bad
and do cute things like this!</i>

415
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,292
Hang on.

416
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,797
You OK?

417
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:51,801
<i>No. This is tough.</i>

418
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,262
I know, my love.

419
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,724
<i>- But it's almost over.
</i>- It's never over.

420
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,228
Sometimes I wonder
why I do all this,

421
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,147
<i>just to catch a couple crooks.</i>

422
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,941
Then the trial will take years,

423
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:10,278
and if any evidence gets thrown out,
the whole thing goes down the drain!

424
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,364
Can you put my husband on?

425
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,908
<i>My man never talks this way.</i>

426
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:18,703
<i>- Do you know him?
</i>- No. What's he like?

427
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:21,956
<i>He's a stubborn bastard
with a bad temper,</i>

428
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:26,961
<i>but he's the bravest, most honest,
most determined man there is.</i>

429
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,006
Go on.

430
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,050
<i>He's an alpha male.</i>

431
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,135
He doesn't quit until he wins.

432
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:38,264
<i>I should know. He won me over twice!</i>

433
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:40,141
I don't deserve you!

434
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,479
I know.

435
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,816
What are you doing?

436
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,369
Stop it! You're hot
even when you're being ridiculous!

437
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,329
Really?

438
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,592
What are you doing?

439
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,224
<i>- Are you there?
</i>- Yes, I'm here, my love.

440
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,226
<i>Sorry, it was work.</i>

441
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,566
<i>That's a lie. I'm not at a motel.</i>

442
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:32,527
I know! You wouldn't be
a good undercover cop with me.

443
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:36,614
<i>OK, I'll let you go.
I want to enjoy my ice cream.</i>

444
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,662
You're so mean!

445
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,888
Watch this.

446
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:10,018
There's something strange here.

447
00:55:11,644 --> 00:55:14,064
Boss! Come here!
We've got something!

448
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:23,615
They only put their guns down after
he says something into his mic.

449
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:28,912
Check this out!

450
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:32,749
But then he mutters something else.

451
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,376
Right here.

452
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:59,025
I'm a big boy.
It's been a year, and I'm fine.

453
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,993
We just need a break,
and it'll all come together!

454
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,543
What?

455
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:23,258
At least I can teach her something
`cause she still talks to me!

456
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,181
My boss?

457
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,893
It's true. He is your boss!

458
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,520
- Shut up!
<i>- Ta yeule!</i>

459
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:42,736
Yeah?

460
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:48,199
OK. I'm on my way.

461
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,338
He has problems with authority.
Like me.

462
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,596
You wanted to talk, Boss?

463
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:12,724
- We need you to do a...
- I wasn't talking to you.

464
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:16,227
...a delivery to Maine, the Mustang.

465
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:19,147
- Hurry and you'll be back tonight.
- Give it to a kid.

466
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:22,609
If I'm in Maine, I can't steal cars,
and I can't make money.

467
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:33,787
- OK, let's go.
- Excuse me?

468
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:36,831
Michel...

469
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,418
you said "let's."

470
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:43,672
Sometimes "let's" excludes
the speaker,

471
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:46,257
but it sounded like you meant
both of us.

472
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:51,304
You can't do this to me!

473
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:55,767
You can't do this to me!
There's no way we'll agree on music.

474
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,352
I bet he listens to dance music.

475
00:57:57,394 --> 00:58:00,146
- You look like a dance-music guy.
- What?

476
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,234
<i>Hostie,</i> he does listen to dance!

477
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,626
Thanks, Boss. Thanks, Michel.

478
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:27,007
The keys?

479
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,802
Are they in the usual place?

480
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:54,117
Hey, General!
You decided to swing by?

481
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:59,622
I'm touched. I really appreciate it.

482
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:06,755
Everything's fine. Otherwise,
the little guy would be with me.

483
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:11,885
You're so possessive!

484
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:12,445
Let's try something.

485
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:21,496
Yeah, I'm here. The rendezvous point
is an old truck stop.

486
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,294
Looks fine,
but the client isn't here.

487
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:32,048
There's police everywhere.
He won't show up right away.

488
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,512
OK, but I really have to piss.

489
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,019
Yes, Dad!

490
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,655
Yes, bitch! I've got you!

491
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:58,742
Look, Boss! We've got their
computer's camera and mic!

492
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:24,517
They're going to blow up the car
by satellite! That's brilliant!

493
01:01:28,396 --> 01:01:32,067
Yes, Dad! I lifted the seat
and washed my hands.

494
01:01:33,568 --> 01:01:35,278
Make up your mind, Dad!

495
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:45,872
What?

496
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,295
Wait! What satellite?

497
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:08,645
I can't leave the car here.
There's a ton of people around!

498
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,730
<i>Fuck, David!</i> Calice!

499
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:28,289
Cops!

500
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,256
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

501
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:35,774
The GPS
is starting a countdown!

502
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:38,568
- Turn off their computer!
- I can't!

503
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:10,243
Martin, can you hear me?

504
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,831
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

505
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:19,419
And no one--

506
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,345
Don't yell, goddammit!
I have sensitive eardrums!

507
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:52,901
Where are you from?

508
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:55,362
United Stupids of America?
Or South Moronia?

509
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:56,446
You fucking dumbass!

510
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:59,009
Yep! Damn sure!

511
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,273
Did you really think
they'd let me go

512
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:03,318
because you flashed
your little Canadian police badge?

513
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,487
You're so naÃ¯ve!

514
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:09,157
You haven't become
a Jehovah's Witness, have you?

515
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:12,577
I was driving a car that exploded

516
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:15,872
in the country with the most
terrorist threats in the world!

517
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:19,042
Now, instead of just me
being stuck here, we both are!

518
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,919
Good job!

519
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:26,716
Ladies and gentlemen,
my partner, Martin Ward!

520
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:46,236
You know.
Don't rub it in.

521
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:03,253
Definitely!

522
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:07,799
It's brilliant: you disseminate
stolen cars all over the States

523
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:09,676
and simultaneously blow them up!

524
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:16,850
What do we do if we get out?

525
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:42,542
Is it that hard for you
to be alone in a room with me?

526
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:48,923
What is it?

527
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,141
What is it?

528
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:01,728
This isn't the first time.
What's going on?

529
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:14,199
I'm sick, David.

530
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,210
I have Lou Gehrig's disease.

531
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:33,343
Who's Lou Gehrig?

532
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:37,639
He was a baseball player.
Had one of the first known cases.

533
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:43,895
I don't know baseball.

534
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,190
Is it like Parkinson's?

535
01:16:49,442 --> 01:16:51,778
It's a degenerative disease.

536
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:14,884
It's like Russian roulette.

537
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,816
That could take years.

538
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:42,746
There must be medication.

539
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:21,446
What an asshole!

540
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,686
The big boss pulled the plug, Boss.

541
01:20:54,604 --> 01:20:56,564
My boss is you, Boss. Not your boss.

542
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:59,109
Don't ask me.

543
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,945
There's no signal.
I don't understand.

544
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,613
What the fuck?

545
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:06,282
- Are they still in the garage?
- No.

546
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:10,036
Yes, but there's no signal.

547
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:12,288
OK. The consulate.

548
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,238
Yes, the bartender kept me in touch.
There is hardly anyone left.

549
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:57,292
We're closed!
Don't you have a watch?

550
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:08,720
Remember me?

551
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:15,894
I don't know this Lou Gehrig, but
he must've been a hell of a player!

552
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,396
Sorry, too soon?

553
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:24,861
Fuck!

554
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:34,579
OK, everybody out!

555
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,416
Michel!

556
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,211
Mikey!

557
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,547
I know you're here, Mikey!

558
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,675
OK, easy! Easy there!

559
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:56,685
Don't make me shoot. Let her go.
She didn't know I was a cop!

560
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,524
Shut up! I'm getting out of here,
or I slit her throat. Got it?

561
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:08,363
Let her go, and we'll put
our guns down so we can talk.

562
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,699
What kind of idiot
do you think I am?

563
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:12,617
Don't move!

564
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,540
Shut up! I'll bleed her dry,
goddammit!

565
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:21,918
Calm down! Look!

566
01:23:23,503 --> 01:23:25,463
I'm putting down my gun.

567
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:28,550
Let him go. He'll kill her.

568
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:32,303
- Put your gun down!
- Drop it!

569
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,222
Tell him to drop it!

570
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:59,914
You fucking psychopath!

571
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:06,421
Abusive motherfucking pimp!

572
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:14,387
You won't be grabbing
anyone's ass anymore!

573
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:26,858
OK, two more?
What do you think, Martin?

574
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:36,117
OK, it's over.

575
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,262
Are you all right?

576
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,309
As soon as we're gone, call 911.

577
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:07,273
- Aren't you the police?
- Yes, but no.

578
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:12,112
- You understand?
- No, but yes.

579
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:15,115
As soon as we leave, call 911.

580
01:25:15,156 --> 01:25:18,159
Tell them someone's been
seriously injured. Then get out.

581
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:20,578
Make sure you're gone
before they get here.

582
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:22,163
You have a boyfriend?

583
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:26,334
Good. Go to his place
and stay there until I call you.

584
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:27,794
I'll call you when this is all over.

585
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,338
Then you can teach me
some of those moves.

586
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:36,302
Thanks, Jen.

587
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:46,062
You can't do this, motherfuckers!

588
01:25:59,325 --> 01:25:59,951
What?

589
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,748
Cool, that's a good sign!
I knew you'd work it out!

590
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:06,916
You assholes--

591
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:21,139
You can shove your deals
up your ass!

592
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,643
I know you, Mike.

593
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,439
You're a liar, a thief and a cheat.

594
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:31,066
All about cash and chicks.

595
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:33,735
But you're no killer.

596
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,531
You think I'm scared of the police?

597
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,618
You gonna hit me with a phone book
if I don't talk?

598
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:52,671
Look around, you moron.
Does this look like a police station?

599
01:26:53,171 --> 01:26:55,548
You think we brought you here
to finger paint

600
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,134
and take pictures of your ugly face?

601
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:02,055
I'll rearrange your face!

602
01:27:05,266 --> 01:27:07,060
My wife!

603
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,441
Hide him! Hide him!

604
01:27:19,406 --> 01:27:22,033
- David?
- Hello!

605
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:24,285
Did I wake you?

606
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:27,664
It doesn't matter.

607
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:28,832
What are you doing?

608
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:32,460
Working.

609
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:38,008
You have blood on your hand.

610
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:41,886
Oh, yeah! Would you look at that!

611
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:50,020
- Is someone with you?
- No.

612
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:52,772
Oh, him? That's just Martin.

613
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:55,066
Martin! Well, I--

614
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:58,611
My love, you can't go in the garage.

615
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:03,908
You'd better not be putting us
in danger with your bullshit.

616
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:05,994
No way!

617
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,830
Trust me!

618
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,710
We'll talk about this later.

619
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:17,672
Thank you, my love! I love you!

620
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:32,062
I'm in big trouble.

621
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,086
Come on, Michel!

622
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:02,217
Don't swallow this!
It's bad for your health!

623
01:29:02,258 --> 01:29:06,262
I know where you live!
I'll slit your wife's throat!

624
01:29:11,726 --> 01:29:15,689
Or what? You think I'm scared of
a few punches in the face?

625
01:29:55,478 --> 01:29:58,648
OK, OK, OK!
But it's too late!

626
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,275
There are already 20 cars
across the border.

627
01:30:00,316 --> 01:30:02,861
The last batch leaves this morning.

628
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:05,739
They're all rigged to explode
on the same day!

629
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:08,408
They're mobile bombs! That's it!

630
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,868
Who's delivering the cars?

631
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:13,747
A bunch of greedy kids.
But they won't be back.

632
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:18,251
They don't know the cars are rigged.
They're going to explode with them.

633
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:20,378
There's no connection between them.

634
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,715
By the time the FBI figures it out,
everyone will be gone.

635
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:27,969
I don't know.
I swear I don't know!

636
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,764
All we did was get the cars
and handle delivery.

637
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:33,475
I don't even know
when they're set to go off!

638
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:38,438
All I know is the last batch
is leaving this morning at 5:00!

639
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,814
From where?

640
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:45,653
- From where?
- A vacant lot in the east end!

641
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:48,531
That's all I know, I swear!

642
01:31:07,884 --> 01:31:12,889
Impressive. Especially using
a drill with no battery.

643
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:29,572
Don't call me Michel!

644
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:39,833
You sure you're OK with this?

645
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:44,379
It might not go that far.

646
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:01,396
If plan A doesn't work,
we go right to plan B. Got it?

647
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:03,690
Sounds to me like
you have two plan Cs!

648
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:08,194
Well, well! The strip-club owner
is suddenly a mastermind!

649
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:11,531
Get over your fear of harmless tools

650
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:14,951
and then apply for a job
with the RCMP or the SQ!

651
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,501
But if you're shaking like that...

652
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:40,810
Well, Michel,
our lives are connected.

653
01:32:41,978 --> 01:32:43,938
If something happens,
we're both dead.

654
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:46,358
You guys are fucking nuts.

655
01:32:47,275 --> 01:32:51,154
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me. Thank you.

656
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:53,907
Let's go.

657
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:19,182
<i>Martin, are you ready?</i>

658
01:33:43,623 --> 01:33:46,001
I found your poodle.
Is there a reward?

659
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,050
What a shitty plan!

660
01:33:54,092 --> 01:33:55,260
<i>The cars can't go.</i>

661
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,075
Martin, I've got DiPietro!

662
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:05,038
Martin, where are you?
Can you hear me?

663
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,918
I need help with the kids!

664
01:35:11,711 --> 01:35:14,714
This will hurt, but you need to
put direct pressure on it.

665
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:23,765
Martin, they can see us!
It's going to blow!

666
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:59,592
TABARNAK!

667
01:36:24,993 --> 01:36:26,494
What the fuck?

668
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:44,179
What?

669
01:37:01,946 --> 01:37:03,656
Get a hold of yourself!

670
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:09,204
Martin, I understand,
but this isn't the time!

671
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:24,052
He's not dead!
There weren't any other explosions!

672
01:37:24,094 --> 01:37:26,137
But I need you now!

673
01:37:26,179 --> 01:37:27,847
Jonathan needs you!

674
01:37:34,562 --> 01:37:36,064
We can't go after your son.

675
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:46,908
Me too! But we won't find your son
before he crosses the border.

676
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:51,579
The only way to save your son
is to stop the cars from exploding.

677
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,895
What part of "emergency"
don't you understand?

678
01:40:35,577 --> 01:40:38,413
Are they going to
take us seriously now?

679
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:43,293
I can't take
their shitty attitude anymore!

680
01:40:43,752 --> 01:40:46,546
You're lucky my friend's son
is caught up in this,

681
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:50,216
otherwise I'd be at home
with my feet up, drinking a beer

682
01:40:50,258 --> 01:40:54,304
and watching the cars blow up live
on fucking CNN!

683
01:40:54,346 --> 01:40:58,641
I can't handle them acting
like they're king of the world,

684
01:40:58,683 --> 01:41:01,603
as if the Garden of Eden itself
was in sunny California!

685
01:41:27,295 --> 01:41:31,341
Sometimes you have to be direct
in order to get things moving.

686
01:42:28,356 --> 01:42:31,860
<i>Martin, David, can you hear me?
I picked up the signal!</i>

687
01:42:38,616 --> 01:42:41,619
I've got their computer's signal!
They reconnected!

688
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:47,292
I can't hack in,
but the tracker is up.

689
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:49,252
That's impossible, MC.

690
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,633
I have the tracker! It's moving!

691
01:42:56,926 --> 01:43:00,013
<i>It's on the move, but it must be
hooked up to a generator.</i>

692
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:07,687
And don't say a damn word
until I call you back.

693
01:44:39,904 --> 01:44:42,449
Oh yeah? You want to meet
a real hard head?

694
01:44:47,203 --> 01:44:48,705
- You OK?
- Oh yeah!

695
01:45:17,317 --> 01:45:18,443
What?

696
01:45:44,427 --> 01:45:47,305
Without the gun,
he wouldn't have given us the car.

697
01:45:47,347 --> 01:45:48,348
Well, maybe.

698
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:50,100
<i>Yes, Boss!</i>

699
01:45:58,233 --> 01:45:59,651
<i>You should be close.</i>

700
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:01,945
<i>He just stopped.</i>

701
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:07,450
<i>Yes, there it goes!</i>

702
01:46:46,906 --> 01:46:48,742
There's plenty of room!

703
01:46:52,495 --> 01:46:54,205
It's tight, but we'll make it.

704
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:24,110
I knew we'd make it!

705
01:47:40,502 --> 01:47:41,586
Are you crazy?

706
01:48:20,166 --> 01:48:21,167
<i>I'm listening.</i>

707
01:48:22,544 --> 01:48:26,423
No, but I found the GPS coordinates
of some of the cars.

708
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:31,052
I'm on it, Boss!

709
01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:35,890
There's no time
to find the cars and disarm them!

710
01:48:37,684 --> 01:48:40,145
We have to get the truck
out of signal range.

711
01:48:45,191 --> 01:48:49,320
Submerge it! That's good!
But how the fuck do we do that?

712
01:48:51,406 --> 01:48:55,326
I know!
We'll call the fire department...

713
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:08,423
Open up!

714
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:14,346
I love you, my friend.

715
01:49:14,387 --> 01:49:16,097
Man, those pills are strong!

716
01:49:17,432 --> 01:49:19,184
Martin, don't do this to me!

717
01:49:33,948 --> 01:49:35,450
Oh, sorry!

718
01:49:36,785 --> 01:49:38,995
Police! I need your bike.

719
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:41,873
- Fuck you, dude!
- I'm a cop!

720
01:49:41,915 --> 01:49:43,750
I don't give a shit!

721
01:49:50,423 --> 01:49:55,428
You asshole! This is going
on YouTube, pig!

722
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:58,390
- What's your badge number?
- 728!

723
01:50:34,426 --> 01:50:35,885
What's your problem?

724
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:51,860
You wanna die?
You'll have to kill me!

725
01:50:53,611 --> 01:50:55,071
No way! You're my partner!

726
01:50:55,113 --> 01:50:58,950
You want to drive into the river?
Fine! Let's drive into the river!

727
01:51:34,986 --> 01:51:37,572
Your French is coming along great!

728
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,616
Immersion really works!

729
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,748
I'm sure the computer system
is down now!

730
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,132
NEW YORK MOSQUE

731
01:52:11,189 --> 01:52:12,649
BOSTON MOSQUE

732
01:52:12,691 --> 01:52:15,735
I'll meet you there.
We'll split the plane ticket.

733
01:53:06,077 --> 01:53:08,288
Police! Disperse!

734
01:53:08,329 --> 01:53:11,499
"Disperse?"
Where do you think you are?

735
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:13,793
Police! Get the fuck out of the way!

736
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:17,130
No, no! Fuck!

737
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,232
Don't touch that!

738
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:14,312
I don't know how!

739
01:54:15,772 --> 01:54:19,234
"Come back straight"?
This isn't a freaking scooter!

740
01:54:19,943 --> 01:54:20,944
I know!

741
01:54:22,195 --> 01:54:24,531
Don't touch it!
One thing at a time!

742
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:27,701
It's not that one! You've tried it
four times already!

743
01:54:51,266 --> 01:54:52,976
You think it worked?

744
01:54:56,271 --> 01:54:57,897
How can we find out?

745
01:58:08,004 --> 01:58:11,925
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

746
01:58:52,882 --> 01:58:54,884
I wonder which one I am.

747
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:11,461
Thank you for what you did
for our country.

748
02:00:13,046 --> 02:00:16,007
Mister President,
it was an honour "tabarnak".

749
02:00:20,845 --> 02:00:22,389
He spoke to me in French!

750
02:00:23,223 --> 02:00:25,892
I bet he didn't even do that
for CÃ©line!
