1
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,167
Did you get something?

2
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,957
They didn't have time to remove the chip.

3
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,756
Maybe

4
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,246
the blueprints are still in here somewhere.

5
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,137
What?

6
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:52,136
Maybe they had inside help.

7
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,877
Inside help?

8
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,807
Yes.

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,417
There wasn't enough time for them to

10
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,317
remove the chip.

11
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,817
I think they handed them over to someone

12
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,636
in the blind spot somewhere.

13
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,147
Father, Jiwan didn't do it.

14
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:14,187
I'm sure you think the same thing.

15
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:19,036
But I'm saying I did my part this time.

16
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,856
You're too loud I can't eat.

17
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,597
Mom, don't you think I earned some points?

18
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:30,746
That's all you think of these days, right?

19
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:33,027
You think your father doesn't know that?

20
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,826
He knows, but he's letting it pass.

21
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:37,117
Isn't that a good sign?

22
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,426
You think so?

23
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,826
But you need to learn that your father is

24
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,917
the scariest when he is not doing anything.

25
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:48,677
What scares me more are things you say.

26
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,766
Mr. Im,

27
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:59,796
Jiwan found out about the security chip.

28
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:01,887
Take care of it.

29
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,266
Okay.

30
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:18,706
Surprise!

31
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:21,637
Honey, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,796
I didn't know until Yeongju called me

33
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:25,956
that it's your birthday.

34
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,007
She was really mad.

35
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,826
She really cares about your birthday.

36
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:32,986
Why did you come alone? Where's Yeongju?

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,137
I thought you were coming home together.

38
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,406
Hello.

39
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,776
You wanted me gone, so why did you call?

40
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:53,676
What was that?

41
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,986
You said I was a fraud.

42
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,097
I'm very sorry about earlier.

43
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,217
Well...

44
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,497
When do you need the synopses?

45
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:04,137
Forget it. Writers are a dime a dozen.

46
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,687
I'm very sorry.

47
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,677
I have lots of ideas.

48
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,546
I'll write and work hard at it, too.

49
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,227
Should I send you one tomorrow?

50
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:13,296
Will you offer me a contract then?

51
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:18,896
I'll think about it after I read it.

52
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:20,216
Thank you.

53
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,407
Thank you so much.

54
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:23,856
Thank you.

55
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,196
Yeongju.

56
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,456
Did you eat?

57
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:52,096
I'm not hungry.

58
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:01,387
Mom, did you know about dad?

59
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,546
Yeongju.

60
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:15,697
You knew, and you've been doing that?

61
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:20,617
Yes, I made your dad stay there.

62
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:23,146
I knew it, but I couldn't tell him to quit.

63
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,307
No, I didn't.

64
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,757
Right.

65
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:30,156
I knew it.

66
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,276
I thought about it the whole time coming home.

67
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,976
Why did dad do it? Why did he have to do it?

68
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,326
Yes, I made a bad investment, so I've

69
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:40,127
I've been paying 1000s in interest per month.

70
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:41,917
So how could I tell him to quit?

71
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,826
We have no money for next month.

72
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:47,187
I had a hard time having the job I hate.

73
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,477
But dad's been hanging on

74
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,756
at a place where everyone wants him gone.

75
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,627
Imagine how he must have felt.

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,057
Stop it!

77
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,867
Knowing that,

78
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,927
how could you make him stay in that hell?

79
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,127
Meanwhile, you were having fun, taking yoga!

80
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,437
You're horrible!

81
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:08,836
How dare you!

82
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,147
How dare you talk to your mother like that!

83
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:16,286
How can you be that vicious to your mom!

84
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,346
You,

85
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,976
apologize to your mom.

86
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,016
Can't you hear me?

87
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,466
Apologize right now!

88
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,986
Honey, stop it.

89
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:29,207
Please don't do this.

90
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,727
You come back here!

91
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,846
This is what we get for spoiling you!

92
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:38,726
Honey, stop.

93
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,617
Why did you just listen to that, Minja?

94
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:44,157
You did all you can.

95
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:45,866
What is this?

96
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,497
You didn't do anything wrong.

97
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,406
Mom, what are you doing?

98
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:04,107
Oh?

99
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,207
Isn't that the purse Sugyeong gave you?

100
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,927
You're going somewhere?

101
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,757
Go away. Don't even think about it.

102
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,896
It's not like it'll wear out after one use.

103
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,716
Haengsuk.

104
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:24,377
How much do you think I can get for it?

105
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,716
Mom,

106
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,976
Seonhui doesn't give you any money?

107
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,016
Just ask her for some.

108
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,927
Why do you tiptoe around her? I'm upset.

109
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,497
It's because of you.

110
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,247
If it weren't for you, I'd have no trouble.

111
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,177
If the blueprints are in the building,

112
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,047
we still have hope.

113
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,746
Right.

114
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,697
Everything's going to be alright.

115
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,526
I asked Security to track the chip,

116
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,806
but he didn't get a signal in the building.

117
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,786
Then...

118
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,507
Why aren't things working out for us?

119
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,007
Those who took the blueprints

120
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,857
knew about the security chip.

121
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:40,877
How many employees would know that?

122
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,966
I'm not sure.

123
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,507
I didn't even think of it until you told me.

124
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:49,897
If they had inside help, it must have been

125
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,146
someone who knew about that.

126
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,007
Okay. I'll get the list of people.

127
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,137
Thanks, Hyeondo.

128
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,646
Now you're grateful?

129
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:07,336
It's great to have the owner's son as a friend.

130
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,597
But Ms. Seo is a bit...

131
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,416
We'll talk about it later.

132
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,486
Grandma, I can't stay in here anymore.

133
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:39,697
Hey,

134
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:42,147
it feels good in here.

135
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,787
Sweating will make your skin soft.

136
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,037
Stay a little longer.

137
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,567
I'll die of suffocation first, grandma.

138
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,317
Did you think

139
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,736
having soft skin was easy?

140
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,616
Mother, I should go to the hotter room.

141
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,786
I'm not sweating very much.

142
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,317
Hotter room?

143
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,746
Mom, I'll stay here.

144
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:05,026
Yes, the hotter one's a bit too much for me.

145
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,076
Grandma.

146
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,447
What is it?

147
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:35,267
What do you think about mom seeing someone?

148
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:39,136
Is she seeing someone?

149
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:42,576
No, she's not.

150
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:47,716
She's still young, and we're all grown up,

151
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,057
so I thought she might be lonely.

152
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,856
Don't even start.

153
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:55,366
I told her over and over again

154
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,996
not to worry about us and get married

155
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,676
if she met anyone nice.

156
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,927
But whenever I told her that, she would say

157
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,897
she couldn't do that to you two.

158
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,737
Oh, I'm sick and tired of that issue now.

159
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,917
What is it?

160
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,017
You want your mom to get married?

161
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:19,756
To be honest, I don't want her to date anyone.

162
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,256
You don't?

163
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,616
Don't you feel the same way?

164
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,456
Right?

165
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,766
You do, right?

166
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,257
I'm all sweated out.

167
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:34,856
I'm leaving, grandma.

168
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:38,756
This right here. Five times.

169
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,306
And then we'll get out.

170
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,017
I'm dying, grandma.

171
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,506
She insisted on coming by herself,

172
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:48,956
but she still isn't here.

173
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:50,456
Who? Aunt?

174
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,706
Speaking of the devil,

175
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:54,366
there she comes.

176
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,226
- Mom. / - I'm glad you're here.

177
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:01,096
Seonhui, Eunsu, you're here, too?

178
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:02,976
Hi, Haengsuk.

179
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,776
Aunt, you want eggs? Or sweet rice drink?

180
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:07,367
No, I'll have those eggs.

181
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,626
Don't get up.

182
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,096
Grandma, your porcelain skin

183
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,156
was a result of hard work.

184
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:15,427
Yes, look at my skin.

185
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,197
I don't look my age.

186
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:19,986
It's a result of perseverance and efforts.

187
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,326
That's right.

188
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:27,336
I'm glad only Jiwan takes after Sangjun.

189
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,966
If you were also as quiet as your father,

190
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,996
I would've died of frustration.

191
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:49,047
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:54,106
When does your daughter graduate?

193
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,206
She has one semester left.

194
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:02,256
You'll have to hang on for one more semester.

195
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:07,057
You have to do it, playing the Grim Reaper,

196
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,807
and I have to hang on, not to get fired.

197
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,407
We'll have to do it for one more semester.

198
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,526
I won't live that way.

199
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:27,857
Even when I'm old,

200
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:31,036
I'm not going to live that way.

201
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,866
What am I doing right now...

202
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,677
If I do what I want to do,

203
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:46,447
my dad has to keep doing that.

204
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,626
I'm being selfish.

205
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,856
I'm very selfish.

206
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,797
Let's drink together.

207
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:06,766
And you're not selfish.

208
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:11,047
That's not being selfish.

209
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,116
That's not.

210
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:19,587
Jiwan.

211
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,397
Jiwan!

212
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,817
It's Jiwan.

213
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,006
Hello.

214
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,866
Eunsu, are you all right?

215
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:44,116
Can we have another shot glass?

216
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,656
Okay.

217
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,276
Thank you.

218
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,246
Yeongju.

219
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,987
Let's drink together...

220
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,006
No, I'm fine.

221
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,576
Is something wrong?

222
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,636
Yeongju's dad...

223
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:19,276
You know what?

224
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:26,506
I thought my dad was the greatest.

225
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,316
But...

226
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:32,257
He was a reliable husband to my mom

227
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:35,256
and a loving dad for me.

228
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,447
But...

229
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:43,996
To see him treated that way at work,

230
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,176
I felt so sad for him.

231
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,777
Let me go to the restroom.

232
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,136
Where are you going? Listen to me first.

233
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,046
Restroom.

234
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,657
You're not drinking?

235
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,826
My dad was...

236
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,956
I went to my dad's workplace.

237
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:40,147
He was on his knees there.

238
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:46,157
And I got upset and screamed.

239
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:50,336
But my dad said he was okay.

240
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:55,606
He said he was okay and consoled me.

241
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,047
Yeongju, just a second.

242
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,037
Hi, Eunsu.

243
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:02,517
Where are you?

244
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,937
You're home?

245
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,716
Eunsu went home?

246
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,326
Yes, Yeongju. You're drunk.

247
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:17,256
Let's go.

248
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,346
Go where? Let's go for another drink.

249
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,596
I'll take you home.

250
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,076
Let go. I'm going out for another drink.

251
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:24,287
Get up.

252
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,406
Are you all right?

253
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:27,737
Yeongju.

254
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:49,076
Why do I always find things out late?

255
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:55,356
I found out about dad late.

256
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:01,226
I found out about my dream late.

257
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:09,767
I found out about the nice man I have late.

258
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,616
Get up. Let's go.

259
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,977
- Get up, Yeongju. / - Let go.

260
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,807
I said let go!

261
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:32,687
You really shouldn't be

262
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,856
doing things like this for me.

263
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,677
You're drunk.

264
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,346
Let go.

265
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,456
I'll go alone.

266
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,116
Oh, my,

267
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,997
you got here early.

268
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,957
I don't think I'm late.

269
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:19,637
You went to see Seonhui?

270
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,037
Have you been tailing me?

271
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,406
Why would you scare me like that?

272
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:28,026
I feel like I should prepare for the worst.

273
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:29,307
What did you say to her?

274
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,366
What do you think?

275
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,247
Isn't it obvious?

276
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,987
I was going to tell her how bold you are.

277
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,727
I only stole one bank account, but I felt

278
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,017
uncomfortable facing Seonhui's family.

279
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,027
But you stole their entire fortune,

280
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,747
and you're not scared of seeing them.

281
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,497
They hit poverty overnight because of you,

282
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:51,227
and your don't feel guilt in your conscience?

283
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:56,096
You're talking about conscience and guilt?

284
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,156
Fine.

285
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,297
What does your conscience want?

286
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:02,487
You failed at getting transaction records,

287
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:06,157
and you haven't told Seonhui anything.

288
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:09,026
That means you want something from me.

289
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,747
I've  never asked you for much.

290
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,567
Just one thing, that's all.

291
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:23,546
This is the bond from the loan sharks.

292
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:28,777
After this, I owe you nothing.

293
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,636
He didn't set this up

294
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:55,146
with the loan shark people, did he?

295
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,756
Wait, he stole a family's fortune,

296
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:01,807
and this is all he's going to offer me?

297
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,927
Taesu's become very petty.

298
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,196
Man...

299
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:18,326
Only the management level and above

300
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,116
in Security knew about it.

301
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,057
That's over 20 people.

302
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:26,347
This man was appointed relatively recently.

303
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,427
Mr. Im Hanseok. Do you know him?

304
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,576
No, I've never seen that name before.

305
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:34,227
You're right.

306
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:37,627
It happened after he was appointed.

307
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,636
And only his contact number's missing.

308
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:41,486
I'll check with the secretary's office.

309
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,836
Hello, Mr. Choi.

310
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:47,686
This is Jang Hyeondo.

311
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,516
The executive secretary,

312
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:52,376
the one who was just appointed.

313
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,896
Can I get his personal number?

314
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,006
What?

315
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:03,187
You don't have his number?

316
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,387
Okay.

317
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,826
Isn't it simpler to hand her over

318
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:23,186
to the loan sharks than to pay her debt off?

319
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:26,747
Even to you,

320
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:30,366
she didn't look like she'd go away quietly?

321
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,506
Why don't you hand her over?

322
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,797
If I call them right now...

323
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,606
The thing about people is that

324
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:44,007
they need hope or desire to be cautious.

325
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,047
Women like Lee Jeongae become

326
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,606
unpredictable if they are pushed too far.

327
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,976
If things go wrong after I hand her over to

328
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,157
the loan sharks, she'll come after me.

329
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:01,957
There's one thing I'm worried about.

330
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:09,777
Why did she need to take out a loan?

331
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:13,636
Should I find out?

332
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,776
Yes.

333
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,716
She loved spending money, but she wasn't

334
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:22,637
reckless enough to turn to loan sharks.

335
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:49,807
Kids, mommy's here.

336
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,807
Hello.

337
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:52,846
Hi.

338
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:54,517
These are for you.

339
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:55,937
Thank you.

340
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,726
- Thank you. / - Sure.

341
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:01,906
What brings you here?

342
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:04,236
I came to see you, mom.

343
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,846
Eunha is inside.

344
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,487
Okay.

345
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,467
You said you're broke, so stop bringing snacks.

346
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,367
I might be getting some money soon.

347
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,336
This is why people should have lots of kids.

348
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:21,426
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,706
It's nothing.

350
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:25,297
You have lots of kids, so you should see.

351
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,886
One of them might take care of you.

352
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,126
Unlike other mugs, I'm trying to

353
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:34,116
make the top part of the handle round.

354
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:37,226
And I want to put a flower motif on it.

355
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,177
Using graphics.

356
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,596
Is that possible?

357
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:48,317
Ma'am!

358
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,757
Yes?

359
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:55,157
Did you remove the invitations from here?

360
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,516
No.

361
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,836
Did I put them somewhere else?

362
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:00,606
What is it?

363
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,206
Do you need an invitation to get in?

364
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,747
No,

365
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:08,616
my face is all I need. I don't need one.

366
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:11,397
Let's go.

367
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,897
Okay. Take care of it,

368
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,067
and I'll talk to you on Monday.

369
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:28,717
I can't let Kim Jiwan stay at my company.

370
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:36,287
He's working at a place like this?

371
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,757
Oh, no!

372
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,927
He's the one who stole my invitations?

373
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:45,226
Okay. Bye.

374
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:49,486
Honey, if you're done, let's go and eat.

375
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,247
Honey!

376
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,517
I want to buy this painting!

377
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:57,447
This one?

378
00:24:57,446 --> 00:25:01,616
The colors and the divided composition would

379
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:04,386
- look great in our living room... / - Whatever.

380
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,106
How much is it?

381
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:08,696
How many times must I tell you it's vulgar to

382
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:11,286
talk of price when it comes to masterpieces?

383
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,156
So you're saying

384
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:16,336
if I heard the price, I'd have a heart attack?

385
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:18,576
If you're not going to buy it, let's leave.

386
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:21,336
Thank you for letting me escape from here.

387
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,416
The food here is good. Let's come here often.

388
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:35,586
I only get invitations from nice places.

389
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,356
- He stole the invitation for here? / - What?

390
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:40,856
What did you say?

391
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:44,896
It's nothing. Keep eating, Mr. Jang Taesu.

392
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:49,147
There are no tables by the window?

393
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:50,966
What's that?

394
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,307
Isn't that Hyeondo's voice?

395
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:54,366
No, that isn't Hyeondo's voice.

396
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,007
You must be going deaf.

397
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,237
Have some more wine.

398
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:58,667
Here.

399
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:04,686
Go inside...

400
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:12,836
What are you doing?

401
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,076
I can't cut the steak.

402
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,517
Can you cut it for me?

403
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:23,836
Still, don't throw your steak at my plate.

404
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:26,067
Okay. Let's go.

405
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,346
Have lunch before you leave.

406
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:45,656
I have to leave, too, so clean up afterwards.

407
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:48,686
I'm not eating. You eat.

408
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:50,276
Fine. Just starve yourself.

409
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,317
It's your stomach, not mine.

410
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:59,016
They said it's now or never,

411
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,567
so I wanted to ask if I should review anything.

412
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,947
I was going to talk to you about Ohyeah Media.

413
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,076
I don't think that place is legit.

414
00:27:06,076 --> 00:27:07,247
Something seems wrong.

415
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:08,717
What do you mean?

416
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:11,617
They steal up-and-coming writers' ideas.

417
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,106
I heard they turn you into their slave.

418
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,936
Anyway, their reputation isn't good.

419
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:16,326
If you sign a contract with them,

420
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:19,267
you might end up being in planning forever.

421
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,267
At least they'll pay me signing bonus.

422
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,947
They will, but it'll be pennies.

423
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,506
Anyway, read the contract carefully

424
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,366
and bring it to me. I'll ask around.

425
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:29,997
Director, we're ready.

426
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,307
Just a second.

427
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,886
Ms. Kang, the shooting's about to start,

428
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:37,496
so don't sign anything just yet, okay?

429
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:41,596
But what if,

430
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,537
like the guy said,

431
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,717
this is the best opportunity for me?

432
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:49,407
You might end up in some serious trouble.

433
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,656
But it could work out.

434
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,807
It could work out really well.

435
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,616
If I can get the money...

436
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:56,196
Are you doing this for money?

437
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,266
Then, you'll definitely end up big trouble!

438
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:02,096
They can sniff out writers in need of money!

439
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,987
They'll suck you dry!

440
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:05,557
No, Ms. Kang! Don't do it!

441
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,707
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:07,587
I have to go.

443
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,956
Ms. Kang!

444
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:22,086
You're going to read every line?

445
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:24,186
This society is based on trust.

446
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:26,236
Do you see $100,000 there?

447
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,836
You'll get it when the contract is finalized.

448
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,616
I'm a man of my words.

449
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:36,926
Sign there.

450
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:44,156
They can sniff out writers in need of money!

451
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,366
They'll suck you dry!

452
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:48,966
No, Ms. Kang! Don't do it!

453
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,706
When you're gone,

454
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:54,597
several lower positions can be spared.

455
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,646
Get a conscience!

456
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,027
You're not going to sign it?

457
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,487
What?

458
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:16,226
If you don't want to, forget it.

459
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:17,297
No!

460
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,396
I'm signing it right now.

461
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:28,226
Oh, my!

462
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,867
What the heck are you doing?

463
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,446
I'm her mom,

464
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:36,756
so I'm going to do something here.

465
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:37,487
Mom.

466
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:38,447
Mom, what are you doing?

467
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:40,326
You don't know anything, so just leave.

468
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,856
I don't know anything? How do you know?

469
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,787
I know more about contracts than you do.

470
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:48,007
I worked at a bank for 10 years, you know?

471
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:49,317
Let me see this.

472
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,676
Signing bonus, $100,000.

473
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:06,096
See? I knew it.

474
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,896
It says $100,000,

475
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:08,676
but what?

476
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:11,366
The signing bonus is 10%?

477
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,716
And the contract period is 10 years?

478
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:17,707
Your drama must air within the first year to get the signing bonus?

479
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:19,007
What?

480
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:21,047
Hey!

481
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,086
Who are you?

482
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,727
How dare you try to con my daughter?

483
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,817
You think my daughter's on idiot?

484
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,406
Are you mad?

485
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:30,567
You want me to call the police?

486
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,057
We must call the police!

487
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:35,376
I'll call them and tell them to arrest you!

488
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,656
Mom, what are you doing? It's embarrassing!

489
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:37,966
What the heck!

490
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:38,947
How dare you!

491
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:42,196
Let go! What are you doing to my mom!

492
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:44,887
Why you little!

493
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:48,477
Mom, nice! Good job, mom!

494
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,357
How dare you call this a contract!

495
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:53,896
Good job, mom.

496
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:56,846
Such an idiot.

497
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:59,376
You have no street smarts.

498
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,507
Even if you're desperate,

499
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:04,116
you should know what's good or bad.

500
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,006
How did you know?

501
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:12,297
That producer named Heo Seonggeun called.

502
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:14,686
Oh, he conned you, but he couldn't stand

503
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:18,876
watching you being conned by someone else.

504
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,916
Don't laugh.

505
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:26,557
You don't have to do this.

506
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:28,527
If your dad found out what you did,

507
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:31,287
he'll be even more miserable.

508
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,466
Mom,

509
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:37,626
I'm sorry about the other night.

510
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,886
I'm hot. Get away from me.

511
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,297
She never says anything nice.

512
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:54,407
Don't act rashly for your dad's sake.

513
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:59,777
I can't do anything for him anyway.

514
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,966
You don't need to do anything.

515
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,697
I'll take care of dad.

516
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:06,946
When I get involved, things just work out.

517
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:09,336
I raised an idiot like you into a decent woman,

518
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:10,936
so nothing's impossible for me.

519
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,346
I'm Oh Minja.

520
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:34,477
What's this?

521
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:36,647
Is it a gift or a bribe?

522
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:39,307
Gift or bribe, I'm not the least interested

523
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,866
in giving anything to you, mom,

524
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:44,226
but Eunsu is so nice.

525
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:47,037
She made this with her pretty hands

526
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,727
to give to you!

527
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,886
Why did I ever give birth to him?

528
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,977
I should tell Hyeongyu to come home soon!

529
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,507
This mug is one of a kind.

530
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:23,747
This design was inspired by you.

531
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,426
Not bad.

532
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,537
- What? / - Huh?

533
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,787
Have you gone deaf?

534
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,106
I'm old.

535
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,916
I can't be bothered.

536
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,336
So go ahead and date. I don't care.

537
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,616
- Do you mean it? / - Really?

538
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:57,406
Why do you keep asking me that?

539
00:33:57,406 --> 00:33:59,146
You want me to take it back?

540
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,396
No...

541
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:02,277
No, mom!

542
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,096
We're just so happy, that's why, mom.

543
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,527
Don't be so happy.

544
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,557
My "Yes" means very little.

545
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:09,246
Mom...

546
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,716
Thank you.

547
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,527
But that's all.

548
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:15,336
Trying to break you up is a waste of energy.

549
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:16,697
That was hard on me, too.

550
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,527
I don't enjoy playing the bad guy, you know?

551
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:19,436
So keep dating.

552
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:21,586
Date as much as you want and break up.

553
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:24,146
But you handle your father. I can't.

554
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,786
You can't ask me that.

555
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:28,726
And please don't let your father catch you!

556
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:30,166
Don't show yourselves in front of him!

557
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,876
You're making me nervous!

558
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:36,987
Mom, see you at home.

559
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,586
Your father isn't happy about us?

560
00:34:46,157 --> 00:34:47,606
My father?

561
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:49,367
My father's just...

562
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,677
Just give it to me straight.

563
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:53,606
You're not good at lying.

564
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:54,916
I can tell.

565
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,977
He's doing it because he's not happy with me.

566
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,436
He'll get over it soon.

567
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:04,307
My father really likes you and Jiwan.

568
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,007
Oh, they sure look happy.

569
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,297
What are they so happy about?

570
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,307
I can't watch them anymore.

571
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,427
How disgusting.

572
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:29,486
But that sure beats him moping around.

573
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:31,717
Really? Sugyeong?

574
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:36,557
You didn't make that up to assure me, did you?

575
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:39,596
Why would I lie to you?

576
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,336
You said yes, so why wouldn't they say yes?

577
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:47,647
Right. If Sugyeong's okay, Taesu would be, too.

578
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:54,057
Did Sugyeong do anything to you?

579
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,996
No, she was very classy.

580
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,866
Sugyeong?

581
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,916
She never once raised her voice.

582
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,067
Sugyeong?

583
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,297
Actually...

584
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:12,007
She did say something bad, but just once.

585
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:15,697
I knew it.

586
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,836
What about Taesu?

587
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:25,576
He's always nice.

588
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:38,367
I got all your favorites, father.

589
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:43,197
I'm a great son, don't you think?

590
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:47,246
It's obvious you want something.

591
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,007
What do you want to tell me?

592
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:53,626
I respect you very much.

593
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:59,956
Yes, using flattery before offering a deal,

594
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,797
that's very important.

595
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:04,077
No, I'm not trying to offer a deal.

596
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:06,227
I really do respect you.

597
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,157
You've been dedicated to mom all your life.

598
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:13,027
She's my mom, so I don't understand why,

599
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:15,606
but I respect your taste in women.

600
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:19,257
Anyway, thank you for staying with mom.

601
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:28,456
And I'm trying to date a woman like her.

602
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:34,067
I know I made a big mistake.

603
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:36,447
And I know you're very angry about that.

604
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:40,277
But it was my fault, not Eunsu's, father.

605
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:48,817
I want to know why it can't be Eunsu.

606
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:54,437
Do you have any respect for me?

607
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:55,956
Of course, I do.

608
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,666
The respect I have for you,

609
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,846
no words in this world can describe it.

610
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,632
The man you respect that much

611
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:05,416
told you to break up with her,

612
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,036
so why can't you accept it,

613
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,176
thinking, "Oh, there must be a valid reason."

614
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:14,737
Tell me the reason.

615
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:18,856
Every decision I make is to

616
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:22,326
protect everything I built.

617
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:25,257
My house, my company,

618
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:29,217
and most of all, my family.

619
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,836
So you think

620
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:35,277
Eunsu will ruin everything you built?

621
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:36,827
Why would you think such a thing?

622
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,817
Do you know the advantage of

623
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,206
someone who has accomplished so much?

624
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:46,237
You don't need others to understand you.

625
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:47,876
I just need to make orders,

626
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,956
and the others must follow them.

627
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:51,886
If they don't want to follow my orders,

628
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:54,637
they can leave from

629
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:57,387
my house, my company and my territory.

630
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:00,817
Father.

631
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:06,407
Father...

632
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,077
Mr. Yun.

633
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:19,097
What is it?

634
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:20,746
What's going on?

635
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:29,527
Jiwan,

636
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,396
you are to appear at the Personnel Committee.

637
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:36,277
Why are they holding it so fast?

638
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:38,637
They already finished the investigation?

639
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,437
How would I know!

640
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:52,126
Welcome.

641
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,016
Hello.

642
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,677
Sit over there, please.

643
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:02,507
Okay.

644
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:07,206
What brings you here?

645
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:09,407
Well,

646
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,217
I dropped by because of Eunsu.

647
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:16,597
Thank you for not telling your mother

648
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,507
about what happened the other day.

649
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:22,657
Why would you thank me for that?

650
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:27,567
How do you know about Eunsu when we didn't?

651
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,836
I knew Mr. Kim very well.

652
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:34,786
So I found out about Eunsu.

653
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:40,626
Mr. Kim asked me to look after Eunsu.

654
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:43,336
But that's so weird.

655
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:46,887
Sangjun had Taesu,

656
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:51,646
so why did he ask you?

657
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:55,717
That's not something I can tell you.

658
00:40:55,717 --> 00:41:00,767
Anyway, thank you about Seonhui.

659
00:41:03,606 --> 00:41:08,277
I always wanted to ask,

660
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,567
but you're not, right?

661
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:15,376
Seonhui and you...

662
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:18,927
I mean,

663
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:21,117
you're not in a relationship,

664
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:23,007
are you?

665
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:27,347
No, we're not.

666
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:29,887
Right?

667
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,487
Mr. Shin, I'm...

668
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:35,916
I...

669
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,956
I have feelings...

670
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:43,737
Seonhui and I aren't in a relationship.

671
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,686
And we could never be.

672
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:47,456
I have a feeling

673
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:52,126
she doesn't even know what I do for a living.

674
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,226
She's not interested in me at all.

675
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:57,326
Excuse me?

676
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:02,017
She's relying on me only because there's

677
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:04,496
no one else she can talk to about Eunsu.

678
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,976
If it weren't for her daughter,

679
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,866
she would never even talk to me.

680
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:15,656
That means...

681
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:19,657
You're...

682
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,427
Excuse me.

683
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,416
You're Mr. Im, aren't you?

684
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,976
What is this about?

685
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:36,716
About the blueprints that got leaked.

686
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:37,856
What about them?

687
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:41,527
There's a possibility they might still be here.

688
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:43,947
We're keeping that in mind.

689
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:48,336
And we're looking into possible inside help.

690
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:51,757
You're already investigating that?

691
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,356
You think we're amateurs?

692
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,007
You think the blueprints are

693
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:01,077
still in the building because of the chip?

694
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:02,567
Do you?

695
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:05,166
They might be.

696
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,527
But any decent industrial spy would

697
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:11,787
check whether or not there is an embedded

698
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:13,336
security chip.

699
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:17,067
Those chips are for average thieves.

700
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:19,757
They're not effective on industrial spies.

701
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,207
Stop playing a detective and start

702
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:28,016
preparing for the Personnel Committee.

703
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:41,567
How could you not find anything yet?

704
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:45,016
When I got you all those documents?

705
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:49,016
No wonder Mr. Jang was confident about them.

706
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:50,656
What about the stockholders?

707
00:43:50,657 --> 00:43:54,146
Did you find the stockholders from the past?

708
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:57,086
Actually, we found something strange.

709
00:43:57,086 --> 00:43:58,306
Strange?

710
00:43:58,306 --> 00:44:00,196
There was a major investor when Best Global

711
00:44:00,197 --> 00:44:03,247
was founded, but no one knows his identity.

712
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:06,536
He bought Taehu Industry at the verge of

713
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:08,976
bankruptcy and made a huge investment,

714
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,777
but he resigned after just one year,

715
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,847
and nobody knows where he is now.

716
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:13,827
We looked for him,

717
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:17,427
but his address and phone number were fake.

718
00:44:17,427 --> 00:44:20,257
The president when the company was founded

719
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,726
might have been a president in name only.

720
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:29,897
So where did the investment come from?

721
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:37,916
I can't help feeling suspicious of Mr. Jang.

722
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:43,217
There seems to be a problem at Best Global.

723
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:45,206
They are trying to keep it under wraps,

724
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:48,106
but the new product blueprints were leaked.

725
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:50,617
The new product blueprints were leaked?

726
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:52,727
And the man they are suspecting

727
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:56,636
is the young man you were interested in.

728
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,467
You mean Jiwan?

729
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:28,507
We've had some issues lately.

730
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:30,047
Well...

731
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:33,317
Should I come see you?

732
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:36,967
I want to apologize.

733
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,497
It's okay, Seonhui. There's no need.

734
00:45:39,496 --> 00:45:41,027
I still don't like them dating.

735
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:42,257
How about you?

736
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:46,846
You've changed your mind?

737
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,817
You sound nice, so maybe you have.

738
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:55,757
I guess I shouldn't object so firmly.

739
00:45:55,757 --> 00:46:00,297
Listening to you being nice isn't so bad.

740
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:03,806
Sugyeong, the kids...

741
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:06,126
Whatever. I'm not going to care.

742
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:08,126
You shouldn't be worried about Eunsu now,

743
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:10,297
with what's happening with Jiwan and all.

744
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:12,947
With Jiwan?

745
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,376
What's happening?

746
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,547
You don't know?

747
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:18,896
He may not be your real son,

748
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:21,277
but you should pay more attention to him,

749
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:24,557
when there was such a huge incident at work.

750
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:26,407
What was it, Sugyeong?

751
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:30,257
What happened to Jiwan at work?

752
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:39,216
Jiwan is suspected of being an industrial spy.

753
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,497
My husband can only do so much.

754
00:46:42,496 --> 00:46:44,196
He may be Sangjun's son, but he must

755
00:46:44,197 --> 00:46:45,896
think of the other employees, too.

756
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,867
I'll be back.

757
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:03,697
Okay.

758
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:26,437
It's time to go to the investment presentation.

759
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:29,927
The Personnel Committee's today, too, right?

760
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,137
Yes.

761
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,677
He was a decent guy.

762
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:41,077
Should I tell them to go easy on him?

763
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:42,837
A normal company couldn't possibly

764
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:46,476
let an employee who leaked top secret stay.

765
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,957
Just let them decide on their own.

766
00:47:49,956 --> 00:47:50,956
Yes, sir.

767
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:57,447
Yes.

768
00:47:58,536 --> 00:47:59,776
Yes, I got it.

769
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:02,276
What happened?

770
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:06,007
Jiwan was sent to the Personnel Committee.

771
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:09,167
At this rate,

772
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,116
the outcome is obvious.

773
00:48:48,286 --> 00:48:49,676
Hello, mother.

774
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:56,537
Did you eat lunch?

775
00:48:56,536 --> 00:49:00,776
I haven't packed you lunch for a while.

776
00:49:00,777 --> 00:49:02,217
It's okay.

777
00:49:04,036 --> 00:49:05,216
Jiwan...

778
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:07,487
Mother, I have to be somewhere.

779
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,767
Jiwan.

780
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:14,496
Don't miss your meals.

781
00:49:16,237 --> 00:49:17,327
Don't worry.

782
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:20,177
I never miss my meals.

783
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,007
Okay. That's good.

784
00:49:24,856 --> 00:49:27,007
I have to go, mother.

785
00:49:49,516 --> 00:49:51,596
Seonhui, where are you?

786
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:56,057
You said you'd be here by lunch, but it's 4!

787
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,406
I'm sorry, Haengsuk. I forgot.

788
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:03,836
- Minja. / - Yes?

789
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:05,617
I'm needed at home. Can you step in for me?

790
00:50:05,617 --> 00:50:06,917
- I have to go. / - Don't worry about it.

791
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,226
I'm sorry. Thank you.

792
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:11,666
Oops.

793
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,637
Just don't do anything!

794
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,327
Why would you make a bigger mess?

795
00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:22,027
What's wrong with you today?

796
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:25,347
You think this is too much work?

797
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:28,142
Look, if it weren't for Seonhui,

798
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,936
you couldn't live here.

799
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:37,047
Mom, you believe everything she tells you?

800
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,617
Man!

801
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:40,757
I can't take this from you anymore.

802
00:50:40,757 --> 00:50:42,166
Do it all yourself!

803
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:44,697
Wait...

804
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:46,677
Mom!

805
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:50,616
How long are you going to tiptoe around Seonhui?

806
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:53,097
You didn't do anything wrong.

807
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:55,687
You were the one who always sided with her!

808
00:50:56,487 --> 00:51:00,146
Why have you been so mean to Seonhui lately?

809
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:05,076
You're just making yourself look bad.

810
00:51:05,077 --> 00:51:06,237
Be honest with me.

811
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,537
Isn't it because of Shin?

812
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:13,697
I knew it was because of Shin.

813
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:17,577
Stop barking up the wrong tree.

814
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,537
Even if he doesn't get Seonhui,

815
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:22,496
he would never even look at you.

816
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,297
Mom, you shouldn't trust Seonhui so much.

817
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:30,577
You're being horrible, so stop it.

818
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:33,767
Seonhui's personal life is clean.

819
00:51:33,766 --> 00:51:35,746
I've lived with her for a long time.

820
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:37,836
Sangjun is the only man for her.

821
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:42,696
Look how she dotes on Eunsu.

822
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:47,867
She's doing it because she's Sangjun's child.

823
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:50,727
Eunsu and Sangjun aren't related.

824
00:51:50,726 --> 00:51:52,666
She's not his blood.

825
00:52:01,947 --> 00:52:04,987
I should go back to making pancakes.

826
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:06,157
It'll get dark soon.

827
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:08,126
Hey,

828
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:10,047
what did you...

829
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:13,017
What did you just say?

830
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:16,227
What do you mean?

831
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,847
Eunsu's what?

832
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:25,787
Eunsu's not Sangjun's child?

833
00:52:25,786 --> 00:52:29,476
You said that, didn't you?

834
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:33,247
No, mom. I didn't.

835
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,036
You didn't?

836
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:36,806
No?

837
00:52:36,806 --> 00:52:39,346
Look into my eyes and tell me.

838
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:42,187
I, I didn't mean it.

839
00:52:42,186 --> 00:52:44,976
It was a slip of the tongue.

840
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:48,317
I'm serious, mom.

841
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:57,956
I knew you were acting strange lately.

842
00:52:57,956 --> 00:53:00,606
You were being mean to Seonhui.

843
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:06,466
I figured it was because of Shin,

844
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:08,277
but it wasn't?

845
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,436
It wasn't?

846
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,706
Was it,

847
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,047
was it really because of Eunsu?

848
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:17,616
Mom...

849
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:18,997
Tell me!

850
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,716
Or I'll die of frustration!

851
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:27,567
If Eunsu isn't Sangjun's blood,

852
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:29,186
who is she?

853
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:34,807
Did she have her with another man and lied?

854
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:37,856
Who is it?

855
00:53:37,856 --> 00:53:39,456
Is it Shin?

856
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:43,426
Was she with him before marrying Sangjun?

857
00:53:43,427 --> 00:53:44,977
No, mom!

858
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:46,817
That's not true!

859
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:48,016
She's not Seonhui's child either.

860
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,136
She has nothing to do with Seonhui or Sangjun.

861
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,606
- Oh... / - Mom.

862
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,767
Oh, no...

863
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:10,376
Mother.

864
00:54:11,336 --> 00:54:14,157
Mother, I'm late.

865
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:49,766
Is there any corrections you want to make

866
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:53,986
on your statement at the investigation

867
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:57,586
on the blueprint leakage on May 30th?

868
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:01,586
Is there?

869
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,627
There isn't.

870
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:29,226
I would like to thank all the domestic

871
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,886
and foreign investors for coming here.

872
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:35,576
For the past 23 years, Best Global has been

873
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:39,107
growing fast thanks to the transparent

874
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:42,016
and people-centric management.

875
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:45,476
Both customer satisfaction for our products

876
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:51,036
and employee satisfaction have been very high.

877
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,047
On top of that...

878
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:03,496
We've been focusing on innovation,

879
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:09,246
producing new products to lead the market.

880
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:13,856
We consider it an honor to be able to produce

881
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:16,427
a new protect that everyone likes this year.

882
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:18,177
We will use Mr. Kim Jiwan's statement

883
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:20,416
as the foundation of our judgment.

884
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:24,626
At the investigation by Audit,

885
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,826
you said you were responsible?

886
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:29,737
Yes, sir.

887
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:35,487
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

888
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:42,937
Leaking the blueprints was my fault.

889
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:49,567
But I didn't do it intentionally.

890
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:53,237
This company is my company.

891
00:56:53,907 --> 00:56:56,947
This is the first company that hired me.

892
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:59,916
This is where I want to build my future.

893
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:02,207
How could I

894
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,196
do such a thing to a place like that?

895
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:08,586
I swear

896
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:10,646
I never did it intentionally.

897
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:19,367
I hope you would believe that.

898
00:57:28,146 --> 00:57:30,067
We will take questions now.

899
00:57:31,847 --> 00:57:33,037
Yes?

900
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:36,856
What is your prediction on overseas sales?

901
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:37,887
Yes.

902
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,606
To be honest,

903
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:43,646
we're entering new overseas markets,

904
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:46,936
so short-term sales won't be very high.

905
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:49,856
But in terms of market share,

906
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:52,137
we've been growing very quickly.

907
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:55,287
You have the printout of that on your table.

908
00:57:55,286 --> 00:57:57,466
When the new product comes out,

909
00:57:57,467 --> 00:58:02,847
that growth will be significantly higher.

910
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:05,236
Just a second.

911
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:11,226
I heard your new product blueprints were stolen.

912
00:58:16,427 --> 00:58:19,217
If another country copies it,

913
00:58:19,217 --> 00:58:21,916
the financial loss will be quite significant.

914
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:26,706
Shouldn't you have informed us on it?

915
00:58:35,427 --> 00:58:37,606
Answer me, President Jang.

916
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,706
Is that true?

917
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:47,586
Let's say you didn't leak them intentionally.

918
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:49,567
Even if it was a mistake, the fact that

919
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,496
you caused damages doesn't change.

920
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:56,376
In your opinion, what do you think we should

921
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:59,137
do to an employee who made such a mistake?

922
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:02,467
Excuse me?

923
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:12,507
I'm sorry, Mr. Chair-person.

924
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,097
There's something I would like to say.

925
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:20,687
Mr. Kim Jiwan isn't the only one responsible.

926
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,697
I'm responsible for letting him go to such

927
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:27,767
an important contract meeting alone.

928
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:31,717
No, I'm the man to blame.

929
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:36,407
Mr. Kim Jiwan is a talented and devoted

930
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,967
employee who's worked harder than anyone.

931
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:42,336
Please show leniency.

932
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:44,646
We will address the issue of neglect

933
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:47,257
from the management at another time.

934
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:51,777
Today we will only deal with the leakage.

935
00:59:51,777 --> 00:59:54,537
- But... / - Mr. Yun, be quiet!

936
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:57,076
You might be making things worse for him!

937
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,797
Answer me.

938
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,817
If it were you, what kind of

939
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:05,197
disciplinary action would you take against

940
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:07,927
an employee who made such a mistake?

941
01:00:21,356 --> 01:00:23,657
I think he should be fired.

942
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:24,277
Jiwan!

943
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:27,496
Is there anything else you want to add?

944
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:32,116
No, sir.

945
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:36,367
We will decide on the disciplinary action.

946
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:45,157
What happened?

947
01:01:15,617 --> 01:01:19,797
We have decided on the disciplinary action.

948
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:23,586
Mr. Kim Jiwan.

949
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:28,027
You're fired.

950
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,376
Should you have any objections...

951
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:36,246
Sir.

952
01:01:36,637 --> 01:01:38,717
I object.
