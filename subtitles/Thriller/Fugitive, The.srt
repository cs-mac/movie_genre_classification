1
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,959
What do you mean?

2
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,996
Why would His Highness discard
Your Majesty, the Queen?

3
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:36,502
What are you doing? Quickly ready the 
sedan chair to go to the King's Quarters.

4
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:43,108
Mother, please take back
the words you just said.

5
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:46,045
You're clearly unwell.

6
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,816
What's the big deal about me being unwell?

7
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:53,752
Even if I'm throwing up blood,
I still need to go over.

8
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:58,524
Going there, I'll say everything
as the Crown Prince wishes.

9
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:02,928
Your Majesty! There will really be 
big trouble if you keep at it like this.

10
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:06,599
All right.

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,902
Quickly prepare the sedan chair.

12
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:14,306
I need to accompany Her Majesty
to the King's Quarters to visit Father.

13
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:15,407
Your Highness.

14
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,977
Hyeongnim.
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)

15
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,179
What Hyeongnim?

16
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,849
How can you address the Crown Prince
who is to become king in a private manner?

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,621
Do you wish to be discarded too?

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:35,961
Do you really want others to say
the Crown Prince discarded his brother?

19
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:41,467
Then let's go.

20
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,073
You mustn't, Hyeongnim.

21
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:55,414
Your Highness, you mustn't go.

22
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:59,787
Please stop quarrelling with Mother.

23
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,223
If Your Highness and Mother
quarrel like this,

24
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:08,994
what am I to do?

25
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:19,638
If she turns out to be that way,

26
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:26,245
His Majesty will truly be in grievous despair.

27
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,117
<i>Your Highness.</i>

28
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:37,990
<i>The Eastern Palace has sent message
that there's an urgent matter.</i>

29
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,293
He has really awaken, right?

30
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,230
Yes, Your Highness.

31
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:01,847
Indeed, this is how it is.

32
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:05,518
You dare trespass here?

33
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,555
The two of you should have been
taken care of long ago.

34
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:15,794
Like how you killed Do Saeng,
you're going to kill the two of us?

35
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,632
Why'd you do it? Why?

36
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,935
What exactly did Do Saeng do wrong?

37
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:33,606
Soon the whole world will know
you're the true killer.

38
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,643
So when you arrive at King Yama's,
earnestly beg for forgiveness from him.

39
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,478
His Highness will be here soon.

40
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,883
You may need to let me go before then,

41
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,920
if you wish to save your daughter's life.

42
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,661
She's called Rang?
She's quite unwell.

43
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,463
My Rang, how...

44
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,601
She came to my residence as a servant girl.

45
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,788
Wake up!

46
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,825
Your Highness.

47
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,076
<i>If you don't believe it,
you can ask female physician Da In.</i>

48
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:48,480
<i>She's currently at my residence
treating your daughter.</i>

49
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,986
<i>How did she end up with you?</i>

50
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,656
<i>As a human being,
how could you do such a thing...</i>

51
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:02,795
<i>So, if you wish to save your daughter,</i>

52
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,364
<i>kill that fellow Deok Pal.</i>

53
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,615
Are you all right?

54
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,083
Yes.

55
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,019
I heard that he woke up.

56
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,955
Yes.

57
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,525
But...

58
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,461
Perhaps...

59
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,105
He hasn't stopped breathing yet.

60
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,419
If female physician Da In didn't alert us
ahead of time to strengthen the guard,

61
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,191
Choe Won and Deok Pal
would have long been killed.

62
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,760
They all appear to be 
assassins from the Ming Empire.

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,430
To find out the instigators behind it,
I fear that it won't be easy.

64
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,265
Indeed it would.

65
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,606
Tonight's matters mustn't get out
of the Eastern Palace.

66
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,542
If matters relating to Choe Won
and Deok Pal were to get out,

67
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:27,580
not only I, it's even quite probable that
Father will be implicated too.

68
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,415
Do you understand?

69
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,250
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,665
Indeed it would be that way.

71
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:48,501
If the matter is escalated now,

72
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,804
his concealment of Choe Won
would also be uncovered.

73
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,543
Anyway,

74
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:59,879
since it's so difficult to kill this Deok Pal, we should 
let it get out that Choe Won is in the Eastern Palace.

75
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,118
Before that happens, 
Choe Won will kill Deok Pal.

76
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,421
Very well.

77
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:12,358
However, if you fail this time too,

78
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:17,862
the next secret order will have your name on it.

79
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:30,709
Today, once again, the innocent
have died because of me.

80
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,380
Back in the day when your grandfather passed,

81
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,385
I vowed not to let anyone
die because of me again.

82
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:45,024
It was also because of me that
Jubu Min suffered a ruthless murder.

83
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,795
I was also at fault for Jubu Min's death.

84
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,136
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,806
You suffered unjustly because of me.

86
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,375
Not only have I been unable
to help clear your name,

87
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,780
I had you carry the heavy burden
of having to save him.

88
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,083
But what else can be done?

89
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,386
Only by saving him,
am I able to live,

90
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,956
and you are able to live.

91
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,296
What are you saying?

92
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:28,701
If her high fever continues unabated,
her life will be in danger.

93
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,573
You must have her live.
I have no need for a dead body!

94
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,951
<i>Just pretend you didn't see me here.</i>

95
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,521
<i>Kill Deok Pal within 2 days.</i>

96
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>That way, I'll have you and your daughter
escape to Ming China to live.</i>

97
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,213
<i>You must save him.</i>

98
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:19,718
<i>It's not merely for you and me.
It will protect your dear Rang as well, isn't it?</i>

99
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,650
I took Deok Pal's pulse yesterday.

100
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,853
His cun-guan-chi pulses are all weak.
(Cun-guan-chi - 3 locations along the wrist)

101
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,890
I fear that he doesn't have much more time.

102
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,927
How about telling His Highness
about this sooner?

103
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,129
That cannot be done.

104
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,167
It's better not to have His Highness
hang onto false hopes...

105
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,736
I will hold out until the end.

106
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,609
Anyway, could you have
Da In come see me?

107
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,178
That cannot be done.

108
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:25,050
I don't want Da In to be re-entangled
in these matters and exposed to such plight.

109
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,886
I know I'm being selfish,

110
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:31,657
but it concerns the life of my daughter.

111
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,226
I beg of you.

112
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,567
Why didn't you tell me?

113
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,136
That my Rang is at 
Gim Chi Yong's residence.

114
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,705
How did you know?

115
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm really sorry.

116
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,211
You're focused on treating Deok Pal ajussi.
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

117
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,615
I feared that telling you would
bring harm to the matter at hand.

118
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,817
Does that make any sense?

119
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:03,222
Why it is that I'm like this,
don't you know better than anyone?

120
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,525
I didn't think it through very well.

121
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:12,765
But how did you know Rang is over there?

122
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,536
Last night, I met Gim Chi Yong.

123
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:23,776
He told me, if I don't kill Deok Pal
by tomorrow night,

124
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,079
he wouldn't let my Rang off unscathed.

125
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,916
How can a human being do such a thing?

126
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,420
My Lord, how did you respond?

127
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,090
What else could I have said?

128
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:48,734
However, My Lord...
Rang has been having a high fever.

129
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,936
A high fever?

130
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,543
<i>Right now, the most important thing is to
rescue Rang from Gim Chi Yong's residence.</i>

131
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,846
<i>Quickly deliver this letter to Heukseokgok.</i>

132
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,906
What on earth did Horse Thief write on here?

133
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,044
I'm dead curious!

134
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,980
You won't die from curiosity.

135
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,183
Hurry up and polish this.

136
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,422
What is this? 
What on earth does it say?

137
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,725
What on earth are you 
grumbling about, So Baek?

138
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,662
Father, how could you be
defecating for half the day?

139
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,332
This is from Horse Thief to you.

140
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,800
Is it?

141
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:03,976
The black is words.
The white is paper.

142
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,279
I can't bear to look.

143
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,152
Like Father, like daughter.
What ignorance.

144
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,455
You. All that time you use
talking about those two balls,

145
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,758
when you could be learning Hangeul.
Have I told you before, or not?

146
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,594
You have.

147
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,264
Aigoo, you just know a few words.
Such a show off.
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

148
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,934
You're so stingy,
I'm not listening.

149
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,871
How will that work?

150
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,541
This is Horse Thief's letter.
You have to listen.

151
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:41,046
Right? Even if she's so stingy
I still have to listen, huh?

152
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,552
- Here, here, here.
- Aigoo.

153
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,031
Everyone at Heukseokgok,
are you well?

154
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:04,170
I haven't yet repaid the debt from before.

155
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,611
Now, I have another matter to request of you.
I'm too ashamed to see you.

156
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:18,117
My daughter Rang is currently in dire straits.

157
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:24,356
She is currently in Right State Councillor,
Lord Gim Chi Yong's residence

158
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:28,761
being held...
Being held?

159
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,798
What?

160
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,367
That child is in danger?

161
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,203
Where is that place?

162
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,038
Gim whoever's residence, Granny?

163
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,506
No!

164
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,974
Oh my. You scared me!

165
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,543
Father, why did you shout?

166
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,214
It's not the Royal Investigation Bureau,
it's Gim whoever's residence.

167
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,416
To take a child out of that type of place,

168
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,251
it's a piece of cake.

169
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,187
That...
When I say you can't, then you can't.

170
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,655
I don't care.

171
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,592
Father, if you're like that, 
then you aren't a friend.

172
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,161
If it wasn't for the Horse Thief, 
you wouldn't be all safe like now.

173
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,996
Kkeok Jeong!

174
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,198
You can go.

175
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,767
- I want to go too.
- No.

176
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,337
Why aren't you letting me go?

177
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,805
It's a piece of cake.

178
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,242
<i>I already said no.</i>

179
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,513
Really! 
Enemies often cross each other's path.

180
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,789
Do you really want to handle 
Choe Won's daughter like that?

181
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,460
I've already bet my life on 
this to Her Majesty, the Queen.

182
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:41,066
If I want Choe Won to get 
rid of Deok Pal quickly,

183
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:46,205
letting him see his daughter dying 
is considered is the safest method.

184
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,040
If it's not done properly,

185
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,647
and his daughter dies before Deok Pal does, 
what are you going to do?

186
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:59,785
Your adopted daughter, Da In, 
doesn't seem like she'll let her die.

187
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,190
<i>My Lord, everything is prepared.</i>

188
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,099
My Lord, look.

189
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,073
Isn't she Choe Won's daughter?

190
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,451
We're from Lord Gim Chi Yong's residence.

191
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,754
Go back and watch over the 
Right State Councillor's residence.

192
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:36,856
Yes.

193
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,095
Didn't he say that he wanted to use 
her as bait to catch Choe Won?

194
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,297
But why is she sent to the palace?

195
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,005
I'm the Royal Investigation Bureau's 
Inspector Lee Jeong Hwan.

196
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,574
That palanquin that just went in...

197
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,420
Where is that kid who is sick?

198
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,091
She isn't here right now.

199
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,293
I know that she's here.

200
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,229
If you're going to trick me, you're dead.

201
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,533
I already said she isn't here.

202
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,570
His Lordship took her to the palace.

203
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,240
What? The palace?

204
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,809
Are you referring to the 
palace where the king lives?

205
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,948
I secretly came out with father knowing.

206
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,618
Kkeok Jeong, can the places that you
go to not have me, So Baek?

207
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,757
What's so great about this place
that father didn't let me come here?

208
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,959
There's nothing.

209
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:04,210
Is Kkeok Jeong really going to take the 
lead in stealing the tribute this time?

210
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,146
Chief, your right hand man is me!

211
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,917
What is it?
Let's go straight to the palace.

212
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,385
The palace isn't a place that anyone can go to.

213
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,486
I'm not anyone!

214
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,423
I'm Yangju's Iron Hammer's...

215
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,359
Father...

216
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,179
Father, that...
The Horse Thief's daughter is in the palace.

217
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,583
That Lord Gim whoever 
brought her to the palace.

218
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,152
We were one step too late.

219
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,089
So...

220
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,658
you want to go to the palace?

221
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,227
If I don't do that, 
the Horse Thief's daughter will be in danger.

222
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,328
If you're going into the palace,

223
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:00,366
what about you?
Won't you be in danger too?

224
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,403
There is a way that isn't really dangerous.

225
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,212
Rang isn't at your residence.

226
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,781
Didn't you leave Rang's treatment to me?

227
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,249
How could you move Rang 
who is having such a high fever...

228
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:22,388
I was about to call for you.

229
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,260
If you want to keep treating that child,

230
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,829
you have to do one thing for me first.

231
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,421
His Lordship, 
only wants me to bring him inside.

232
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,342
Rang.

233
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,465
Rang.

234
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,375
Rang...

235
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,588
Before the hour of the Pig tomorrow night...
(9-11pm)

236
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,423
If by then,

237
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,726
Deok Pal has yet to turn into
a frigid corspe,

238
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:14,700
you'll see this child turn into 
a frigid corpse.

239
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:30,482
Did you see Rang?

240
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,520
My Lord.

241
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,091
Please help me.

242
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,872
Who are you?

243
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:28,107
Can we really slip into the palace
by carrying these things?

244
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,320
Where are the goods from?

245
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,990
These are the tributes from Gangwon Province.

246
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,496
If I had those two balls as well, 
it'll be just right.

247
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:55,267
Why didn't those things grow 
at the bottom but at the top?

248
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,204
Isn't that right, guys?

249
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,645
Let me see your identification tag and pass.

250
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,454
Follow me.

251
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,263
Everything is here.

252
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,098
All of you may leave when it's unloaded.

253
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

254
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,768
I have something else to do in the palace...

255
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,439
You can go.

256
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:39,678
Wow, Kkeok Jeong.
You seem just like a real one.

257
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:44,083
You'll die if you say 
the wrong things in here.

258
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,865
Where exactly is Rang?

259
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,801
I'm hungry.
I want to eat pig trotters.

260
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,940
- Quieten down.
- I want to eat pig trotters.

261
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,547
My legs...

262
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:18,951
Where exactly is Rang?

263
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:25,925
Why is this palace so big? 
Seriously...

264
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:15,008
I can't harm you in order to 
save my daughter's life.

265
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,912
But...

266
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:29,054
not being able to continue 
giving you treatment... I'm sorry.

267
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,540
This is related to this child 
and there's no time.

268
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,211
Please help me notify the Supervisor.

269
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,228
The cold wind keeps coming in through here,

270
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,696
so I want to move the child further back.

271
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,367
Can you give me a hand?

272
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,505
I got it.

273
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,134
He has already stopped breathing, 
Your Highness.

274
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,703
What are you talking about?

275
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,740
That's not possible.

276
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:13,118
How can...
How can this be?

277
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:21,560
Where is Choe Won?
Where did he go?

278
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:43,215
Quickly take Rang.

279
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,151
This is something that Lord Gim Chi Yong did.

280
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:51,290
They are the ones who killed Deok Pal 
and took Choe Won away too.

281
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,859
Royal Guard Seo, quickly go and 
check on Gim Chi Yong.

282
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,530
Yes, Your Highness.

283
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:12,578
Your Highness.

284
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,514
What am I going to say to father this time?

285
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:20,286
When His Majesty asked me 
about Deok Pal's condition before,

286
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:24,323
I already said that he wouldn't recover so easily.

287
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,993
Although he looks very disappointed,

288
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:36,802
he's even more worried that Your Highness 
is sad about this matter and 
even causing harm to your body.

289
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,637
Father.

290
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,472
But...

291
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:45,978
His Majesty doesn't know that 
Lord Bongsa Choe is treating Deok Pal,

292
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:50,382
so Your Highness must 
keep concealing this point.

293
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,585
I wonder.

294
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,420
Even if I want to conceal it,

295
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:01,760
it'll be useless if Lord Gim Chi Yong 
has captured Choe Won.

296
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,734
Is that true?

297
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,670
Is that fellow, Deok Pal, really dead?

298
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,873
Yes, that's correct.

299
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,075
So that's how it is?

300
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,846
My Lord, it's fine now.

301
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,415
<i>A parent who has lost 
their child is indeed scary.</i>

302
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:27,453
<i>Choe Won actually betrayed the Crown Prince
and listened to your orders.</i>

303
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,756
But... 
the matter of Choe Won disappearing,

304
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:34,059
His Highness is currently suspecting you.

305
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,160
<i>What did you say?</i>

306
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,097
Then... Choe Won that bastard,

307
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,767
he isn't with the Crown Prince 
at the Eastern Palace right now?

308
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,007
My Lord. My Lord!

309
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:06,358
He shouldn't have gone far.

310
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,928
What are you doing?
Quickly go and capture him!

311
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:09,662
Yes.

312
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,407
Hey, stop right there.

313
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,609
Hold on a moment.

314
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,849
Why are you holding a child?

315
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,684
T-T-That...

316
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:32,785
She's a young palace maid.

317
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,088
Because she suddenly had a fever, 
so we are sending her out of the palace.

318
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,860
Father...

319
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,264
What?
Father?

320
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:50,035
You really make people suspicious.
The both of you, follow me.

321
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,679
Horse Thief.

322
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,249
Why are you two here?

323
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:08,020
Didn't you beg me?
You told me to save your daughter.

324
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,323
Even so, 
you enter the palace just like that?

325
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:16,095
My Lord, quickly get out of here 
before anyone discovers you.

326
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,297
Will you be okay?

327
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:21,233
Don't worry about me.

328
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,537
What are you doing?
Quickly go.

329
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,409
Then I'll leave first.

330
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,181
That's right. 
Now isn't the time to be eyeing each other.

331
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,750
Let's quickly get out.

332
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,420
I didn't have enough time to 
say goodbye to the Crown Prince.

333
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,559
You must tell the Crown Prince the 
reason that I can only do this.

334
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,467
You've worked hard.

335
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:16,655
Horse Thief, quickly come out.

336
00:34:31,337 --> 00:34:32,438
Stop right there!

337
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,018
Quickly go.

338
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,561
Wait... this is...

339
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,130
Stop!

340
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:56,488
Your Highness, this is the Galhwa hangover soup.
(treats hangover and beneficial to the liver)

341
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,792
I'm really sorry.

342
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:04,196
You really wanted to clear 
Choe Won of his injustice,

343
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:11,537
but because of my incompetence, Choe Won will 
probably be framed just like Jubu Min.

344
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:17,776
Choe Won that person, if he still
hasn't shown his face to me,

345
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,447
he has probably been 
caught by Lord Gim Chi Yong.

346
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,915
Your Highness.

347
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:28,053
Do I have to qualifications 
to be called "Your Highness"?

348
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:33,559
After pushing a precious friend 
towards death's door,

349
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,330
I'm only able to act like a drunk here.

350
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,012
This won't do.
I have to settle things with Lord Gim Chi Yong.

351
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,847
Your Highness.

352
00:36:55,948 --> 00:37:02,188
Lord Bongsa Choe, 
isn't in their hands right now.

353
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,757
What did you say?

354
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,427
His Lordship...

355
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:13,933
has probably safely left the palace now.

356
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:20,539
His Lordship told me that 
I must let Your Highness know.

357
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,210
He apologizes that he's leaving without 
saying goodbye to Your Highness,

358
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,045
and not being able 
to save Deok Pal ajussi...

359
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:29,715
Is he really all right?

360
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:34,854
Yes, he's fine.

361
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:40,726
It is really fortunate.
It really is fortunate.

362
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,774
When I was following Lord Gim Chi Yong,

363
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,711
I discovered this at an abandoned
storehouse in the palace.

364
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,179
Lord Gim Chi Yong,

365
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,748
seems to have locked up 
a child who is ill inside.

366
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:03,849
What?

367
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:07,887
It seems to be Choe Won's daughter.

368
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:10,823
Choe Won's daughter?

369
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:13,025
That's right.

370
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:17,429
This is the bag that Rang 
uses to keep her medicine.

371
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:22,568
I left it there when I was 
giving treatment to Rang.

372
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:22,568


373
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:44,590
Does this really belong to Rang?

374
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,627
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:25,331
Omo, she's boiling.
(Omo - oh my)

376
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,799
Hey, kid.

377
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:31,570
Quickly bring down the fever 
and open your eyes, okay?

378
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:38,177
<i>No matter what medicine 
I use it is of no help.</i>

379
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:41,480
<i>Sa Hyeol Chim was also ineffective.</i>

380
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:07,907
That... 
Are you going to use that to prick the child?

381
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:11,210
If there's a mistake in administering...

382
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:35,801
Is it because of me that you didn't put it in?

383
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,573
But Kkeok Jeong...

384
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:43,142
Why isn't Kkeok Jeong back yet?

385
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:03,364
Where did that bastard Choe Won run off to?

386
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,366
I won't tell you.

387
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:11,403
Well, if you don't tell me,
let's see how long you can hang on for.

388
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,186
Seriously, this...

389
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:43,335
You scoundrel, 
who do you think you are acting wildly towards?

390
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:51,777
<i>He definitely said that he 
wanted to use that child as a bait,</i>

391
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:55,447
<i>to lure Choe Won to 
His Lordship's residence.</i>

392
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:58,384
<i>But unexpectedly he brought 
the child to the palace.</i>

393
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:00,219
<i>Inspector!</i>

394
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:04,256
We saw Choe Won.

395
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:05,357
Choe Won?

396
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,294
Yes.
He was with his sick daughter that was here.

397
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:11,230
What?
Then why didn't you capture him?

398
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:16,001
That...
He sided with a group of bandits and escaped.

399
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,305
They are Yangju's Iron Hammer's bandits.

400
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:21,874
They are the people who launched a 
surprised attack at the Royal Investigation Bureau 
when they broke out of prison last time.

401
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:24,076
Yangju's Iron Hammer's bandits...

402
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:24,810
Yes.

403
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,012
One of them is a girl who is like a rash fellow,

404
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,582
and the other is a man 
with a hairstyle like worms.

405
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:33,252
Then that means Choe Won is on 
the same sides as those people

406
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:36,188
and took the child from the palace.

407
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,023
Then...

408
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:42,061
why did Lord Gim Chi Yong 
bring that child to the palace...

409
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,300
So in other words,

410
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,439
the Right State Councillor's name doesn't need 
to be written in the secret order anymore?

411
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:56,742
His Lordship has already 
used Choe Won's daughter,

412
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,779
to order Choe Won to kill Deok Pal.

413
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:04,083
Then what about letting Choe Won escape?

414
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,918
He'll be caught very soon.

415
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,854
He definitely can't escape very far, 
whilst taking his sick daughter along.

416
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:08,854


417
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,790
If that girl, Da In, didn't get involved...

418
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,195
If Merchant Jang adopted daughter
didn't cause trouble, this time we could have...

419
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,131
Da In?

420
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:21,700
Are you referring to the female physician 
who attends to His Majesty's illness?

421
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,801
Yes.

422
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:26,472
She said that Choe Won is her savior,

423
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:29,775
so she even wagers her life to help Choe Won.

424
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:34,914
I really want to get rid of 
her without anyone knowing,

425
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:37,850
but her adopted father is 
His Lordship's right hand man

426
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,786
and our money tree.

427
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,254
Is that so?

428
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:47,026
She has some uses, 
so I'm still observing her.

429
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:50,696
We'll be needing her in order 
to catch Choe Won this time too.

430
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:54,067
Okay.
Then I'll keep an eye out for her too.

431
00:43:55,467 --> 00:44:00,973
Anyway, our pitiful Crown Prince is 
probably very sad right now.

432
00:43:56,936 --> 00:44:00,973


433
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,643
He boastfully said that
he would stab me in the back.

434
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,213
In the end, didn't all of that fizzle?

435
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,415
<i>That's right.</i>

436
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:14,186
He could even be feeling light 
headed and foaming in the mouth!

437
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:16,388
He's still the cornerstone of 
this country right now,

438
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:19,692
how can he be showing his ugly side to people?

439
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:21,527
<i>No.</i>

440
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:24,830
We should quickly pull him down from 
being the corner stone of this country.

441
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:31,804
Without you telling me, I've already 
planned to stab the Crown Prince in the back.

442
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:43,182
I'm curious as to whether
that bait is doing well.

443
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:45,751
After all she is a weak child.

444
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,687
As expected the 
Red Demon's intuition isn't ordinary.

445
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:52,725
That child isn't at my residence now.

446
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:54,193
Not here?

447
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,028
What do you mean by that...

448
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:58,230
I'm not sure how 
His Highness knew about this.

449
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,901
He sent people to secretly take 
that child back to the palace.

450
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:03,736
This is the order from His Highness who 
is going to ascend the throne in the future,

451
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,571
how can I reject him?

452
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:08,874
So, then at the palace...

453
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,810
You already know everything.

454
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,582
So you also knew that 
Choe Won was in the palace, right?

455
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:19,885
So the person who hid 
Choe Won in the palace

456
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:22,087
is also the Crown Prince?

457
00:45:23,923 --> 00:45:26,859
How can he shield a treasonous criminal?

458
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:29,428
He doesn't even think of how big of a crime it 
is to hide a treasonous criminal in the palace.

459
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:33,465
Exactly.

460
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:38,971
This is an issue that 
can't be let go so easily.

461
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:50,349
Have you found out anything?

462
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,184
I heard from the slaves talking that

463
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:55,855
that fellow with the worm-like hairstyle from
that group of bandits has been brought here.

464
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:55,855


465
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,424
Is that so?

466
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:14,940
We're unable to serve the Crown Prince 
who is colluding with a traitor!

467
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,345
- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.
- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.

468
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:25,217
Please take back the decree of abdicating for the 
Crown Prince who believes in the traitor Jo Gwang Jo!

469
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:28,888
- Please take back the decree, Your Majesty!
- Please take back the decree, Your Majesty!

470
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:32,925
With the unfilial matter of the Crown Prince attempting 
to stab Her Majesty, the Queen in the back,

471
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:36,962
how can we respect him as
the cornerstone of the nation?

472
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:41,367
<i>- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.
- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.</i>

473
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:46,138
<i>- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.
- Please observe clearly, Your Majesty.</i>

474
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:08,527
Mother, please help hyeongnim...

475
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:11,463
Please help His Highness, the Crown Prince.

476
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,299
Grand Prince.

477
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:17,336
I have been abandoned by the Crown Prince 
a long time ago, so what can I do?

478
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,171
Mother.

479
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,842
His Highness hasn't really abandoned you.

480
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:25,044
Otherwise he wouldn't have 
listened to my request

481
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:28,347
to come and see you, Mother.

482
00:47:37,156 --> 00:47:40,092
Grand Prince, you say that because 
there's something that you don't know.

483
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:46,699
The Crown Prince wrote "The king of flowers" 
on a Paulownia tree leaf to insult me.

484
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:51,470
Furthermore, he colluded with traitors 
named Ravine patriots to attempt a rebellion.

485
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,406
No.
How can you say rebellion?

486
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:57,343
How can you say something so scary...

487
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:58,811
Grand Prince.

488
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,279
His Highness...

489
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:03,582
Hyeongnim is definitely not that type of person.

490
00:48:03,582 --> 00:48:07,987
Hyeongnim is very filial and loyal,

491
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:10,189
as his brother I'm very clear on that.

492
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:14,593
Mother, in fact you know that 
hyeongnim isn't that type of person.

493
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:19,365
So are you saying that 
you're going to disobey me?

494
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,503
Mother, that's not what I mean...

495
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:28,541
Quiet! 
I don't want to see you, so quickly leave.

496
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,743
Mother...

497
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:42,121
Do you want me to become those people 
who have no tolerance and shout loudly?

498
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:49,461
No. I should live up to the expectation
of the status of the country's sovereign King.

499
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:54,600
So, you must be good and listen to me.

500
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,903
Isn't that right?

501
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:23,963
These are petitions that all the 
Royal Court officials have submitted.

502
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:29,468
With one voice, they all plea that 
you take back the abdication.

503
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:33,506
There are also petitions there, pleading 
to take away the Crown Prince of his position.

504
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:40,112
Your Majesty, His Highness's filiality and conduct,

505
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:42,681
is something that all the people know.

506
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:45,985
Bad rumours are spreading now,

507
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:50,756
is because it's a scheme to corner His Highness.

508
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:54,793
- That's right, it's only a scheme.
- That's right, it's only a scheme.

509
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,996
How can it be said to be a scheme?

510
00:49:56,996 --> 00:50:01,033
Then that letter that was found 
in the Crown Prince's greenhouse...

511
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:05,804
that letter from colluding with the Ravine patriots, 
what is the meaning of it?

512
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:25,991
Are you able to come up and refute the 
matters mentioned in these petitions?

513
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:39,205
Listen carefully.

514
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:50,216
I admit that the thought of abdicating 
to the Crown Prince is a bit hasty.

515
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:56,822
I'll take back the decree of abdicating.

516
00:50:57,189 --> 00:51:01,961
- Your Majesty, please investigate thoroughly.
- Your Majesty, please investigate thoroughly.

517
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:05,998
- Your grace is bountiful.
- Your grace is bountiful.

518
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:17,009
However Your Majesty, there are still 
some bad rumours regarding His Highness.

519
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:22,515
Because this matter can't be let go easily, 
so please forgive me for being bold.

520
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:29,855
There are rumours saying that His Highness 
hid treasonous criminal Choe Won

521
00:51:29,855 --> 00:51:33,893
at the Eastern Palace secretly.

522
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:38,664
Not only does he believe the 
treasonous criminal Jo Gwang Jo,

523
00:51:38,664 --> 00:51:44,537
he even hid a treasonous criminal in the palace. 
Furthermore, it was at the Eastern Palace.

524
00:51:46,372 --> 00:51:52,244
It's far from enough to just take back 
the decree of abdicating alone on this matter.

525
00:51:52,244 --> 00:51:56,282
That's correct.
Even if he is the cornerstone of the nation,

526
00:51:56,282 --> 00:52:02,521
he should be severely punished 
for disobeying the law.

527
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:42,895
As long as this matter ends smoothly...

528
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:49,502
What should we do about this matter?

529
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:54,640
Hasn't His Majesty already taken back 
the decree to abdicate for the Crown Prince?

530
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,576
For fear of violent backlash on 
the original plan for abdication,

531
00:52:57,576 --> 00:52:59,778
in the end it became like this.

532
00:52:59,778 --> 00:53:02,715
Since the only witness who can 
destroy the Soyun faction has died,

533
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,917
the Soyun faction has waited for this chance,

534
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:10,055
to say His Highness has colluded with us, 
Ravine patriots, to attempt a rebellion.

535
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:12,258
The matter of disposing the 
Crown Prince is already being discussed,

536
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:15,194
so us being treated as traitors and 
being killed is only a matter of time.

537
00:53:12,992 --> 00:53:15,194


538
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:17,396
We have to think of a plan.

539
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:28,407
We should prevail.

540
00:53:28,774 --> 00:53:30,609
If that is so,

541
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:35,381
then shouldn't we gather our strength 
and help His Highness?

542
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:37,950
If His Majesty does dethrone the Crown Prince...

543
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,721
How could we know if this is
helping him or harming him?

544
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,557
Amongst the people who are 
struggling against poverty

545
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:47,126
and are unable to use a sickle or pickaxe,

546
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:50,796
and can only take another person's life 
to be able to live in this world.

547
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:58,137
His Highness should be able to turn this 
crisis into an opportunity himself.

548
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:03,275
If he wants to become a wise king who really 
cares for the people who are hungry and cold,

549
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:07,680
he must be able to accomplish 
this kind of matter easily.

550
00:54:10,983 --> 00:54:13,552
Bongcheon, Gangnyeong, Ungjindeung

551
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:16,488
and Hamgyeong Province, 
how is the training going?

552
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:21,994
I heard that there is a lack
of weapons and food there.

553
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,499
Use this to replenish the stock.

554
00:54:28,234 --> 00:54:35,574
Now is the time to train in 
order to combat the enemy.

555
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:35,574


556
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:44,750
What to do...

557
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:48,787
The places that I go to, 
Kkeok Jeong will definitely go too.

558
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:51,724
Why hasn't he come yet?

559
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:53,926
Could it be...

560
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,495
He is injured?

561
00:54:56,495 --> 00:55:01,267
No, it can't be.
Kkeok Jeong is very skilled in fighting.

562
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:04,570
Then could it be...

563
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:09,341
He got caught?
No, no way.

564
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:13,379
Even if Kkeok Jeong was caught, 
he can successfully escape.

565
00:55:14,113 --> 00:55:16,315
Father...

566
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:19,251
Rang.

567
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:23,656
Oh my, she seems to 
have said "Father" just then.

568
00:55:26,592 --> 00:55:30,262
Kid, your father is here.

569
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:34,667
Quickly open your eyes.
That way you can see him.

570
00:55:37,603 --> 00:55:39,577
<i>Oh my, oh my.</i>

571
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:52,284
Father...

572
00:55:55,221 --> 00:56:01,460
I'm your father's friend.
Your father is here.

573
00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:05,130
Rang.

574
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:08,801
Ajussi.

575
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:14,673
He isn't ajussi.
He is your father.

576
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,078
Please save my father.

577
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:24,583
Rang.

578
00:56:25,684 --> 00:56:27,520
Why is she like that?

579
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,190
Has this child gone muddle-headed?

580
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:52,845
Rang, I can do it... Right?

581
00:57:24,043 --> 00:57:27,346
That fellow's name is 
really called Kkeok Jeong, right?

582
00:57:27,346 --> 00:57:31,016
Yes.
I found out that he's called Im Kkeok Jeong.

583
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:35,054
Im Kkeok Jeong that fellow has been caught 
by the Police Station a few times,

584
00:57:35,054 --> 00:57:37,990
but he can always escape unnoticed.

585
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:40,926
This is something I can look forward to.

586
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,230
As long as my intuition is correct,

587
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,166
he'll escape from here by tonight.

588
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:56,709
Isn't that Inspector Im?

589
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,012
<i>That's correct.</i>

590
00:57:58,012 --> 00:58:03,315
Inspector Im heard that you went 
to Lord Gim Chi Yong's residence,

591
00:58:03,315 --> 00:58:05,518
so he said he needed to go too.

592
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:06,986
Is that so?

593
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:09,555
<i>Sir.</i>

594
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:20,566
Secretly follow him. 
Absolutely do not be discovered.

595
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:22,034
Yes.

596
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:43,322
Kkeok Jeong!

597
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:45,891
I've come.

598
00:58:45,891 --> 00:58:50,296
What happened?
Who made you like this?

599
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:57,636
Lift up your head.

600
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:05,711
What I am going to ask you now,

601
00:59:06,078 --> 00:59:09,381
you must answer with the truth.

602
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,951
Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:15,988
How could I dare to lie to you?

604
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,025
The Crown Prince here...

605
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:30,302
did he really secretly hide treasonous 
criminal Choe Won at the Eastern Palace?

606
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:39,478
<i>In the future the position of 
Chief Eunuch will be yours.</i>

607
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:47,920
This concerns the fate of this country.
What are you doing, not quickly answering?

608
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,399
Quickly answer me.

609
01:00:01,867 --> 01:00:07,006
Your Majesty, I deserve death!

610
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:16,549
Aigoo, this... wait...

611
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,953
What is the 
Royal Investigation Bureau's Inspector doing here?

612
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:32,698
What is wrong with you?
We're all people who know the business.

613
01:00:33,432 --> 01:00:35,267
We have to leave.

614
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:40,773
Please put me to death, Your Majesty.

615
01:00:42,975 --> 01:00:44,443
In other words,

616
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:48,480
the Crown Prince really colluded 
with a treasonous criminal

617
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:51,417
and even brought him to the Eastern Palace?

618
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,885
Father.

619
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:55,454
Just sit still.

620
01:00:58,757 --> 01:01:00,226
Actually...

621
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:18,210
Let's separate first.

622
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:22,615
If this continues, all of us will be caught.

623
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:34,360
We'll meet up at the road 
to the entrance of Yangju.

624
01:01:36,195 --> 01:01:38,030
I'm relying on you.

625
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:39,498

Grand Prince, what conduct do you think 
the cornerstone of this country should have?

629
01:03:09,054 --> 01:03:11,257
The cornerstone of this country isn't me...

01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:24,103
He seems to have been caught.
