00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,003
Hi! I'm Raj!

3
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:07,133
People have always
called me a kid.

4
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,203
thatwas to suggest
that I was an orphan.

5
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,348
Itwas then Mrs. Godinho came into
my life and gave me her love.

6
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:17,586
Thatwas a signal that I was
no longer all alone in the world.

7
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:21,214
She taught me something very nice.

8
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:27,387
Do so much good to others
that they never lack goodness

9
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:30,156
Itwas Mrs. Godinho
who taught me music...

10
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:33,159
and she wanted me to become
a very big singer some day

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,038
When I grew up, I started
dreaming of someone

12
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,873
My dream-girl

13
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:43,236
this was a signal that there was
someone, who was made only for me

14
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,616
I can't explain why, but I think
Mumbai is the city...

15
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:52,245
where a career and
my dream-girl await me

16
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,389
You mustwonderwhat `signals'
I'm talking about

17
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,627
According to Mrs. Godinho, God always
gives us the right signals

18
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:01,187
And it is we who
can't see them

19
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,397
I've always been fond
of body-building

20
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,399
Which is why I've kept away
from cigarettes and alcohol

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,220
If there is something I ever drink,
it's a cup of hot tea

22
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,285
A cup of hot tea!

23
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:37,290
And my beloved to
make me drink it up

24
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:42,671
May she be dark of skin,
or fair

25
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:47,300
But someone who
will embrace me

26
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:54,683
I wish I could meet her;
and every sorrow would vanish

27
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:52,741
When I leave home every morning,
after giving her a kiss

28
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:57,746
And every moment I spend then
missing her

29
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:17,766
For her, I will live and die

30
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:22,771
What else have I to do?

31
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,404
There will be
happiness for me

32
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,409
But nothing will have
meaning without her

33
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,581
May she be fair of skin,
or even dark

34
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,795
But she will embrace me

35
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:53,802
Every sorrow would vanish,
if only I could have her

36
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:34,467
She'll open the door for me,
when I return every evening

37
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,472
She'll hug me tightly
and say she loves me

38
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:43,852
She come to me
all dressed up

39
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,857
And relieve me of
the stress of the day

40
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,866
She'll be different
from the others

41
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,495
She'll be my wife

42
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,901
A cup of hot tea

43
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,906
And my beloved
to make me drink it

44
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:43,536
May she be fair-skinned
or dark

45
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,916
But someone who
will care for me

46
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,923
All my worries would vanish,
if only I could have her

47
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,586
There it is!
The signal to go to Mumbai!

48
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:43,852
Raja!
- Aba!

49
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:48,857
Hurry up, buddy!

50
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,866
How are you?
- Delighted!

51
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,495
At last! You've got the green signal
to come to Mumbai!

52
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,901
Knowwhat Mrs. Godinho says?

53
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,906
In Mumbai, you will make
your life and find ittoo

54
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:43,536
Watch out! You're going to be
a superstar in a few days!

55
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,916
You'll find your dream-girl too!

56
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,923
So how's your uncle?
- Don't mention that name.

57
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:32,586
Why not?
- The bloody miser!

58
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,954
God had rather made me an orphan,
than give me an uncle like him!

59
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:23,165
I thought I'd put up
with you and your uncle.

60
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,818
He doesn't let me live with him.
Why would he allow you?

61
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:30,448
Really?
- Of course.

62
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:32,325
So what do you do for a living?
And where do you stay?

63
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,332
I work at my uncle's
fruit-juice shop, all right!

64
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,980
But I live in my own house.
- What?

65
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,649
Oh yes!
- Your own house?

66
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,845
A house in Mumbai!

67
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:59,227
Do you like it? Great, isn't it?
- What place is this, by the way?

68
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,003
Now look; I have nothing
that God has given me.

69
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,630
Whatever I have is what I got
from the Municipality!

70
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:12,381
It's a gift from
the city of Mumbai!

71
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:16,636
Priceless stuff, I must say.
- All stolen. Real hard work, I say.

72
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:19,305
And what do you call the place?
- My home.

73
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:23,017
It's better than
living on the pavements!

74
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,019
If it wasn't for the roof and the
walls, it's worse than the pavements!

75
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,022
You can't think of bathing
without water, can you?

76
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:33,778
So you mustn't
call your house names.

77
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,890
Life is difficult in this city.
You'll get to know very soon.

78
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,702
That I know.

79
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:45,273
This is the city where
I will find everything.

80
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:49,710
Now tell me; what should be
my first step in the city?

81
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,629
Simple. You must buy a bike.
- What has that to do with singing?

82
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,283
This is a city of pretenses.

83
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,287
Those with vehicles
take off before anyone else.

84
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:03,291
We'd need money for that.
- Sure, we would.

85
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,726
Let me open the Reserve Bank's locker.
- Hurry up.

86
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,296
Here you are! Count it!
- Not me. Do it yourself.

87
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:12,692
It's 500 bucks!
- How about the time deposit?

88
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:15,303
Here's another 500 Rupees!
That makes it a grand!

89
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:21,075
But how will we get a bike in 1000?
- We've just got to open an account.

90
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:23,937
The same old gag, you mean?
Damn it!

91
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:28,666
You have given me these
post-dated checks, thank you.

92
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,944
Now for the last formalities. Sign
the papers and take away the bike.

93
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:34,322
Go ahead, son.
Sign it.

94
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,339
What's biting someone?
- Not me.

95
00:15:56,612 --> 00:16:00,348
It's out there!

96
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:22,370
It's four guys against one!

97
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,012
Listen, son...
that isn't unusual.

98
00:16:54,878 --> 00:17:00,408
Guys who issue dud checks
get beaten up like that.

99
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,847
Those guys are from
the financing agency.

100
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,892
They have their own style
of recovering money.

101
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:54,462
Dangerous style!
- 35 checks out of 36 were honored.

102
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,232
But his last check bounced. Why?
- Such beating for one dud check?

103
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,360
Sure... but you needn't worry.

104
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,237
Why not?
- You guys come from good families.

105
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:06,474
Do we?!

106
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:10,478
Forget our checks.
We even carry cash that bounces!

107
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:14,482
He doesn't, he means.
- Right!

108
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,919
That's my pen!

109
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,254
That's not the way you sit?
- This is Mumbai.

110
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:23,925
You never know who does
what behind your back.

111
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:28,262
Get going.
I'll handle the rear end!

112
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:32,500
Hold it! Here's the studio!

113
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,269
The guard saluted us because
we arrived on a bike.

114
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,272
Orthey wouldn't care!

115
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:39,507
This is a very big studio.

116
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:45,513
There's no one here, ma'am...
- No meetings without an appointment!

117
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:50,952
Abdul! You're empty-handed!
No fruit-juice for me?

118
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,912
No juices. I bring a singertoday.
Raju. My friend from Goa.

119
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:56,958
What a singer!
... is Mr. Mishra in?

120
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:01,295
Please hold this blazer.
We'll go and see him.

121
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:05,299
Punk! I don't get to see the owner
in the ten years I do the rounds here!

122
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,161
And you guys justwalk in
and getto meet him!

123
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,306
Listen, bag of bones!
He'd blow you away with his breath!

124
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,308
No! Don't breathe...!
Go on inside!

125
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,545
What's your problem?
- They've gone in. So will l.

126
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:23,551
I won't let you in!
- I'll force my way in!

127
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,945
Whatwill you do in there?
- Well...? What will l?

128
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:27,947
Why was I here, mister?
- To ask for the whereabouts.

129
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:31,559
This address, right?
- Yes. Take Bus No. 80.

130
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:56,585
Get off at the last stop.
That's where your house is.

131
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,353
Thank you very much!
Bus No. 80...

132
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,591
Absent-minded man!
He forgets to sing once he's here...

133
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,595
and goes back home. It's been
happening for 10 years!

134
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:11,032
Mr. Mishra, that friend of mine I spoke
about is here. He's a great singer.

135
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,367
Give him a chance, sir.
It'd make his life.

136
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:17,038
Everyone who comes here
claims he's a great singer.

137
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,376
Does anyone say he can't sing?

138
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:27,616
When is Sonu Nigam arriving?
- Any moment now, sir.

139
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:32,386
The name is Raju. From Goa.
I want to be a singer.

140
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:36,390
Throw him out, guys!
- Relax... I want to be a singer.

141
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:39,628
Do you know, darling;
I'm in love with you

142
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:44,215
You know it, darling;
I'm in love with you

143
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,404
I'd do anything for you

144
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:53,199
What a singer!
You're fantastic!

145
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,409
You're a top singer!
Oh yes you are!

146
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,540
I'll be a singer, won't l?
- Will you?

147
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,084
Who made Udit Narayan what he is?
I did!

148
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:05,419
And who made Kumar Sanu's career?
I did!

149
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,656
And Mohammad Rafi...?
- Rafi, too?

150
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:12,426
No! He made my career!

151
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:15,555
Now quickly record your songs
and bring the cassette to me.

152
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:18,291
Isn't it the music companies
which records the songs, sir?

153
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,671
I'll explain this to you.

154
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:27,441
I've heard you sing.

155
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:30,570
But how's the boss of my company,
Mahesh Hirwani, going to do that?

156
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,447
I want your songs recorded
so he can listen to it.

157
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:35,684
How much will it cost us
to have the songs recorded?

158
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,288
Maybe a hundred thousand
or 150,000

159
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,316
150,000?!
- Maybe 200,000

160
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:50,699
200,000?!

161
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:54,468
You have the talent.
You're going to make money!

162
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:57,706
200,000 bucks! That isn't money
we can find in our pockets!

163
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:03,712
My careerwill be
finished for 200,000

164
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:07,481
We haven't money for 2 liters
of petrol. And he wants 200,000!

165
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:09,483
I can't push this anymore.
- Get your Uncle to pay for gas.

166
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:13,722
I'll go to him. He must be angry
I haven't still gone to the shop.

167
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:17,491
We'll buy gas with the money
I bring from him.

168
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:20,494
Who's made a shop out
ofthis bus shelter?

169
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:23,497
Hey mister... who's made
a shop out of that?

170
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,167
It's still a bus-shelter, mister.
A company's beautifying it.

171
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:29,170
Still a bus stop! Strange!
It looks like a shop!

172
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,741
That's a shop, Aba.
- It's a bus stop.

173
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:36,369
It's a shop!
- A bus stop!

174
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,180
Take a good look.
That's your uncle's new shop.

175
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,374
You look very happy.
Have you scored with a girl?

176
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,519
No, uncle.
- Why are you late, bloody dog!

177
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,756
I got held up, uncle!
Butwhy are you eating the remains?

178
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:54,763
Remains, eh? I'll tell you.

179
00:22:56,365 --> 00:23:00,393
This is a sweet-lime.
The juice in it is my principal.

180
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:05,774
Everything else in it
is my interest.

181
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,544
And you know, I never
let go of my interest!

182
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:12,405
You've earned so much in interest.
You must at least eat well, uncle.

183
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,786
God is kind. I eat the remains
of sweet-lime and orange.

184
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,789
I used to sell sugarcane juice
when I first came to Mumbai.

185
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:44,813
Fortwo years, I lived only
on the remains of sugarcane!

186
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:53,405
I'm glad, you didn't sell coconuts.
- Shut up!

187
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:55,824
You've turned up after lunch-hour.
You lose half your salary!

188
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:01,830
I have news, uncle. A friend of mine
from Goa is selling his shop.

189
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,534
What's the big deal? He isn't
giving it away forfree, is he?

190
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:25,497
It's as good as free, uncle!

191
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:45,934
How much would a 20 by 10 sq. feet
space sell for at Carter Road, Bandra?

192
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:49,938
For anything between
1.5 or 2 million.

193
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:54,568
He's giving it away
at 200,000!

194
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:57,946
At 200,000?

195
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,957
Butwhy's he giving it away
so cheap, my boy?

196
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:14,022
He lives in Goa. How'd he know
of the prices in Mumbai?

197
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:18,610
He's selling it at Goa's prices.
By Jove!

198
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,047
I'm going to buy that shop!
I'm going to buy it!

199
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:43,051
Where is this friend of yours?
- Out there... must I call him?

200
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:47,639
No! Don't call him in!
Let him remain there.

201
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:51,059
I'll get some unadulterated
juice for him.

202
00:27:57,332 --> 00:28:02,070
Go on... Hurry up, my boy!

203
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:10,078
The miser's fallen for it.
Do you want 20,00,000 instead?

204
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,081
Don't be greedy. We need 200,000.
And that's all we'll take.

205
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,670
This is Raju, uncle. And that's
my uncle. Notworthy of any praise.

206
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:46,114
Sit down...
and have some juice.

207
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:51,119
You're my nephew's friend,
after all.

208
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:54,889
My nephew told me that you're in
trouble and want to sell your shop.

209
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,685
Don'tworry. You will have no
problems till I'm around!

210
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:04,132
I'll buy that shop!

211
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:15,143
No sweat, uncle. There was this chap
here today. The deal's almost through.

212
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:20,148
But the deal hasn't been struck.
- No! We only got talking!

213
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:23,777
No deal yet.
- And why not?

214
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,920
He wanted to pay me by check. I want
cash because I'm leaving for Goa.

215
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:28,156
He wants it in cash, you see.
- I see!

216
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:37,165
You can never say with these guys!
You must always get paid in cash!

217
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:39,934
I'll pay it to you in cash.
Just you come with me! C'mon!

218
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:43,171
He really doesn't
deserve any praise!

219
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:55,183
Here's 200,000!

220
00:29:56,952 --> 00:30:01,189
200,000? Or is it
two watermelons?

221
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,316
Dangerous times, you know.
I've got to hide my dough!

222
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,820
I put back in the fruitwhat
I earn from it... open it!

223
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:16,329
My word, Uncle!
If only I knew...

224
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:22,210
I'll start my new shop tomorrow and
serve you the first fruit-juice!

225
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:31,219
It's made, uncle!
The shop's got made!

226
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:33,847
Why's he laughing so much?
- He's happy, you see.

227
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:36,224
He's going to Goa
and he's delighted.

228
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:41,855
Fantastic! You've got the dough!
We'll make a great cassette!

229
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:47,235
And you will be
the superstar!

230
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,240
This is the first time it has
happened in my 17 or 18 years

231
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,870
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime

232
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:59,805
There's someone...

233
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:02,375
There's someone I keep
thinking about all the time

234
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:05,879
I dream of her,
on silent nights

235
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:12,260
Lost I am,
in things I do not know

236
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,264
The breeze blows
the veil in the air

237
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:18,892
It sets my heart racing

238
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:24,830
Steady me, my friends

239
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:28,276
I seem to be losing myself

240
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,044
Caught up, I always am,
in these tresses

241
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:35,049
Footsteps awaken me

242
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,052
Why am I always
chasing memories?

243
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,288
My heart beats
in loneliness

244
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:44,725
I don't know
whom it pines for

245
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:48,688
Tell me, someone.
I want to know...

246
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:52,926
What's wrong with me?

247
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:57,889
Include my name too in the
list of the crazy lovers

248
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:04,104
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime

249
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:16,090
There is someone...

250
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,327
There is someone I keep
thinking about all the time

251
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:26,334
Hey! What's up with you?

252
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:33,466
Stop dreaming!
You are the real star.

253
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:38,346
He's only shaking his leg. And the
guys are going ga ga over the girls!

254
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,353
You're going to be a big star!
This cassette... it's worth 200,000.

255
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,355
Once the music company owners listens
to it... he's going to be fantastic!

256
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:51,359
Let Misra make you star.
I'll deal with my uncle later.

257
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,994
How are you...?
- Okay.

258
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:03,804
Why the long face? Where's Misra?
- Up there.

259
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:06,374
Up there? Have they
built another floor?

260
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,377
No. He's dead.

261
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:14,007
No, Misraji! You can't
leave me like this!

262
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:27,328
This was no age for him to die!

263
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:30,248
You wouldn't have died had
you waited for some more days!

264
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,167
I want to die!
Deliver me, O Lord!

265
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:37,171
Look! There's the owner of Music
Gramophone Company... Mahesh Hirwani!

266
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:39,966
Go and see if the
ambulance has arrived.

267
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,411
Get up... hurry!

268
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:48,416
It's okay... relax.

269
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:55,423
What's all this, Maheshji!
- He's dead... so what?

270
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:02,722
Do you know what he wanted most?
- Sure.

271
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,992
He wanted my company
to be at the forefront.

272
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:08,436
No?

273
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:13,441
All right. He wanted our company to
always find the money... right?

274
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:16,794
No!
- No? So what did he say?

275
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:18,697
What's he saying?

276
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:21,074
Mr. Mishra wanted him to be
a successful singer!

277
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:33,086
What?! These bloody
aspirants...

278
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:38,466
Take them away...

279
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:14,085
I wonder where these
guys land up from!

280
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:19,132
Take the madcap away!

281
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:26,139
Go on.

282
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:29,517
Weeping can make you tired.
- Sure.

283
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:36,524
Why are they noting our license number?
- Must be a no-parking zone.

284
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,152
Butwhen did the traffic cops
take to dressing like that?

285
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:42,530
They aren't the cops
brothers, are they?

286
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:49,162
No... I think they're
those thugs!

287
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:53,541
The first check we
issued has bounced!

288
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:57,979
Go on...
- I'll find a way.

289
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,107
What's the point in
eying the bike now?

290
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:04,318
What do you mean?
- The guy who owned it is dead.

291
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,554
What do you mean?
- He's dead. His body's lying inside.

292
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:09,557
We'd even get the corpse
to pay us, okay? C'mon guys!

293
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:14,562
Sit!

294
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:19,333
The moment I open my shop, the
customers make a beeline for it!

295
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,335
That's what you get when you
have a shop on a busy road!

296
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:24,338
Thanks a million, Lord!
Let the queues continue!

297
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:27,341
Where have they gone?

298
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:30,579
They must've taken my shop
for a bus-shelter!

299
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:32,205
It's an earthquake!

300
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:34,291
Help!

301
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,323
Everything's okay out there...
so why's my shop being shaken up?

302
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:09,826
Somebody stop them!
Police! Police!

303
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,839
What's happening here?
- Stop them, lnspector!

304
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:25,634
They've squeezed my shop!

305
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:30,764
Who asked you to start a shop
at a public bus shelter?

306
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,646
Is this a bus-shelter?!

307
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:33,702
No! It can't be true!

308
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,330
This is a railway station!
There'll be trains here soon!

309
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:45,338
Have you gone mad?
- Sure! I've gone mad!

310
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:48,341
I've gone mad...!
I've lost 200,000!

311
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,496
My stuff is all garbage!

312
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:05,166
Stop this guy! He's the
one who has robbed me!

313
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:09,362
Stop! Where do you think
you're going?!

314
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:13,742
Get down! Get down!

315
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,719
Inspector! Itwas this guy
who sold me that shop!

316
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,346
Look... your uncle.
There are cops too.

317
00:39:18,347 --> 00:39:20,373
Who sold the shop to you?
- Good God!

318
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,752
He's the one who sold it to me!

319
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,523
He's the one!
The bloody crook!

320
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:31,526
Get him, constables!

321
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,529
Go on, mister...
he's targeting everyone.

322
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,531
What the hell have I done...?

323
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:40,352
Forgive me...!

324
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:52,781
Get him, constables!
This guy's really gone mad!

325
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,411
It's my misfortune, Aba.

326
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:25,814
We've lost 200,000. And I haven't
even got to be a star.

327
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,711
Neither did I find my dream-girl
nor is my dream realized.

328
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:35,448
God keeps giving us those signals.
But we're fools not to notice them.

329
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:38,827
Take Misra's death,
for instance.

330
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,809
That is to suggest that I have
entered the wrong lane.

331
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,837
Mrs. Godinho's back there in Goa.
I think I'll go to her.

332
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,845
What? You have ruined my life.
And you'll go back to Mrs. Godinho?

333
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:59,848
Very well. You had to come along
and spoil things even more for me.

334
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,852
There's your signal...
so go to Goa!

335
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,442
You've been a great support, Aba.
- And that was a mistake?

336
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:15,488
I'll give you something
before I leave.

337
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:22,871
Whatwill you give me anyway?
- The bike's all yours.

338
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:29,878
The keys belong to you. And this
cassette is for your uncle.

339
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:41,473
Those thugs will beat me up
forthe bike...

340
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:43,892
and my uncle will beat me up
forthis bloody cassette!

341
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,661
Happy Diwali, fatso!
- What Diwali?!

342
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:49,664
He's only wishing you.
- I'm doomed, anyway!

343
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,666
Now either kill me.
Or I'm going to kill myself!

344
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,668
Right now!

345
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:55,028
Do you want to kill someone?

346
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:07,916
Look at this.

347
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:12,478
It's a bride.

348
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,689
The train's coming...
get out of the way!

349
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,550
Get the hell out of there!

350
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:20,929
Don't be crazy!
Leave the girl alone!

351
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:29,938
Get out, Raju!
The train's coming!

352
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:35,193
Thank God forthe car
which saved her life!

353
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:42,951
Take herto the operation theatre
and inform Dr. Chander. Quick!

354
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:47,513
Do you know her, sir?
- Of course.

355
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:50,959
Who brought her here?
- Her husband did.

356
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:57,966
I want you to check
this man's mental health.

357
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:07,559
He started a fruit-juice shop
at a bus shelter.

358
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,870
We want to know if he's really mad
orwhether he's faking it.

359
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:15,984
Why have you come in here?
Please go out.

360
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,612
This is an operation theatre.
- Take him away.

361
00:43:19,254 --> 00:43:22,757
No... I won't go out.

362
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:24,759
That's the lady's husband.

363
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,929
Please, doctor...
- Now look, son.

364
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,626
but you must go out.
- Please don't do that, doctor.

365
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:36,771
Nothing will happen to your wife.
- My wife...? Oh yes! My wife!

366
00:43:36,772 --> 00:43:41,009
She's lying there all-alone!
And I've never let her be lonely.

367
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:51,786
How can I leave her like this?

368
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:56,608
Please let me be here with her.
Quietly. In a corner.

369
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,585
The nurse's given me a sleeping pill.
- An injection. Not a pill.

370
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:04,465
May I sit down?

371
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:07,035
What's happened to my child?

372
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:09,470
What's wrong, dear?

373
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:12,807
On the day of a festival?

374
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:15,043
How's Pooja, K.D.?

375
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,296
What injuries has
she received?

376
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:20,674
No injuries as such.

377
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,485
She has suffered a head injury.
Back there... at the rear end.

378
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,488
Because of which she had
a brain hemorrhage.

379
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:30,825
Because of the force of the blood,
she's now in a coma.

380
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:33,494
We have conducted an operation to
lessen the pressure on her mind.

381
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:36,690
In medical terms, we call this
a state of coma vigil

382
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:40,068
Which means, she can hear, listen and
understand. But she can't speak.

383
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,070
Pooja will be all right,
won't she?

384
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:45,506
If only you had agreed to Pooja's
marriage with Romi, sir...

385
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:47,367
we wouldn't have had
to see this day.

386
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:53,665
But Pooja is already married!
- What?

387
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:02,857
She was brought here
in a bridal dress.

388
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:06,678
It was her husband
who saved her.

389
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:12,100
Romi...?
- Of course.

390
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,117
Where is he?

391
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:32,887
Romi has risked his own life
to save Pooja.

392
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:36,891
Did you... jump before a speeding
train to save Pooja's life?

393
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:39,894
I only did my duty.
- You have saved not Pooja alone...

394
00:45:39,895 --> 00:45:44,132
you have saved the
whole family, son.

395
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:48,903
Why only Pooja? I'd have done it
for anyone in her place.

396
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:55,143
I was wrong, son. We turned down the
match, without even meeting you.

397
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,580
We thought you weren't good enough
for Pooja and for ourfamily.

398
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:03,918
I have nothing to do with what you
thought and what you nowthink, sir.

399
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:06,154
That's because...
- How were we to know, son...?

400
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:10,925
that you'd be the angel
to come into our lives?

401
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:16,931
Thank a million, Lord, for
sending him into Pooja's life.

402
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:20,935
Now look, ma'am. I have nothing
to do with Pooja or you.

403
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:23,171
Just please forgive me.
And please let me go.

404
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:28,943
Don't say such things, son.
I realize I've made a mistake.

405
00:46:28,944 --> 00:46:33,948
That I should have
at least have met you!

406
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,950
I should have tried to understand you.
Please forgive me, son.

407
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:38,812
Please forgive me...
- Who are you folks?

408
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:44,192
Who on earth are all of you...?
Please let me go... please!

409
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,195
My boss is asking for pardon. You
mustn't leave Pooja in this state!

410
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:53,759
I seek your pardon, sir!
I have enough tensions in life.

411
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,971
I've got to sing... I mean, go!
...how am I going to explain?!

412
00:46:56,972 --> 00:47:00,975
Get this straight, my good man.
I must see Mr. Oberoi.

413
00:47:00,976 --> 00:47:03,978
Maybe. But he's in the lCU after
a heart attack. You can't see him.

414
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:07,106
Damn it! Is this a hospital
or is it a prison?

415
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:10,776
Now look; I'm not keeping well.
I'm going to get a heart attack.

416
00:47:10,777 --> 00:47:13,221
Let me meet him...
- Skip the drama!

417
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:16,850
Well, all right.
Here you are.

418
00:47:16,992 --> 00:47:19,994
You're trying to bribe me, are you?
I'm not going to let you in at all!

419
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:23,998
What a madcap!
Make him see reason!

420
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,000
What are you doing here?
Go to yourwife.

421
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:28,236
Look at him!

422
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:33,658
He barged into a funeral the
other day. And he's here today.

423
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,247
You let those two-penny guys in
and stop rich folks like me!

424
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,183
That chap is Mr. Bharat Oberoi's
son-in-law.

425
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:46,020
Maybe... what?!
- That's right.

426
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,256
Mr. Bharat Oberoi's son-in-law.
He's Pooja's husband.

427
00:47:52,528 --> 00:47:56,848
Pooja even has a husband...
the jerk!

428
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:00,894
Why am I always
the fall guy?

429
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:07,275
I'm not blaming you.

430
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:09,710
Butwhy me?

431
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:14,048
I'm leaving now. Tell yourfolks
that I'm not Romi.

432
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:18,286
That you metwith an accident and l
happened to be there to save you...

433
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:22,290
is a signal that you have
a long life ahead of you.

434
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:43,311
And make sure you
drive slowly in future.

435
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:51,319
What is it now?
- I've heard what you said to her.

436
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:02,096
Have you? Then you must know
I'm Raj. I'm not Romi.

437
00:49:02,097 --> 00:49:04,098
So go and tell them! Please!
- No! I can't tell them!

438
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:06,100
My boss has had a heart attack.
I can't tell him all that.

439
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:10,104
You don't think I'm a doctor, do you?
- You knowwhat state Pooja is in.

440
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:12,106
Should I tell him that you're not
Romi... I don't know what'll happen.

441
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:16,344
Please stay back! I have seen hope
in his eyes since you have arrived.

442
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:20,114
Who are you anyway?
And what makes you so interested?

443
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:22,116
I'm nothing more than an accountant.
But I've been with him for 30 years.

444
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:27,121
He has always treated me
like a brother.

445
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:29,123
I beg for his life...
Please don't go away.

446
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:32,293
He treats me like nothing, okay?
So I beg of you for my life...

447
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:35,614
I've taken enough in life anyway.
Give me a break. Please!

448
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:39,133
See?... now step aside.

449
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:43,137
Son-in-law! How are you?
- You, sir?

450
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:45,139
Don't embarrass me
by calling me sir!

451
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,375
Son-in-law?
- You're Pooja's husband.

452
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:54,315
Why didn't you tell me you're
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law?

453
00:49:54,316 --> 00:49:56,817
Fantastic! You are
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law!

454
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:58,778
What's fantastic about that?

455
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:03,016
It's indeed amazing,
son-in-law.

456
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:08,396
Honestly, when I saw you weeping
at Misra's funeral the other day...

457
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:11,165
I knew for sure that
it was a son-in-law...

458
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:14,168
that you have the
Goddess's blessings.

459
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:16,170
What a melodious way
of crying! Indeed!

460
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:18,406
I've yet to see a son-in-law cry,
errr... sing, like you!

461
00:50:18,674 --> 00:50:22,035
You are undoubtedly the
son-in-law No. 1!

462
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:27,181
And what happens to this cassette?
- To hell with this one!

463
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:30,810
I'll have a fresh one recorded
for you... just you see!

464
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:35,048
I'll give it a release so grand
that no son-in-law...

465
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,425
...I mean, no singer
has ever had!

466
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:40,428
So just drop in
at my office tomorrow.

467
00:50:40,696 --> 00:50:46,200
The son-in-law...
my Statue of Liberty!

468
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:51,205
Find Romi quickly, Goverdhan.
Brother's been asking for him.

469
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:53,207
Go ahead. I'll find him.

470
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,209
Romi ought to be with my brother.
That's what the doctor says.

471
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,447
So bring him quickly.

472
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:04,218
God Almighty... where will
I bring him from?

473
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:07,455
And whatwill I tell them?

474
00:51:08,015 --> 00:51:10,083
Stop crying... Romi's here.

475
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:18,466
Really?
- Yes.

476
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:21,720
I thoughtthat if playing Romi
could save Bharatbhai's life...

477
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:24,864
so why not? Saving a life
is anyway a noble deed.

478
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:27,241
You're a great boy...
Let's go. He's asking for you.

479
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:30,103
Open your eyes, Bharat...
Iook who's here.

480
00:51:30,746 --> 00:51:33,247
I will hold something against you.
Why wasn't I born as your son?

481
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:35,483
Open Sesame!
- Hey! This is her bag.

482
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,044
Correction. It was hers.
It now belongs to us.

483
00:51:38,045 --> 00:51:41,255
Look! Jewellery worth
half a million.

484
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:45,493
A laptop. The stuff's
worth over a million!

485
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:50,123
My life is made, Raju!

486
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:58,506
I'm shedding tears of joy!
- Don't cry. I'll return the bag.

487
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:08,516
Return it?! Whateverfor?
- To steal is a sin, Aba.

488
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:11,285
I see! A sin, eh?

489
00:52:11,286 --> 00:52:17,108
We conned my uncle into buying a bus
shelter as a shop. Wasn't that a sin?

490
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:21,112
We did that for my career.
- I see.

491
00:52:22,047 --> 00:52:24,532
Wasn't it a sin to issue a check
for 30,000 when you had just 1000?

492
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,302
Thatwas to further my career.
- Oh great! For your career!

493
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:31,097
And now that I land some dough,
it's all wrong!

494
00:52:31,098 --> 00:52:34,167
Now look; I did every wrong only
for my career. And I've got my break.

495
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:38,312
Who's giving it to you?
- Know whose daughter she is?

496
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:40,314
She's the daughter
of Bharat Oberoi!

497
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:43,176
And Mahesh Hirwani...?
- What's up?

498
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:46,529
Is he dead?
- He's giving me the break!

499
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,557
I see. He's going to die soon.

500
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:54,562
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?

501
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:05,339
We meet God at every step in life;
it's just that we don't recognize him.

502
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,578
Have you ever been
drenched in the rains?

503
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:16,585
Sure. On many occasions.
- Has anyone offered you an umbrella?

504
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:21,464
Sure.
- You didn't recognize him

505
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:27,053
I did. It was Babban!
- It wasn't Babban...

506
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:30,198
It was God!
- God? Babban?

507
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:32,475
Have you ever lay there,
without anything to eat?

508
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:37,063
It's happened so many times.
- Did someone come and feed you?

509
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:40,208
Sure. The milkmaid did.
- It wasn't the milkmaid.

510
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:44,487
That was God, too.

511
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:48,491
I met God last night too.

512
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:51,219
And God gave me a break.
- I see! God has given you the break!

513
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,497
How could I forget to tell you?
I met God last night too.

514
00:53:58,393 --> 00:54:03,231
Who?
- The one who gave you the break...

515
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:05,508
and gave me this bag!
- Hold it!

516
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:09,512
I'm going to return that bag!
- You can't take away what God gives!

517
00:54:10,155 --> 00:54:12,865
God hasn't given you that bag, Aba.
You've stolen it from him.

518
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:15,101
And it's a sin to steal from God.
Give that to me, Aba.

519
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:18,246
Take it!

520
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,249
No! Not anymore, please!

521
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:26,529
How are you?
- I'm okay, no thank you.

522
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:29,257
How many fingers are these?
- Five, thank you!

523
00:54:29,258 --> 00:54:32,426
And who am l?
- The lnspector!

524
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:35,538
Where are you, at the moment?
- In a hospital, no thank you!

525
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:39,267
Was that a bus-stop or was it
a fruit-juice stall?

526
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:42,545
It was a bloody bus stop!

527
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:46,549
Looks like he's all right, doctor.

528
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:49,902
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished!

529
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:52,947
What will you eat?
- Remains of all the fruits!

530
00:54:52,948 --> 00:54:56,142
Give him some more shock, doctor.
He isn't all right.

531
00:54:57,786 --> 00:55:00,288
No worry. That's the mental ward.
Such noises are commonplace.

532
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:02,290
It's day already... wake up.

533
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,569
Here's your bag.
It was with my friend.

534
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:08,154
You'll find everything intact. Except
5000 Rupees, which my friend has spent.

535
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:12,576
But I'll return the money as soon
as you regain consciousness.

536
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:15,011
I had told you that I would
never meet you again.

537
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:20,975
But Mr. Goverdhan has requested me
to stay back...

538
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:25,021
and play Romi till your
dad gets well.

539
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,481
I have my interests at heart too.
I'm a singer, you know?

540
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:31,595
Mahesh Hirwani is going to
release an album of mine...

541
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,990
because he thinks
I'm your husband.

542
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:37,950
My life is made!

543
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,827
Someday I will recite
a song for you.

544
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:42,330
Why someday? Let me recite it
for you right now.

545
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:45,609
You must give me a big hand
if you like the song, okay?

546
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:49,170
Itwill laugh;
itwill cry

547
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:52,198
Itwill find someone;
and itwill lose someone

548
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:56,010
In solitude, itwill suffer

549
00:55:56,011 --> 00:56:00,624
That's every heart in love

550
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,352
Come, Romi... they're asking for you.

551
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:07,631
Has Mr. Goverdhan arrived?
- Not yet. But come on.

552
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:13,219
They want to ask you something.

553
00:56:14,863 --> 00:56:18,642
What? What do they want to ask?
- Why are you scared?

554
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,645
I'll come after
Mr. Goverdhan arrives.

555
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,372
Of course he will arrive.
Now come on... C'mon!

556
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:26,650
How can I believe that
you are Romi?

557
00:56:27,376 --> 00:56:30,044
Give it a thought.

558
00:56:30,045 --> 00:56:32,380
When the accident occurred,
Pooja was at the wheels and you...

559
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:35,659
That's Monty from America.
He's my sister-in-law's son.

560
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:39,246
And this is Romi.

561
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:44,918
I can't believe he's Romi.

562
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:51,399
Any proof?
- I am the proof.

563
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,902
I know he's Romi.

564
00:56:54,903 --> 00:56:58,406
Pooja had once introduced
me to him.

565
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:00,684
Really? When was that?
- Actually, when Pooja and l...

566
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,413
went to buy a computer for her,
we had lunch together. Right?

567
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:08,275
You have spoilt her
with your indulgence.

568
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:12,086
You kept her secretwithout
telling us anything.

569
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:14,922
I thought I'd tell you
when the time came.

570
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:17,758
When are we doing the recording, sir?
- We're doing it, son-in-law...

571
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:20,954
it'll be done in good time.
Just don't worry!

572
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:24,708
Don't mention his name as
son-in-law on the album.

573
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,717
He's kidding!

574
00:58:05,974 --> 00:58:08,752
The album will have it
in bold print: Romi!

575
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:11,755
Not Romi. It oughtto be Raj.
- Raj?

576
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,758
Your name is Romi!
- Right.

577
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:20,488
Butthe album will say Raj.
- Why?

578
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:24,351
Why did Yusuf Khan choose
to call himself Dilip Kumar?

579
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,194
Because thatwas a
lucky name for him.

580
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:39,674
I see!
So Raj is a lucky name for you!

581
00:58:39,675 --> 00:58:42,786
So we'll call you Raj.
What's the big deal?

582
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:46,790
When are we doing the recording?
- We're busy this year.

583
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,517
But I promise. Yours will be the
first album next year.

584
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:51,519
A year? Impossible!

585
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,522
I had told you, Raj. HMV promises
to release the album in 3 months.

586
00:58:54,523 --> 00:58:57,191
And what did Polygram say?
- 15 days, they promised.

587
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:59,177
So let's go!
- Hold it, guys

588
00:58:59,194 --> 00:59:02,530
You guys getworked up
for nothing!

589
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:06,810
Wow! You're into Moonwalking!
You're a born star!

590
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:10,814
Sit down... Go on.
- What for?

591
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,819
It'll require at least 8 days to...
- 8 days!

592
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:20,715
That's a very long time.
- Be reasonable, guys.

593
00:59:20,716 --> 00:59:26,830
You know what a busy music composer
Anu Malik is, don't you?

594
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,832
He's away in Europe.
You must wait for him to return.

595
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:32,836
Besides, Pooja's in hospital.
Would it be okay...

596
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:36,840
to record itwithout her?
- It's Pooja I'm doing all this for.

597
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:39,567
Pooja will spring to herfeet,
the moment she listens to my song.

598
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:42,429
Mr. Goverdhan!
- Congratulations!

599
00:59:44,865 --> 00:59:48,435
All ourtensions are over!
- They're over!

600
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:54,858
We have no problems in future!
- No problems!

601
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:59,863
Let's go and tell
Bharatbhai the truth!

602
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:04,451
Here's where the problem lies.
I won't tell Bharatbhai the truth.

603
01:00:06,094 --> 01:00:09,873
Why not?
- I don'twant to!

604
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:12,600
Like you didn'twant it earlier.
- You have evil on your mind.

605
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:14,602
No matter what. I won't tell him!
- I'll go and tell him then.

606
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:16,880
So I'll tell him!

607
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:21,885
I'll go and tell him the truth!
- I'll tell him too...

608
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:28,115
aboutthe conspiracy you had hatched!
- What plan?

609
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:32,896
Whose plan?
- Have you forgotten what you told me?

610
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:35,790
The old man has millions!
He'll die of a heart attack.

611
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:38,292
That you'd strangle the girl and
we'd split the millions between us!

612
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:40,628
What rubbish...
are you talking!

613
01:00:40,629 --> 01:00:43,907
I could never imagine you'd
be such a cheapskate!

614
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,949
I'm not a cheapskate!
You're compelling me to be one!

615
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:31,538
Go out... I've got to make her change.
- Okay, we're going out.

616
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:36,960
Not him. He's her husband.
He'll help me.

617
01:01:39,146 --> 01:01:43,216
Go on... please.
- Listen to me!

618
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:49,222
Please pull that sheet.

619
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:59,983
She has...

620
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:05,405
She has a mole there!
- God!

621
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:16,349
Disgusting! Bloody disgusting!

622
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:21,254
I've never seen such a husband.
He shut his eyes...

623
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:19,312
when I asked him to change his
wife's clothes and grabbed my skirt!

624
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:24,651
You're an amazing man!

625
01:03:25,085 --> 01:03:27,320
You aren't as rotten
as I thought you were.

626
01:03:27,588 --> 01:03:30,323
And you're a much better man
than I thought you to be.

627
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:35,078
You know Mahesh Hirwani, don't you?

628
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:41,084
Sure. I do know him.
What is it about?

629
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:29,023
He thinks I'm really
Bharatbhai's son-in-law.

630
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:34,137
How many fingers on my hand?
- Five fingers, thank you!

631
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:39,142
Who am l?
- The lnspector, no thank you!

632
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,731
And who's that?
- The doctor!

633
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:50,737
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished, I swear!

634
01:05:56,445 --> 01:05:59,222
And what will you eat?
- Rice and lentil-curry. Anything!

635
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,476
Very good! He seems to be
all right now, doctor.

636
01:06:26,475 --> 01:06:28,335
Now tell me; why did you start a
fruit-juice stall at a bus stop?

637
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:43,266
There was this scoundrel who claimed
to own it and sold it to me!

638
01:06:46,161 --> 01:06:48,855
How much did you buy it for?
- 200,000!

639
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:53,276
Whom did you buy it from?

640
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:58,281
Speak up... whom did
you buy it from?

641
01:06:58,507 --> 01:07:02,009
Itwas that scoundrel
I bought it from!

642
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,287
Itwas that scoundrel!

643
01:07:08,517 --> 01:07:11,143
He isn't all right, doctor!
Give him the shock!

644
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:15,298
Once the recording is over,
I'll tell them that I'm not Romi.

645
01:07:15,566 --> 01:07:17,509
Know something? Whatwould God lose
if you were the real Romi?

646
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,699
Are you coming or going?
I've been looking for you.

647
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,310
Mr. Goverdhan! It's you
he's talking to!

648
01:07:27,536 --> 01:07:29,620
I couldn't tell whether he was
talking on the phone or addressing me.

649
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:32,206
I have news for you.
There was a call from Jahnvi.

650
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,901
Really...? That's my
daughter who called.

651
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:38,713
What did she say?
- She's returning to lndia tomorrow.

652
01:07:38,714 --> 01:07:41,908
I want some important medicine from
the U.S. Could Jahnvi bring it?

653
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:47,914
You ought to be happy
your daughter is returning.

654
01:07:48,557 --> 01:07:51,851
Jahnvi and Pooja keep no secrets.
She must surely know about Romi too.

655
01:07:51,852 --> 01:07:54,337
Jahnvi and Pooja are
more like sisters.

656
01:07:54,563 --> 01:07:56,923
Even at home, no one has ever
discriminated between them.

657
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:02,345
They've grown up together.

658
01:08:03,572 --> 01:08:05,932
Should Pooja have something,
Jahnvi too got it.

659
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:13,940
Whenever the bangles tinkle...

660
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:18,361
Whenever the anklets tinkle...

661
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:52,395
Whenever it pours...

662
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:54,981
My heart calls out

663
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,985
My love, O my beloved

664
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:03,406
Day in and day out,
my heart calls out...

665
01:09:04,132 --> 01:09:06,409
My love, O my beloved

666
01:09:06,635 --> 01:09:08,411
Why is there a pounding in my heart?
Why does it pine so?

667
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,414
What have you done to my heart,
O heartless one?

668
01:09:27,155 --> 01:09:30,016
My sleep vanishes;
I'm restless

669
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:33,828
The things that loneliness
does to me

670
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:37,164
My face is flushed
of its color

671
01:09:37,165 --> 01:09:42,445
I lower my eyes
out of shyness

672
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:44,130
I feel shy, even when
I look at the mirror

673
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:46,032
Why have you made me pine...?
Why have you taken away my peace?

674
01:09:46,675 --> 01:09:51,846
Whenever a boy meets a girl...

675
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:55,308
it awakens a desire
in my heart

676
01:09:55,309 --> 01:09:58,712
When the bridal cymbals
are played somewhere

677
01:09:59,188 --> 01:10:02,465
Whenever they deck up
the bridal palanquin...

678
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,468
I go crazy at heart
and yell out

679
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:13,476
Please come with me. I have
something to discuss with you.

680
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:16,479
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, father.

681
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:19,482
Can't you see where you're going?

682
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:22,210
That's Jahnvi... my daughter.

683
01:10:22,211 --> 01:10:24,212
Why does it always happen to me?
- What happened?

684
01:10:24,213 --> 01:10:26,489
Nothing really... I thought
I'd run away from here.

685
01:10:32,012 --> 01:10:35,498
And I ran into my life...
must I run away now? Or mustn't l?

686
01:10:42,022 --> 01:10:49,512
No need to run away!
Jahnvi has never met Romi!

687
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:52,098
She only spoke to him
over the phone.

688
01:10:53,742 --> 01:10:58,521
Care for some tea?
- No thank you.

689
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:05,528
No... don't cry, Biji.
You mustn't cry.

690
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:09,115
Make her see reason, dad...

691
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:12,118
We ought to be happy that
Pooja's life was saved.

692
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:20,543
We were saved before something
drastic could happen.

693
01:11:20,769 --> 01:11:25,548
And what's so seriously
wrong anyway?

694
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:29,552
I spoke to the doctor
before I arrived.

695
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,140
Know something? This is exactly
what happened to Superman, too.

696
01:11:34,283 --> 01:11:36,559
Yes! And he's back to his
flying ways already.

697
01:11:38,453 --> 01:11:41,080
All Pooja now has to do
is to simply get up.

698
01:11:41,081 --> 01:11:43,566
We've taken enough of
your drama, okay?

699
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:47,654
Remember? You had planned a dance
competition for us, on my return?

700
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:52,576
You were supposed to do an lndian
dance and I'd perform a Western.

701
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:56,470
I've even learnt new steps!

702
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:59,583
All right... now tell me
how's your married life?

703
01:11:59,808 --> 01:12:02,977
I've penned a couplet.
Want to hear it?

704
01:12:02,978 --> 01:12:06,506
I've filled up tubs with
my tears, as I remember you

705
01:12:06,815 --> 01:12:10,176
The uncouth man that you are;
you simply bathe in it!

706
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:13,680
What happened, dear?
- I ran into a madman out there.

707
01:12:13,822 --> 01:12:16,600
I went to wash the cold-drink
he spilt on me.

708
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:20,186
You washed itwith
yourtears, did you?

709
01:12:20,829 --> 01:12:24,123
God protect your
friendship with her.

710
01:12:24,124 --> 01:12:27,611
Come, Jahnvi.
Let me introduce you to Romi.

711
01:12:28,337 --> 01:12:31,005
That's Romi.

712
01:12:31,006 --> 01:12:34,200
This is Jahnvi.

713
01:12:36,845 --> 01:12:39,514
And you said she hadn't
ever met Romi!

714
01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:42,350
That's what I thought. That she had
only spoken to him overthe telephone.

715
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:46,103
Have you seen Romi?
- No.

716
01:12:46,104 --> 01:12:48,356
Pooja told me that he was short,
had brown eyes and curly hair.

717
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:50,216
But this chap...

718
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:55,363
In that case, you're
not Jahnvi either.

719
01:12:55,364 --> 01:13:00,368
Pooja told me that Jahnvi's
fat and ugly...

720
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:03,647
that she's squint-eyed
and has a bucktooth.

721
01:13:04,873 --> 01:13:08,652
But all that is not true.
You're very beautiful.

722
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,654
Getwell, Pooja.
And I'll fix you!

723
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,659
Tell him, Biji.

724
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:18,553
It's Diwali today.
We won't be celebrating it...

725
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:21,665
butwe must have a prayer.

726
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:26,670
We have to adhere
to our customs.

727
01:13:26,895 --> 01:13:29,673
So come over to our place
this evening.

728
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:35,403
Okay?
- Certainly.

729
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:38,682
It's your place too, son.

730
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:56,424
Glory be to the Goddess of Wealth

731
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:59,703
The Gods too pay
obeisance to You

732
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:07,435
Glory be to Thee

733
01:14:07,436 --> 01:14:10,229
My husband got this bungalow built
when my son was just 15 years old.

734
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:13,717
The prasad.
- You look beautiful.

735
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:20,724
Knowwhat Mrs. Godinho says?

736
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:31,044
It's fun to celebrate
Diwali with yourfamily.

737
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:34,689
Take some prasad?
- It has 150 calories!

738
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:39,193
I can't eat that!
- Go on. It's in the name of God.

739
01:15:39,194 --> 01:15:42,530
All right. I'll try some.

740
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:44,532
You're calorie-conscious,
aren't you?

741
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:48,536
No wonder you have
such a great figure.

742
01:15:48,537 --> 01:15:50,538
Happy Diwali everybody!

743
01:15:50,539 --> 01:15:53,400
Please give me a smile!

744
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:55,819
Welcome, Master. Let me introduce
you to my son-in-law.

745
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:58,546
Your son-in-law?
- Yes. He's Pooja's husband, Romi.

746
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:00,407
I've met him.
- Forget it.

747
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:37,861
I have forgotten it.
Please remind me where.

748
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:42,256
He's a singer. He's training
Pooja in classical dance.

749
01:16:42,257 --> 01:16:45,593
But he has this characteristic...
he's very absent-minded.

750
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:47,762
So tell me where we have met
lt'll refresh my memory.

751
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:49,263
Must l? In everybody's presence?
- Sure! Go ahead.

752
01:16:49,264 --> 01:16:51,432
The Master and I participated
in a dance-contest.

753
01:16:51,433 --> 01:16:52,792
He danced so well that
he dropped his pants.

754
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:55,879
Did that really happen?
- Yes... have you forgotten it?

755
01:16:56,104 --> 01:16:57,964
But you mustn't forget that
he's Pooja's husband, Romi.

756
01:16:58,106 --> 01:17:00,467
May I show Romi Pooja's room, dad?
- Certainly.

757
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:06,890
Why just the room?
The house belongs to him... go on.

758
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:12,896
This is Pooja's room.
- It's nice.

759
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,899
And where's your room?
- This is the one.

760
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:20,419
And which is Pooja's room?
- This is our room.

761
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,657
Didn't Pooja tell you
that we share the room?

762
01:17:26,635 --> 01:17:29,637
She did. And I forgot.

763
01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:31,498
So many perfumes... but why have
two of each?

764
01:17:34,142 --> 01:17:37,504
That's because Pooja likes
whatever I like...

765
01:17:37,646 --> 01:17:41,841
and I also take a liking to
whatever Pooja approves of.

766
01:17:43,318 --> 01:17:46,513
Look at this... we even have
the same kind of cell-phones.

767
01:17:47,155 --> 01:17:52,519
Aren't they nice?

768
01:17:53,412 --> 01:17:57,190
But what happens if the two of you
fall for the same guy?

769
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,668
That's impossible.
- Why?

770
01:18:00,669 --> 01:18:05,532
Because Pooja has already
approved of you, Romiji.

771
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:18,545
Don't you approve of me then?
- Well, I do.

772
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:21,965
But not in the same way.
- In what way, then?

773
01:18:24,818 --> 01:18:26,970
Pooja told me that
you're good at poetry.

774
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:31,975
So tell me the first couplet
you recited for Pooja.

775
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:38,565
Everyone I come across...

776
01:18:38,624 --> 01:18:41,985
appears to be like you

777
01:18:43,212 --> 01:18:45,989
Looks like I'm going
to go mad...

778
01:18:46,215 --> 01:18:48,575
for, I'm in love with you...

779
01:18:48,717 --> 01:18:50,718
I wait for you

780
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,720
No wonder Pooja loves you
so much, Romi ji.

781
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:55,515
What the hell are you doing?!

782
01:18:55,516 --> 01:18:58,001
I didn't know your preferences
had changed so much in six years!

783
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:00,561
Oh come on! I'm pretty hung up myself.
It's her I see every place.

784
01:19:00,562 --> 01:19:05,008
I find her in you, too.
- Really?... happens, I guess.

785
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:09,012
Does it really?
- Of course.

786
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:17,604
Lovers are like alcoholics.
They imagine the bottle everywhere.

787
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:22,025
But spare me and
let me go to sleep.

788
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:25,586
I was dreaming about the milkmaid.

789
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:29,757
Know what...?

790
01:19:29,758 --> 01:19:33,036
Will we only dream about girls?

791
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,957
Get up.

792
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:46,738
What's up with you?

793
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:49,141
I've got your address
with great difficulty.

794
01:19:53,213 --> 01:19:56,616
What's so difficult?
This is an easy place to find.

795
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:59,719
What would you like to drink?
Let me get something.

796
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,997
Aba! Get up!
- Who's that?

797
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:05,625
Me... Jahnvi's here.
How about some juices?

798
01:20:19,573 --> 01:20:22,601
Sorry! No juices!

799
01:20:48,268 --> 01:20:51,604
That's my friend, Aba.

800
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:54,049
Greetings!

801
01:20:55,776 --> 01:20:57,052
And good-bye!
- Good-bye!

802
01:20:57,277 --> 01:20:59,679
Dad says you have fulfilled
his desire for a son.

803
01:21:08,288 --> 01:21:13,068
He has sent you this little gift.
- Oh yes. Small guitar indeed.

804
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:17,463
What's in the guitar anyway?
- The car-keys.

805
01:21:17,464 --> 01:21:20,133
What car is it?
- An Opel. It's out there.

806
01:21:20,134 --> 01:21:24,079
Why's it out there?
- Because it can't be brought in.

807
01:21:25,305 --> 01:21:28,808
Dad has had the left-wing of
the bungalow vacated for you.

808
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:32,087
You will live with us.

809
01:21:35,816 --> 01:21:39,094
He has given me status
with all this respect.

810
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:41,721
On the other hand, he belittles me
by asking me to live with them.

811
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,357
Thank Dad on my behalf.

812
01:22:33,373 --> 01:22:35,708
All I want is love. Your love.
And love from everyone else.

813
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:39,154
Because there is nothing I can
give you, except for my love.

814
01:22:42,382 --> 01:22:44,784
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?

815
01:22:48,388 --> 01:22:51,166
Those who possess love are
never to be considered poor.

816
01:22:51,892 --> 01:22:56,562
How about some tea
and buns?

817
01:22:56,563 --> 01:22:58,798
Abdul! At least send for
some tea and buns!

818
01:23:06,406 --> 01:23:09,809
Looks like you've won again.

819
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:17,192
I've won again!

820
01:23:18,418 --> 01:23:21,446
Maybe you're lucky at both.

821
01:23:21,755 --> 01:23:24,783
Maybe you're beloved is very much
with you... and you don't know it.

822
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:27,760
I don't understand.
- Let me explain.

823
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:32,207
As Mrs. Godinho always says...

824
01:23:35,936 --> 01:23:39,798
God shows us the signal
at every place...

825
01:23:41,942 --> 01:23:43,776
but it is we who
can't understand.

826
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:49,224
We meet so many people
in our lifetime.

827
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:53,311
But then, we come across
an individual...

828
01:23:53,454 --> 01:23:55,856
whom we feel like meeting
time and again.

829
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:06,241
We are happy in his company.

830
01:24:07,468 --> 01:24:09,870
We are sad, when he goes away.

831
01:24:10,471 --> 01:24:12,873
That's the signal then.
One of us will have to leave...

832
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:20,255
The two of you will leave.
I will stay back here. Okay?

833
01:24:21,148 --> 01:24:23,884
Let Romi stay back, father.
- No, dear. He's tired.

834
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:30,265
He's tired... Go on.
- You ought to relax, sir.

835
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:32,893
The two of us will spend
the night chatting away.

836
01:24:34,995 --> 01:24:37,272
Only one person is permitted
to stay here. Just one.

837
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,277
Drop her home then, okay?
Go on, dear.

838
01:24:43,504 --> 01:24:47,866
That's even better...

839
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:53,288
I haven't brought my car...
will you give me a ride?

840
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:58,919
I certainly would, had the
elevator been working.

841
01:25:02,523 --> 01:25:05,300
Will a bike do?
- The bike, yes.

842
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:52,931
They seem to be
mopping the floor.

843
01:25:53,740 --> 01:26:01,356
You mustn't fall while
you try to steady me.

844
01:26:02,082 --> 01:26:08,363
You've fallen down!
- To steady you.

845
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:16,371
What?
- You need to fall to steady yourself

846
01:26:35,115 --> 01:26:37,784
Shall we go?

847
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:41,021
That's not the way.
We'll fall again.

848
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,398
It's fun to be with you.

849
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:50,405
We're going to be together for life.
- Now tell me something.

850
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:54,409
You took Pooja to the
Goddess's temple, didn't you?

851
01:26:54,635 --> 01:26:58,846
Don't even talk about that temple!
I've forgotten where it is!

852
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:03,043
And I wondered whether...
- What?

853
01:27:03,644 --> 01:27:07,422
I was wondering if you could take me
to the temple in the morning...?

854
01:27:07,648 --> 01:27:11,051
As Mrs. Godinho always says,
Never mess with the Gods

855
01:27:13,654 --> 01:27:20,435
You have opened my eyes!

856
01:27:21,995 --> 01:27:28,443
Why's she so formal with me?!

857
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:36,451
Is this any time to return?

858
01:27:52,693 --> 01:27:57,055
Excuse me! Who are you
to question me?

859
01:27:57,197 --> 01:28:00,100
I see the interest
Romi's showing in you.

860
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:14,072
What for?
- We're going to the temple.

861
01:28:14,214 --> 01:28:18,493
Know something, Monty?
The temple isn't meant for devils.

862
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,497
So why's Romi going there?

863
01:28:22,723 --> 01:28:26,501
Come on...

864
01:28:26,727 --> 01:28:30,505
How much time will it take?
Another 15 or 20 minutes?

865
01:28:32,733 --> 01:28:40,515
Ifwe walk fast like this,
we'll make it in 15 minutes.

866
01:29:13,774 --> 01:29:15,550
At this rate...
we'll take 20 minutes.

867
01:29:16,777 --> 01:29:19,179
Ifwe walk as slowly as this,
it'll take us 25 minutes.

868
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:33,568
30 minutes in slow motion and we won't
reach there ifwe don'twalk at all!

869
01:29:33,794 --> 01:29:37,572
Why do I get the feeling that there's
something you wish to say to me?

870
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:41,576
Howwill I tell her?!

871
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:46,139
Pooja and you are so very alike.
That's justwhat she said to me.

872
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,502
Why do I feel there's something
you wish to say to me...?

873
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:59,594
And what did you say
to herthen?

874
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:07,602
I said...
I love you

875
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:33,313
I cannot live without you

876
01:31:33,914 --> 01:31:36,316
You're very much in love,
aren't you?

877
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,084
Pooja's very lucky
to have found you.

878
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:40,320
You're luckierthan
Pooja is!

879
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:47,702
You will meet someone like me,
who will love you very much.

880
01:31:47,928 --> 01:31:49,955
You want that, don't you?

881
01:31:50,931 --> 01:31:59,714
Well, Romiji...

882
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,276
How many more questions to go?
- This last.

883
01:32:03,277 --> 01:32:06,012
How do find it without Pooja?

884
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,282
Great!

885
01:32:09,283 --> 01:32:12,018
You mean my heart?

886
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:16,456
Howwill I tell you
about what I feel?

887
01:32:16,457 --> 01:32:19,125
Everyone I meet
appears to be like you

888
01:32:19,126 --> 01:32:21,653
Everyone I meet
appears to be like you

889
01:32:21,962 --> 01:32:25,740
Looks like I'm going to go mad...

890
01:32:25,966 --> 01:32:29,744
in love with you;
while I wait for you

891
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:43,341
I've realized it after meeting you.
- What is it?

892
01:32:43,984 --> 01:32:46,386
Love is a strange feeling
where one forgets oneself.

893
01:32:47,988 --> 01:32:50,390
Why does it happen?

894
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:55,020
This is where the limits
to craziness begin

895
01:32:55,329 --> 01:32:57,355
It's your face I see
in every other face

896
01:33:02,503 --> 01:33:05,780
How will I even think
of anything but you...?

897
01:33:06,423 --> 01:33:08,366
It's you who clouds
my mind

898
01:33:28,028 --> 01:33:33,032
This is one helplessness
I have never known

899
01:33:33,033 --> 01:33:35,060
It's true.
Believe me, my love

900
01:34:16,076 --> 01:34:17,853
I should know what it means
to be lonely

901
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:26,444
I'm going to go mad;
I think so certainly

902
01:34:26,753 --> 01:34:28,488
I'm in love with you;
I await you

903
01:34:43,645 --> 01:34:45,338
What's okay? No one is.
Not she. Not you. Not I

904
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:51,803
I don't think anything's okay

905
01:34:56,325 --> 01:34:58,018
Love is a high
you can never be free of

906
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:02,022
It's a bond between
two innocent hearts

907
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:06,026
A bond, you can never break

908
01:35:09,338 --> 01:35:11,031
It's truly said,
whoever has said it...

909
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:14,826
You can never forget
your first love

910
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,456
I like meeting you
and talking to you

911
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:21,541
What are you thinking about?

912
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:24,044
I've been wondering about
what you're thinking.

913
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:28,048
I wish I could forever rest
in your dark tresses

914
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:33,553
To look at you;
to desire you...

915
01:35:34,696 --> 01:35:36,864
and to be lost
in a world of my dreams

916
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:38,558
Ever since I have
set my eyes on you...

917
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,560
I remember nothing else

918
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:45,565
I even take the fairy tales
for true now

919
01:35:52,714 --> 01:35:54,574
I'm going mad...
I think

920
01:35:54,716 --> 01:35:56,493
Couldn't God find a place
farther away?

921
01:35:59,388 --> 01:36:01,081
You mustn't crack
such jokes.

922
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:03,724
Tell me something.

923
01:36:03,725 --> 01:36:05,585
There's a temple near your house.

924
01:36:07,354 --> 01:36:10,423
So why drive for 5 hours, walk for
another 2 hours and come here?

925
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:13,885
God is God, no matter
what place it is.

926
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:18,431
You drove for 5 hours, walked for
2 hours and came here... what for?

927
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:28,499
For my love, of course.
- Right.

928
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:33,113
God puts those in love
to a test.

929
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:38,535
But He never lets anyone
return empty-handed.

930
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,769
So hurry up and ask for
whatever you want.

931
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:51,131
I have a problem.

932
01:36:52,774 --> 01:36:54,759
I've always been to the Church
with Mrs. Godinho.

933
01:36:55,778 --> 01:36:59,139
I don't know how to pray
in a temple.

934
01:37:00,783 --> 01:37:02,475
Whether you do this, this
or this...

935
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:05,787
...always pray with
all your heart, okay?

936
01:37:05,788 --> 01:37:09,149
What have you asked for?
- And what did you ask for?

937
01:37:10,793 --> 01:37:13,486
I've asked for love.

938
01:37:13,796 --> 01:37:16,156
And I've prayed to her to
breathe life into your love.

939
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,828
Really?
- Yes.

940
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:33,173
How about making a wish together?

941
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:36,176
You will certainly have your love.
I promise.

942
01:37:36,819 --> 01:37:43,183
Here are the offerings.

943
01:37:43,826 --> 01:37:51,191
It isn't right for a married woman to
go without vermilion in her parting.

944
01:37:51,834 --> 01:37:53,835
Will you apply the vermilion?

945
01:37:53,836 --> 01:37:57,155
How is my wife?

946
01:37:57,506 --> 01:37:59,199
What's up? Why doesn't
someone tell me?

947
01:37:59,842 --> 01:38:01,701
How is my wife?

948
01:38:02,261 --> 01:38:05,513
How is my wife?

949
01:38:05,514 --> 01:38:08,141
Why don't you tell me how my wife is?

950
01:38:08,142 --> 01:38:09,709
So no one's saying anything.

951
01:38:34,877 --> 01:38:40,240
But why are you so quiet?

952
01:38:40,883 --> 01:38:45,078
Why don't you say something?

953
01:38:46,889 --> 01:38:51,251
Why are you in bed?

954
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:55,922
You must get up.
For my sake.

955
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:59,551
Don'tworry.

956
01:38:59,902 --> 01:39:03,263
I'm here.

957
01:39:03,906 --> 01:39:08,602
Now no one can take us apart.

958
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:11,605
Rahul, what's going on?
Go to your cabin.

959
01:39:11,914 --> 01:39:14,774
Doctor, why are you taking me away from
my wife? She's sick. She needs me!

960
01:39:14,917 --> 01:39:19,779
She's going to be fine.
Go to your cabin.

961
01:39:20,923 --> 01:39:25,285
Take him away.

962
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:29,789
I'm not going.

963
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:34,294
Take him away.

964
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:37,797
What's wrong with her?

965
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:41,593
Metwith an accident.

966
01:39:42,945 --> 01:39:48,308
Yes, car.

967
01:39:48,951 --> 01:39:52,646
Come.

968
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,295
Why do people make cars?

969
01:40:01,296 --> 01:40:02,989
Even if they make cars, why do
people have to travel in cars?

970
01:40:03,966 --> 01:40:07,327
You tell me, people can walk too.

971
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:13,333
That was Rahul. A patient
in our mental ward.

972
01:40:20,732 --> 01:40:22,342
My Papa has inconvenienced you.
I apologize for him

973
01:40:22,985 --> 01:40:25,111
- Was that your Papa?
- Yes. Ever since Mama's death...

974
01:40:25,112 --> 01:40:26,847
..he has been sick. Please
forgive him and pray for him.

975
01:40:28,991 --> 01:40:34,020
When he was here...

976
01:40:35,998 --> 01:40:40,360
...how come...

977
01:40:40,669 --> 01:40:42,362
..you were looking so afraid?

978
01:40:42,671 --> 01:40:46,283
Monty, you got your brains
in the wrong place.

979
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:50,011
You're a suspicious fellow.

980
01:40:50,012 --> 01:40:51,872
Goverdhan has known him all along

981
01:40:52,014 --> 01:40:55,876
Don't you ever say things
like that about Romi.

982
01:40:57,019 --> 01:41:01,214
Look Pooja is absolutely normal.

983
01:41:03,442 --> 01:41:08,388
I have been through
all her medical reports.

984
01:41:09,031 --> 01:41:13,810
She needs no further
treatment in this hospital.

985
01:41:14,036 --> 01:41:16,396
May God bless us on
this auspicious day

986
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:19,707
May you live long

987
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:22,043
May the apple of our eyes
live long and all be well

988
01:41:22,044 --> 01:41:24,404
You are our only hope.
Let all be well

989
01:41:46,068 --> 01:41:49,429
Come, come in son

990
01:42:13,095 --> 01:42:15,455
No son! Notthe leftfoot.

991
01:42:26,108 --> 01:42:29,761
The rightfoot.

992
01:42:33,115 --> 01:42:38,478
It's a ritual.

993
01:42:39,121 --> 01:42:40,981
When husband and wife step into
their home forthe firsttime...

994
01:42:44,126 --> 01:42:49,823
The rightfoot is the bestfoot
to putforward. It's a good omen.

995
01:43:34,176 --> 01:43:37,204
Come in.

996
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,539
Whenever Pooja came home,
she would make the place so lively.

997
01:43:55,197 --> 01:43:59,392
This homecoming isn't quite like that.

998
01:44:11,839 --> 01:44:14,574
Times are changing so fast
... it gives me the jitters

999
01:44:14,716 --> 01:44:17,077
Yes?

1000
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:20,221
- Do something.
- Yes?

1001
01:44:20,222 --> 01:44:22,974
Find a good boy and get
Jahnvi married right away.

1002
01:44:22,975 --> 01:44:25,377
She's your daughter. You find the
boy. As forthe wedding, anytime.

1003
01:44:25,519 --> 01:44:28,421
What's the hurry?
Let Pooja recover first.

1004
01:44:28,564 --> 01:44:31,232
You could look for a boy afterwards.
- The wedding will happen...

1005
01:44:31,233 --> 01:44:32,926
only after Pooja has recovered.
But she can get engaged before that.

1006
01:44:33,235 --> 01:44:35,069
- I have a suitable boy.
- Forget that one. I'm here

1007
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:36,763
I'll look for a boy. After all,
I too have a responsibility...

1008
01:44:37,906 --> 01:44:39,933
..towards this family. Besides,
there might be someone she likes.

1009
01:44:40,242 --> 01:44:41,909
If that was the case,
she would've surely told me.

1010
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:43,578
- How could she possibly tell you?
- Romi is right.

1011
01:44:43,579 --> 01:44:45,939
All right, then find outwhether
she likes someone. If not...

1012
01:44:46,248 --> 01:44:48,916
I'm giving you the responsibility.
Find a good boy for her.

1013
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:50,944
Your Daddy has given me
a responsibility.

1014
01:44:51,253 --> 01:44:53,238
What?

1015
01:44:53,672 --> 01:44:56,950
To find a suitable boy for you.
Someone like me.

1016
01:44:57,259 --> 01:45:01,621
Tell me something.
Have you chosen someone for yourself?

1017
01:45:13,275 --> 01:45:15,610
Why do I get a feeling...

1018
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:19,139
that you're going to marry
someone you like...

1019
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:21,141
..not someone your family wishes?

1020
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:23,643
No. I'm going to marry someone
whom my family prefers.

1021
01:45:24,286 --> 01:45:28,648
Who else but you can decide best
about your own life?

1022
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:32,652
They are my elders.
And about my life...

1023
01:45:32,711 --> 01:45:34,613
they'll take a careful decision,
won't they?

1024
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:38,658
Besides, do you think they will
get me married off to a nobody?

1025
01:45:39,301 --> 01:45:40,802
This is your life.

1026
01:45:40,803 --> 01:45:44,305
Will you spend the rest of your life
with someone whom you don't love...

1027
01:45:44,306 --> 01:45:48,168
with someone you don't even know?
- Now you're serious!

1028
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,170
I can't deny my folks their happiness.
- All you care for are your folks?

1029
01:45:50,312 --> 01:45:52,672
- What about my happiness?
- You too will be asked to opine

1030
01:45:57,319 --> 01:46:00,180
After all, you're the
senior son-in-law.

1031
01:46:00,322 --> 01:46:02,098
And irrespective of whom I marry,
you are the one...

1032
01:46:02,324 --> 01:46:04,684
who will sing at my wedding.
You will, won't you?

1033
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:07,187
Tell me, which song
is it going to be?

1034
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:12,692
To tell you I love you

1035
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:15,962
Somebody kill me

1036
01:46:15,963 --> 01:46:18,339
Leave me to simmer

1037
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:20,700
What is the heart and love?

1038
01:46:20,843 --> 01:46:23,370
Forget that

1039
01:46:24,346 --> 01:46:26,347
Love is nothing but a game.
Kill the whole issue

1040
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:28,349
Just ensure that you're never sad.

1041
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:30,502
But you always fall short!

1042
01:46:30,644 --> 01:46:33,380
If this is the song you'll sing,
the marriage party will run away.

1043
01:46:34,356 --> 01:46:38,218
What I don't want is happening
and what should happen isn't!

1044
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,053
And you're spitting away!
Try to understand me.

1045
01:46:41,363 --> 01:46:45,366
I am so tense!
Why does this always happen to me?

1046
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:48,019
why? The right things never happen!

1047
01:46:48,871 --> 01:46:51,189
And what shouldn't happen
do take place. Do you follow?

1048
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:53,567
Just as staying hungry
is not a matter of food.

1049
01:46:53,709 --> 01:46:56,570
Similarly I don't have
to explain to talk less.

1050
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,714
No you're explaining to me?

1051
01:46:59,715 --> 01:47:02,075
Sit down and I'll explain to you!

1052
01:47:02,384 --> 01:47:05,386
- It's a commode.
- Sit on it!

1053
01:47:05,387 --> 01:47:07,388
- Jahnvi's problem is...
- Yes?

1054
01:47:07,389 --> 01:47:09,749
When I tell her something...

1055
01:47:09,892 --> 01:47:12,544
She thinks it is Romi speaking.

1056
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:18,691
- Whereas it is me not Romi!
- You said that.

1057
01:47:18,692 --> 01:47:20,760
When I tell herwhat's in my
heart, she thinks it's Romi.

1058
01:47:20,819 --> 01:47:23,404
Whereas it is not Romi!
It is l!

1059
01:47:23,405 --> 01:47:27,434
Because I'm me not Romi!

1060
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:32,413
I am Romi but I'm not Romi. I'm me!

1061
01:47:32,414 --> 01:47:35,750
You're bleating like a goat.
You'll be slaughtered like one!

1062
01:47:35,751 --> 01:47:37,777
Enough now. Let's eat dinner.

1063
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:40,755
When I open my heart to her,
she thinks I have no character!

1064
01:47:40,756 --> 01:47:42,616
Why and how does she think that?

1065
01:47:42,758 --> 01:47:45,785
You knowwhat a character I possess!

1066
01:47:46,428 --> 01:47:48,262
Then? Today I'll tell her
everything clear-cut.

1067
01:47:48,263 --> 01:47:51,291
I am me, she is her
and you are you!

1068
01:47:51,433 --> 01:47:55,462
- I am me.
- I'll tell her that too!

1069
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:58,798
Tell her. Then what?
She'll love the real you!

1070
01:47:59,441 --> 01:48:03,303
She will hate you!

1071
01:48:04,446 --> 01:48:09,142
Then don't ask me why you
only find girls in dreams!

1072
01:48:09,785 --> 01:48:11,811
Why not in real life? Don't ask me
And what about Mahesh Hirwani?

1073
01:48:12,454 --> 01:48:15,815
He will cancel your recording!

1074
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:21,488
- Then clap your hands at home.
- Why don't you keep shut?

1075
01:48:23,882 --> 01:48:26,326
Whatwould you say if
you were Mrs. Godinho?

1076
01:48:26,468 --> 01:48:28,469
- Me..?
- Yes.

1077
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:32,123
- I'd be Mrs. Godinho?
- What would you say?

1078
01:48:32,474 --> 01:48:36,503
If I were her, I'd say...

1079
01:48:46,488 --> 01:48:51,518
Imagine it. Your first recording..

1080
01:48:52,494 --> 01:48:55,856
- The song is a sure hit.
- Yes.

1081
01:48:55,998 --> 01:48:59,834
- Your songs are playing all over.
- Yes.

1082
01:48:59,835 --> 01:49:01,502
- Your posters are put up
everywhere. - Yes...

1083
01:49:01,503 --> 01:49:04,865
- Not only kids, even
- Fathers are dancing!

1084
01:49:05,507 --> 01:49:08,509
You are super hit!

1085
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:12,513
- Your pictures in the papers...
- Are being printed!

1086
01:49:12,514 --> 01:49:14,849
- Girls queue for your autograph.
- They do!

1087
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:18,211
- Car, bungalow...
- Secretary!

1088
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,506
and you'll get your dream girl too!

1089
01:49:22,524 --> 01:49:24,885
I will get her, isn't it?

1090
01:49:24,943 --> 01:49:28,889
Speak on my master, my bread
winner Mr. Oberoi.

1091
01:49:34,536 --> 01:49:36,396
- My finance giver.
- Romi here.

1092
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:40,233
Same thing, son-in-law.

1093
01:49:40,542 --> 01:49:42,903
- What's the news?
- Has Anu Malik returned?

1094
01:49:44,546 --> 01:49:47,741
Everything is done.
Anu Malik is here.

1095
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,052
And Sameer is here to
write the song.

1096
01:49:51,053 --> 01:49:53,888
And the publicity is
on in full swing!

1097
01:49:53,889 --> 01:49:56,349
Now I'll throw 1000000
cassettes in lndia.

1098
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:57,918
And 2000000 cassettes abroad!

1099
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,923
- When is the recording?
- Tomorrow.

1100
01:50:19,915 --> 01:50:21,691
My master, it's at 2.
Please come to the studio.

1101
01:50:23,335 --> 01:50:25,737
Caught you!

1102
01:50:26,588 --> 01:50:30,216
- I won't let go!
- Are you mad?

1103
01:50:30,217 --> 01:50:33,286
Come to prison!
You turned me mad!

1104
01:50:34,012 --> 01:50:37,791
Now you don't recognize me!
You cheated me out of 200000!

1105
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,794
Thanks to you the world thought
I'm mad. Gave me electric shocks!

1106
01:50:41,603 --> 01:50:45,298
Have you experienced it?
The world turns dark!

1107
01:50:45,607 --> 01:50:48,635
The body starts smoking!

1108
01:50:53,365 --> 01:50:56,643
I won't let you go! Pay me back!

1109
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:00,605
- Sorry, uncle.
- Uncle?

1110
01:51:04,626 --> 01:51:06,319
You recognize me?
Why did you do this to me?

1111
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:10,490
I want to know why?

1112
01:51:16,638 --> 01:51:18,999
I had problems.
I'll pay your 200000.

1113
01:51:30,652 --> 01:51:33,513
Of course I'll take the 200000!
But I also want the interest!

1114
01:51:35,657 --> 01:51:37,350
All right. Here is the
money for the interest.

1115
01:51:46,668 --> 01:51:50,030
This is the interest money.
When will you pay the principal?

1116
01:51:50,172 --> 01:51:52,032
Can I fool the uncle of my friend?

1117
01:51:52,674 --> 01:51:57,037
Trust me, uncle.

1118
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,539
Don't cry. Okay.
But I won't spare you!

1119
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:04,044
I'll go home on the motorcycle!

1120
01:52:04,686 --> 01:52:07,047
Twerp! Get off the motorcycle!

1121
01:52:07,356 --> 01:52:10,884
- What is it nitwit?
- What does that mean?

1122
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,720
This is my motorcycle. I'll
charge you for sitting on it!

1123
01:52:14,363 --> 01:52:17,390
- Is it yours?
- Is it your Pop's?

1124
01:52:23,705 --> 01:52:26,399
Catch him! He's running away!
The cheat is taking the bike!

1125
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:28,568
Wasn't the bike yours?

1126
01:52:31,713 --> 01:52:33,573
He'd given me the bike as interest
for the 200000 he owed me!

1127
01:52:34,716 --> 01:52:38,078
Did he fool you too?

1128
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:42,082
He fooled, cheated and
deceived me. I am ruined!

1129
01:52:42,724 --> 01:52:45,085
He cheated me of 200000!

1130
01:52:46,061 --> 01:52:47,754
You thrashed me?
If all of you beat him..

1131
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:50,715
I'll pay you 500 bucks!

1132
01:52:59,074 --> 01:53:00,741
- What?
- 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000!

1133
01:53:00,742 --> 01:53:02,936
I'll pay you a lakh!
Break his arms and legs!

1134
01:53:03,745 --> 01:53:07,107
He has cheated me twice before.

1135
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:10,751
Once I lay my hands on him,
I'll settle all scores.

1136
01:53:10,752 --> 01:53:12,445
Sir!

1137
01:53:12,754 --> 01:53:14,781
I remember. You are Raju!

1138
01:54:02,805 --> 01:54:04,497
My name is Romi. What is it?

1139
01:54:05,808 --> 01:54:08,810
But remind me of the time we met.

1140
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:11,270
You were in the ladies compartment
of the train. With no pajamas!

1141
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:13,173
The ticket checker caught you
and the police hit you with sticks.

1142
01:54:13,816 --> 01:54:16,176
- I bailed you out!
- Good Lord! Did this happen?

1143
01:54:16,819 --> 01:54:20,180
- Yes.
- Sir...

1144
01:54:20,823 --> 01:54:24,184
You may leave. I wish to discuss
something importantwith Romi.

1145
01:54:24,827 --> 01:54:26,828
Do you know what this is?

1146
01:54:26,829 --> 01:54:31,024
Yourfather has nominated me.

1147
01:54:33,836 --> 01:54:35,837
This means henceforth
your house, your offices..

1148
01:54:35,838 --> 01:54:40,200
Your businesses and properties..
I own all of them!

1149
01:54:40,259 --> 01:54:44,538
I thought yourfatherwas
very smart, a good businessman.

1150
01:54:48,851 --> 01:54:51,711
But yourfatherturned out
to be a big fool!

1151
01:54:52,855 --> 01:54:56,174
If I want, I can get
yourfamily to the road!

1152
01:54:56,358 --> 01:54:59,052
And I can make yourfather beg!

1153
01:55:00,863 --> 01:55:02,722
Pooja...speak up.

1154
01:55:03,282 --> 01:55:06,226
Try my dear.

1155
01:55:06,869 --> 01:55:09,229
Lift your arm, my child.

1156
01:55:09,371 --> 01:55:11,497
Which arm had she lifted?

1157
01:55:11,498 --> 01:55:15,569
- Lift your arm.
- Make an effort.

1158
01:55:15,878 --> 01:55:19,547
There's no reason to be depressed.

1159
01:55:19,548 --> 01:55:21,575
This is good news for us.

1160
01:55:22,885 --> 01:55:26,888
I came here to become a singer.
To earn some money!

1161
01:55:26,889 --> 01:55:30,892
That is why I needed your support.

1162
01:55:30,893 --> 01:55:33,895
But now you and your Daddy
will need me all your lives!

1163
01:55:33,896 --> 01:55:36,256
You slapped me, right?

1164
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:39,259
Nowthe echo ofthat slap will
be heard by yourfamily forever!

1165
01:55:49,912 --> 01:55:51,605
I'll bring yourfamily to the road!

1166
01:55:53,916 --> 01:56:00,280
And I'll place a begging bowl in
yourfather's hand and make him beg!

1167
01:56:08,931 --> 01:56:14,294
Come on, slap me. Slap me!

1168
01:56:15,938 --> 01:56:18,798
Hit me. Come on!

1169
01:56:25,948 --> 01:56:32,312
Slap me, abuse me.

1170
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:02,342
Butwake up.

1171
01:57:04,987 --> 01:57:11,351
I don't want to be the master.

1172
01:57:12,995 --> 01:57:17,023
I don't... everyone will be so happy.

1173
01:57:19,001 --> 01:57:21,862
They were so happy when
you raised your arm.

1174
01:57:23,005 --> 01:57:28,869
Now I can't bear to see them sad.

1175
01:57:30,679 --> 01:57:35,876
Please wake up.

1176
01:58:53,095 --> 01:58:59,960
Please get up.

1177
01:59:01,103 --> 01:59:07,133
You won't get up?

1178
01:59:07,442 --> 01:59:17,811
You won't? Don't get up!

1179
02:00:32,194 --> 02:00:38,225
I'll go and tell everyone
right now I'm Raj not Romi!

1180
02:00:39,201 --> 02:00:42,229
Afterthatwhetherthey call
me a fraud or send me to jail..

1181
02:00:43,205 --> 02:00:45,899
I don't care!

1182
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:52,572
Because you'd be responsible for it!

1183
02:00:53,215 --> 02:00:56,409
What are you doing here?

1184
02:02:06,622 --> 02:02:09,482
- Who is Raj?
- Where is Raj?

1185
02:02:10,626 --> 02:02:12,319
God! What now?
Raj is dead!

1186
02:02:13,295 --> 02:02:17,157
Raju is dead without dying!

1187
02:02:19,301 --> 02:02:23,663
Look, he's innocent.

1188
02:02:24,306 --> 02:02:28,668
I admitwhatever he did was
because he wants to be a singer.

1189
02:02:32,314 --> 02:02:38,512
Now he's acting as Romi
because he loves you.

1190
02:02:40,322 --> 02:02:42,098
He loves you a lot.

1191
02:02:42,324 --> 02:02:44,684
The truth is he wants to be
Pooja's brother-in-law not yours.

1192
02:02:45,327 --> 02:02:47,354
Today is his first recording.

1193
02:03:00,342 --> 02:03:02,494
Forgive him today. Tomorrow
I'll get him there personally.

1194
02:03:05,347 --> 02:03:07,374
- What does he think? He..
- Where is Raj?

1195
02:03:14,356 --> 02:03:16,383
What a voice! See that?

1196
02:03:19,361 --> 02:03:21,513
He hasn't sung a note and
you're showering praise.

1197
02:03:25,367 --> 02:03:28,395
He even clears his throat in tune.

1198
02:03:29,371 --> 02:03:31,565
Just a minute.

1199
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:34,401
- Sing something.
- Heart...

1200
02:03:36,378 --> 02:03:38,405
Slightly lower pitch..

1201
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:43,243
- Heart, heart...
- Fantastic!

1202
02:03:43,385 --> 02:03:46,387
Just a minute, Mahesh. Lower octave.
Sing in a lower pitch.

1203
02:03:46,388 --> 02:03:48,248
Try to understand. He's the
son-in-law. I'll go low if you wish.

1204
02:03:52,394 --> 02:03:55,255
- Now begin.
- You're being funny.

1205
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:10,103
I want him to sing in a lower pitch
and you're sitting down for nothing.

1206
02:04:11,079 --> 02:04:13,773
- You're being foolish.
- You're being silly.

1207
02:04:14,416 --> 02:04:17,777
He's the son-in-law, can't climb
down. He'll always remain high.

1208
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,281
- You sing on.
- Heart...

1209
02:04:21,423 --> 02:04:23,783
The crazy heart

1210
02:04:28,096 --> 02:04:29,789
what's he singing?

1211
02:04:30,432 --> 02:04:32,292
I tell you dear, I love you

1212
02:04:34,770 --> 02:04:38,131
The heart is crazy

1213
02:04:40,442 --> 02:04:42,802
Crazy...

1214
02:05:12,474 --> 02:05:14,334
Crazily in love

1215
02:05:15,477 --> 02:05:17,504
The heart is turning crazy

1216
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:23,677
Crazily in love..

1217
02:05:24,486 --> 02:05:28,348
Lost in love.

1218
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:34,688
Why would I get the feeling
you want to say something to me?

1219
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:48,535
Tell me what to do

1220
02:05:49,511 --> 02:05:53,874
Do I live or should I die?

1221
02:06:00,522 --> 02:06:02,883
The eyes would smile
but be filled with tears

1222
02:06:04,526 --> 02:06:07,470
I had everything but for you

1223
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:10,531
What else do you need?
Life is nothing without you

1224
02:06:10,532 --> 02:06:13,518
Love me so much that
I lose my senses

1225
02:06:13,535 --> 02:06:17,538
I should die without you

1226
02:06:17,539 --> 02:06:19,232
Not be able to bear separation

1227
02:06:19,541 --> 02:06:22,210
Love abounds everywhere
that I set my glance

1228
02:06:22,211 --> 02:06:25,405
My prayers have been answered

1229
02:06:26,548 --> 02:06:28,909
I came to ask you for my love.

1230
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:33,554
Today she is with me.

1231
02:06:33,555 --> 02:06:36,917
But cure the person
who brought us together.

1232
02:06:37,059 --> 02:06:38,919
Jahnvi's union with me will be
the signal that you heard me.

1233
02:06:39,561 --> 02:06:42,923
Do me anotherfavor.
Make Pooja stand on her feet.

1234
02:06:43,565 --> 02:06:46,567
Mrs. Godinho always says,
you get what you ask for others.

1235
02:06:46,568 --> 02:06:48,678
Hence forth I won't
ask you for anything.

1236
02:06:49,571 --> 02:06:52,432
Give Pooja a new lease of life.

1237
02:06:54,576 --> 02:06:57,270
Breathe live into Pooja.

1238
02:06:57,579 --> 02:06:59,689
My Pooja is all right!

1239
02:07:00,582 --> 02:07:04,085
My Pooja!

1240
02:07:04,086 --> 02:07:07,588
You are all right?

1241
02:07:07,589 --> 02:07:09,549
You are all right!

1242
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:12,244
Son, Pooja is fine now.

1243
02:07:14,596 --> 02:07:16,889
You've always been
with us in our sorrow.

1244
02:07:16,890 --> 02:07:18,625
We'll be together
even in this joyous moment.

1245
02:07:20,602 --> 02:07:23,296
Why is she crying?

1246
02:07:24,606 --> 02:07:27,968
She would wipe our tears
and is crying herself.

1247
02:07:28,235 --> 02:07:30,278
She's been holding back
hertears for so many days.

1248
02:07:30,279 --> 02:07:32,389
Let her cry.

1249
02:07:32,614 --> 02:07:35,475
See who I've brought.

1250
02:07:37,244 --> 02:07:39,980
Yes...

1251
02:07:43,292 --> 02:07:45,986
Too much exertion isn't good.

1252
02:07:47,629 --> 02:07:49,990
- Let her rest.
- Nothing to worry.

1253
02:07:50,132 --> 02:07:52,784
She was sleeping for some days
Now she is awake.

1254
02:07:52,968 --> 02:07:55,287
In a few days, Pooja will...

1255
02:07:59,975 --> 02:08:03,336
Let her rest.

1256
02:08:03,645 --> 02:08:05,422
Listen...

1257
02:08:05,647 --> 02:08:08,008
Where are you going?
Stay with me.

1258
02:08:36,678 --> 02:08:40,373
Yes, you stay here.

1259
02:08:40,682 --> 02:08:44,044
Why did you save me?

1260
02:08:45,687 --> 02:08:47,464
Why did you save me?

1261
02:08:47,689 --> 02:08:50,050
If you can pretend to be Romi
to save my Daddy and me..

1262
02:08:50,359 --> 02:08:54,846
Can't I act as your wife
to save your career?

1263
02:08:55,697 --> 02:08:58,725
You need rest. Your husband
will come and see you later.

1264
02:09:53,755 --> 02:09:57,909
The heart loves the one who
was a stranger till yesterday.

1265
02:09:58,093 --> 02:10:00,120
The one who gave me life,
I want to die for him.

1266
02:10:02,431 --> 02:10:04,124
Both sisters got
cheated by the same man!

1267
02:10:04,766 --> 02:10:07,043
You are Romi! Pooja's husband!

1268
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:12,132
How will I face Pooja?

1269
02:10:12,774 --> 02:10:15,135
I swear I am Raj not Romi!

1270
02:10:15,778 --> 02:10:18,471
You are lying! You thought
Pooja isn't going to wake up.

1271
02:10:18,781 --> 02:10:24,144
So let me trap Jahnvi!

1272
02:10:26,455 --> 02:10:28,815
God! Such a deception!
Thank God I don't have other sisters!

1273
02:10:29,792 --> 02:10:31,484
What? Master, leave that instrument.

1274
02:10:45,808 --> 02:10:52,172
Do you remember who I am?

1275
02:10:59,822 --> 02:11:03,183
I've met you somewhere.
Yes, I remember!

1276
02:11:08,831 --> 02:11:12,859
- Listen to him.
- You are Romi, our son-in-law.

1277
02:11:14,837 --> 02:11:18,865
No, I met you in the music company.

1278
02:11:19,842 --> 02:11:21,618
- Yes, I remember!
- Listen...

1279
02:11:23,262 --> 02:11:28,708
We danced together and
my drawstring broke...

1280
02:11:29,852 --> 02:11:32,212
Sit down and play music!

1281
02:11:32,855 --> 02:11:37,551
- I'm going!
- Please don't go.

1282
02:11:38,861 --> 02:11:40,720
You...you're a big Romi!

1283
02:11:44,867 --> 02:11:46,893
No, I'm a big Raj!

1284
02:11:51,874 --> 02:11:53,875
- You are Romi!
- Ask your Dad if you don't trust me.

1285
02:11:53,876 --> 02:11:55,861
- what's wrong?
- Tell her who I am.

1286
02:11:56,879 --> 02:12:00,240
He's Romi, our son-in-law.

1287
02:12:01,884 --> 02:12:04,244
- Your brother-in-law.
- No, Jahnvi...

1288
02:12:08,891 --> 02:12:10,584
- What's wrong?
- Tell her who I really am.

1289
02:12:16,899 --> 02:12:18,758
- Really?
- Yes.

1290
02:12:19,902 --> 02:12:21,903
Dear, this is Raj not Romi.

1291
02:12:21,904 --> 02:12:24,556
He is Raj, he became Romi
because I asked him to.

1292
02:12:24,907 --> 02:12:27,767
Butwhy did Pooja call you Romi?

1293
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:31,104
Even I didn't understand that.

1294
02:12:31,914 --> 02:12:35,275
My album will be released in
2 days. To save my career.

1295
02:12:35,417 --> 02:12:37,611
Butwhy are you trying to
convince herthat you're Raj?

1296
02:12:38,921 --> 02:12:42,073
- Because we love each other.
- What?

1297
02:12:43,425 --> 02:12:45,577
What? What?

1298
02:12:45,928 --> 02:12:49,122
Now you don't raise a problem!

1299
02:12:49,932 --> 02:12:52,792
The problem has been solved.

1300
02:12:56,355 --> 02:13:00,133
My daughter likes the one I do.

1301
02:13:00,442 --> 02:13:02,302
What could be better than that?

1302
02:13:02,945 --> 02:13:06,806
Leave the hand.
Stay within limits.

1303
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:09,951
You know very well
that I'm Raju not Romi.

1304
02:13:09,952 --> 02:13:11,811
I'm leaving. Nowwe won't meet.

1305
02:13:11,954 --> 02:13:13,647
Take care of yourself.

1306
02:13:14,957 --> 02:13:18,151
Drive carefully.

1307
02:13:18,961 --> 02:13:21,295
My accident and your saving
me is a signal of the fact...

1308
02:13:21,296 --> 02:13:22,989
I have to live a long life with you.

1309
02:13:26,969 --> 02:13:29,329
- You!
- Yes but how did you guess?

1310
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:32,306
Your perfume.

1311
02:13:32,307 --> 02:13:33,975
How did you suddenly drop in?

1312
02:13:33,976 --> 02:13:37,003
Can't a wife come to see her husband?

1313
02:13:39,982 --> 02:13:41,675
Sure. Definitely.
Hasn't sister-in-law come?

1314
02:13:41,984 --> 02:13:44,344
- She's making arrangements.
- What?

1315
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,851
We're throwing a party at home
And here's your dress.

1316
02:13:50,993 --> 02:13:52,493
- I do have clothes.
- The party dress code is fusion.

1317
02:13:52,494 --> 02:13:55,689
You must be there by 8.30.

1318
02:13:55,998 --> 02:13:58,149
We'll be waiting for you.

1319
02:14:00,002 --> 02:14:02,003
The heart is anxious, the weather
is great. My beloved, I wait for you

1320
02:14:02,004 --> 02:14:04,297
I too waited for your
grandfather like this.

1321
02:14:04,298 --> 02:14:06,992
Grandma, you've been
through a lot because of me.

1322
02:14:07,009 --> 02:14:10,036
- Yes. - You must've thought
I considered her Sita!

1323
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:16,376
It is true.

1324
02:14:17,019 --> 02:14:18,686
In our times we had
neither disco nor club.

1325
02:14:18,687 --> 02:14:20,380
But there's so much for you.

1326
02:14:21,023 --> 02:14:22,883
Yet if you return home pure...

1327
02:14:23,025 --> 02:14:25,385
You are today's Sita.

1328
02:14:29,031 --> 02:14:34,186
There comes Romi!

1329
02:17:09,191 --> 02:17:14,054
You're quite late.

1330
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:19,559
The dogs made me run the other way.

1331
02:17:21,203 --> 02:17:26,399
- No, you're looking great.
- You too.

1332
02:17:28,836 --> 02:17:31,404
Come along, everyone
is waiting for you.

1333
02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:42,916
Come here.

1334
02:18:51,293 --> 02:18:55,655
You're looking fantastic!

1335
02:18:57,299 --> 02:19:01,661
Nobody can take their eyes off you.

1336
02:19:02,971 --> 02:19:12,672
Am I really looking so beautiful?

1337
02:19:13,315 --> 02:19:18,178
He's lying! I didn't
ask him to buy it.

1338
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:23,683
Listen to what Romi is saying.

1339
02:19:25,327 --> 02:19:29,689
I was saying,
Mrs. Godinho always said.

1340
02:20:16,378 --> 02:20:21,366
One must praise what one likes.

1341
02:20:22,384 --> 02:20:26,413
My internal feeling is
this pair is very good.

1342
02:20:27,806 --> 02:20:32,586
Now you are lying.

1343
02:20:33,395 --> 02:20:37,382
No, I spoke the truth both times.

1344
02:20:38,025 --> 02:20:43,054
These are internal feelings.
The heart never lies.

1345
02:20:43,405 --> 02:20:48,768
Your daughter is wonderful
but your son-in-law...

1346
02:20:50,412 --> 02:20:55,775
He's a real gem!

1347
02:21:22,444 --> 02:21:25,446
Yes and he's very proud.
Pooja is now better.

1348
02:21:25,447 --> 02:21:28,074
I think I'll send her away
in a day or two. - Good idea.

1349
02:21:28,075 --> 02:21:30,101
Come here.

1350
02:21:30,452 --> 02:21:33,313
- What are you doing? If..
- lf..?

1351
02:21:33,455 --> 02:21:35,232
What will Daddy say?
What will grandma think?

1352
02:21:35,457 --> 02:21:38,318
If Pooja sees us?
Whatwill Ramu think?

1353
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:42,322
Is that it?

1354
02:21:45,467 --> 02:21:48,161
Why are you standing far? Come close.

1355
02:21:48,804 --> 02:21:50,471
Closer still.

1356
02:21:50,472 --> 02:21:53,833
Closer....

1357
02:21:54,476 --> 02:21:56,978
Daddy is here!

1358
02:21:56,979 --> 02:22:00,840
She's fooling around.

1359
02:22:01,150 --> 02:22:03,260
- Come down when you finish talking.
I want you to meet somebody. - Yes.

1360
02:22:03,485 --> 02:22:06,179
what are you doing?
Whatwill people think?

1361
02:22:06,488 --> 02:22:08,489
Can't help it. Can't control.

1362
02:22:08,490 --> 02:22:10,350
- What??.
- I'll clear everything in the morning

1363
02:22:19,501 --> 02:22:21,361
That I'm Raj not Romi.

1364
02:22:22,504 --> 02:22:24,364
When will you get us married?

1365
02:22:25,507 --> 02:22:30,203
You talk tomorrow.
The marriage the day after.

1366
02:22:31,513 --> 02:22:33,874
- Why not tomorrow evening?
- Too early.

1367
02:22:35,517 --> 02:22:38,879
Stay in control. Get a hold on.

1368
02:22:40,522 --> 02:22:42,883
You will marry Jahnvi.

1369
02:22:44,526 --> 02:22:46,386
No.

1370
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:50,390
Don't worry, I said it won't.

1371
02:22:51,533 --> 02:22:53,518
You're always on the phone!

1372
02:22:56,038 --> 02:22:57,898
I was talking to the GE
about the flight.

1373
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:00,400
I'll find a good time in a day or
two and talk to brother and Jahnvi.

1374
02:23:01,543 --> 02:23:04,404
Itwill laugh'
Itwill shed tears

1375
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:12,913
It has to lose;
It has to possess

1376
02:23:16,558 --> 02:23:19,586
Morning and evening, in
solitude, it will sigh

1377
02:23:23,065 --> 02:23:24,925
Every heart that falls in love

1378
02:23:35,911 --> 02:23:37,604
Every heart that falls in love

1379
02:23:46,588 --> 02:23:48,740
In every eye...

1380
02:23:49,591 --> 02:23:51,785
It grows like a dream

1381
02:23:51,885 --> 02:23:53,954
Nobody has control over a heart
that thuds crazily

1382
02:23:54,096 --> 02:23:57,791
It will stay awake;
It will have to fall asleep

1383
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,463
It will live
It will have to consume venom

1384
02:24:04,606 --> 02:24:09,594
It will die for a handsome face

1385
02:24:10,612 --> 02:24:13,473
You give away your peace of mind

1386
02:24:16,618 --> 02:24:19,813
Why do you take anxiousness?

1387
02:24:21,623 --> 02:24:23,984
This is one such craziness...

1388
02:24:25,627 --> 02:24:30,323
...that gives its' life for love

1389
02:24:32,968 --> 02:24:37,664
It will have to keep mum.
It will have to speak out

1390
02:24:39,641 --> 02:24:41,668
It will have to bear
the pain of separation

1391
02:24:44,062 --> 02:24:46,006
Try as others might,
it won't get tired

1392
02:24:47,649 --> 02:24:50,677
- Good day.
- Caught him!

1393
02:24:51,653 --> 02:24:53,805
He is Raju who took 200000 from me!

1394
02:24:55,657 --> 02:24:57,517
And sent me to the asylum!

1395
02:25:06,668 --> 02:25:09,029
Nab him and call the police!

1396
02:25:09,671 --> 02:25:11,698
I was given current!

1397
02:25:12,674 --> 02:25:14,701
- Call the police!
- Stand here!

1398
02:25:26,688 --> 02:25:30,550
- You won't say a word. Quiet!
- He'll cheat you too.

1399
02:25:40,702 --> 02:25:43,730
Is your name Raju not Romi?

1400
02:25:46,041 --> 02:25:47,734
Why don't you answer?

1401
02:25:57,719 --> 02:26:00,413
Romi or Raju? You cheated us!

1402
02:26:01,723 --> 02:26:05,585
You played with ourfeelings!

1403
02:26:06,728 --> 02:26:09,589
Why did you do this? Why?

1404
02:26:09,731 --> 02:26:11,732
Is this how you repay our love?

1405
02:26:11,733 --> 02:26:13,593
Is this what Mrs. Godinho taught you?

1406
02:26:13,735 --> 02:26:17,097
Call her. Let us see her.

1407
02:26:17,406 --> 02:26:19,099
Is this how one cheats?

1408
02:26:22,744 --> 02:26:26,106
I told you another lie.

1409
02:26:26,748 --> 02:26:29,109
There's no Mrs. Godinho.

1410
02:26:30,752 --> 02:26:33,613
She left me when I was six.

1411
02:26:34,089 --> 02:26:35,782
I mean, she died.

1412
02:26:40,762 --> 02:26:42,455
She sometimes comes to
meet me, take care of me.

1413
02:26:46,768 --> 02:26:49,129
But since you came into my life..

1414
02:26:52,774 --> 02:26:54,634
She never came to meet me.

1415
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:59,556
She must have thought
Raju has found his family.

1416
02:27:04,787 --> 02:27:07,147
Now I'm not needed.

1417
02:27:07,790 --> 02:27:11,318
But it doesn't happen thatway.

1418
02:27:11,794 --> 02:27:15,947
It doesn't.

1419
02:27:16,131 --> 02:27:19,826
I need you. Badly.

1420
02:27:24,139 --> 02:27:25,999
I am sorry I said this.

1421
02:27:26,308 --> 02:27:29,669
Don't so much that
it neverfalls short.

1422
02:27:32,815 --> 02:27:34,674
But it always falls short!

1423
02:27:39,822 --> 02:27:44,684
What's wrong?

1424
02:27:49,498 --> 02:27:51,833
Daddy, why did Romi leave...?

1425
02:27:51,834 --> 02:27:54,027
You knew he was Raju not Romi?

1426
02:27:54,128 --> 02:27:56,196
Yet you supported him?

1427
02:27:56,839 --> 02:28:00,033
I supported him because
he is a boy with a good heart.

1428
02:28:00,843 --> 02:28:02,869
what did he do as Romi?
Think ofwhat he could've done!

1429
02:28:03,345 --> 02:28:06,206
He acted as my husband but
nevertook advantage of me.

1430
02:28:07,850 --> 02:28:11,711
You knew everything yet..

1431
02:28:12,855 --> 02:28:15,006
Daddy, you even gave
him power of attorney!

1432
02:28:15,858 --> 02:28:17,551
He could have taken over
all your wealth if he wanted.

1433
02:28:20,863 --> 02:28:22,722
Romi for whom I left you all
was the one greedy for wealth!

1434
02:28:22,865 --> 02:28:27,060
It was later that I realized
he loved my money not me.

1435
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:32,232
I wanted to give my life for Romi.

1436
02:28:32,875 --> 02:28:35,026
But Raju saved my life.

1437
02:28:36,879 --> 02:28:39,573
And this is how you
treated that Raju.

1438
02:28:47,306 --> 02:28:53,044
That wasn't good.

1439
02:28:56,899 --> 02:28:59,551
- Not good at all.
- Dear....

1440
02:29:02,237 --> 02:29:03,930
Do so much that it
never falls short.

1441
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,934
Yet it always falls short.

1442
02:29:08,911 --> 02:29:11,563
Yes, it falls short.

1443
02:29:11,914 --> 02:29:14,274
- He's my childhood friend.
- Good day.

1444
02:29:15,918 --> 02:29:18,445
You don't have a family.

1445
02:29:19,922 --> 02:29:23,283
And we don't have a son.

1446
02:29:24,927 --> 02:29:27,954
Why do you test my love?

1447
02:29:28,931 --> 02:29:30,707
You are my life.
Why do you take my life?

1448
02:29:30,933 --> 02:29:34,294
Please don't get mad at me
like you did at Pooja!

1449
02:29:48,951 --> 02:29:51,144
Raju really loves me!

1450
02:29:53,956 --> 02:29:57,317
He wants to marry me!

1451
02:30:00,254 --> 02:30:02,322
If he doesn't marry me,
he will die!

1452
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:06,952
Will you waste all the tears on me?

1453
02:30:08,303 --> 02:30:11,831
Why don't you understand?
He's my Dad.

1454
02:30:13,976 --> 02:30:18,338
How can I tell him
that I love you?

1455
02:30:24,987 --> 02:30:26,680
What would you say if you were me?

1456
02:30:26,989 --> 02:30:29,850
I would say...

1457
02:30:40,002 --> 02:30:43,196
And what would Dad say?

1458
02:30:47,009 --> 02:30:49,119
Do you really think
Dad will say this?

1459
02:30:54,016 --> 02:30:57,043
Then I'll go and tell him now!

1460
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:03,884
What is this?

1461
02:31:05,027 --> 02:31:10,390
- What? Meaning you..
- Yes, Daddy.

1462
02:31:12,034 --> 02:31:15,896
I don't knowwhen
I fell in love with Raju.

1463
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:19,733
What do you think?
Is marriage a game?

1464
02:31:30,052 --> 02:31:32,245
What is his status compared
to ourfamily and ours?

1465
02:31:33,055 --> 02:31:36,416
Is this what I had said?

1466
02:31:36,558 --> 02:31:38,418
...when you told me about Romi.

1467
02:31:39,061 --> 02:31:42,422
But now I won't say that.

1468
02:31:43,732 --> 02:31:45,759
I always want to see
happiness on your face.

1469
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:51,431
- I'm very happy today!
- So am l!

1470
02:31:52,074 --> 02:31:57,771
My news will knock your brains out!

1471
02:32:01,083 --> 02:32:03,443
What I will tell you
will knock your brains out!

1472
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:09,866
Come in. Then we'll see
who will knock outwhose brains!

1473
02:32:12,427 --> 02:32:14,120
First shut the door!

1474
02:32:16,431 --> 02:32:19,793
- First you tell me. - No!
- First you tell me!

1475
02:32:21,436 --> 02:32:25,131
- What?
- I was going to tell Dad.

1476
02:32:27,776 --> 02:32:32,305
But I already told him!

1477
02:32:33,115 --> 02:32:34,975
What?

1478
02:32:39,121 --> 02:32:41,122
We both fell in love together!

1479
02:32:41,123 --> 02:32:45,485
Our choice is the same from
childhood. So the boys too will be!

1480
02:32:46,628 --> 02:32:50,490
No, fine if they are similar.
But shouldn't be one boy!

1481
02:32:56,138 --> 02:32:59,499
Orthere will be a twist
in the story!

1482
02:33:00,142 --> 02:33:01,918
- Tell me. - No.
- Tell me...

1483
02:33:05,147 --> 02:33:10,010
Tell you something? He's handsome
but an even better human being.

1484
02:33:10,152 --> 02:33:14,848
- Now you tell me.
- I won't!

1485
02:33:17,493 --> 02:33:19,519
Tell me...

1486
02:33:21,163 --> 02:33:25,525
I've lived a life but incomplete.

1487
02:33:25,584 --> 02:33:29,029
Once I find him,
life will be complete.

1488
02:33:30,172 --> 02:33:32,866
wow! Poetry!

1489
02:33:34,176 --> 02:33:37,037
- Tell me, Pooja!
- As if you told me all!

1490
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:42,292
- Tell me!
- Okay.

1491
02:33:49,191 --> 02:33:51,301
His name is...
I won't tell!

1492
02:33:52,194 --> 02:33:54,221
Okay, listen...

1493
02:33:55,197 --> 02:33:56,864
Let's both tell each other
without saying a word.

1494
02:33:56,865 --> 02:33:59,559
I knew you'd like Monty!

1495
02:34:00,202 --> 02:34:02,896
- lsn't it?
- But I didn't know you'd like Raju.

1496
02:34:03,622 --> 02:34:06,900
You don't know Raju.

1497
02:34:07,209 --> 02:34:09,069
I was not conscious.

1498
02:34:11,213 --> 02:34:12,906
When I regained consciousness,
I knew what true love means.

1499
02:34:13,215 --> 02:34:14,991
Honest, I'd have died
if I hadn't found Raju.

1500
02:34:15,217 --> 02:34:17,994
You like Raju, don't you?

1501
02:34:26,228 --> 02:34:28,588
I like him if you do.

1502
02:34:30,232 --> 02:34:32,008
Calm down.

1503
02:34:33,235 --> 02:34:35,236
I'm missing mother a lottoday.

1504
02:34:35,237 --> 02:34:38,932
Look, my child...
We are very lucky.

1505
02:34:39,241 --> 02:34:42,102
I was wondering how long it
would take to repay sir's debt.

1506
02:34:43,912 --> 02:34:46,273
God gave us the opportunity
in this very birth.

1507
02:35:04,266 --> 02:35:07,377
I can give my life
for Pooja not just Raju.

1508
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:11,298
I always...

1509
02:35:12,274 --> 02:35:14,467
The heart of one daughter had to break

1510
02:35:15,611 --> 02:35:18,972
Look, don't you worry...

1511
02:35:34,296 --> 02:35:40,660
I'll fix everything.

1512
02:35:41,303 --> 02:35:46,499
No. Pooja has just
got a new lease of life.

1513
02:35:47,309 --> 02:35:59,679
Don't you want Pooja to be happy?

1514
02:36:01,323 --> 02:36:06,686
Then you won't say a word.
Or I'll getvery angry!

1515
02:36:08,330 --> 02:36:13,693
- Do you understand?
- I didn't know my child had grown up.

1516
02:36:16,338 --> 02:36:21,701
- You listen to me!
- Please listen Raju...

1517
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:40,720
Speak up.

1518
02:36:54,376 --> 02:36:56,570
Come on!

1519
02:36:56,712 --> 02:36:58,488
Pooja means more to me
than a real sister.

1520
02:37:40,422 --> 02:37:42,282
And Dad is dearer than my father.

1521
02:38:12,454 --> 02:38:16,816
Not once did they make me feel
I'm an accountant's daughter.

1522
02:38:20,462 --> 02:38:22,155
I'm highly obliged to them.

1523
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:25,325
- Me too.
- I want herto be happy.

1524
02:38:29,471 --> 02:38:32,832
- Me too. - But if she finds out
about us, she won't take it!

1525
02:38:34,476 --> 02:38:36,253
So please marry Pooja.

1526
02:38:39,148 --> 02:38:41,482
Said your piece?
Now may I speak?

1527
02:38:41,483 --> 02:38:43,176
May I speak?

1528
02:38:45,487 --> 02:38:48,156
You are now 19 years old.
I want you to live to a 100.

1529
02:38:48,157 --> 02:38:51,159
Will you sacrifice your coming
81 years for those 19 years?

1530
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:52,853
Do you know what 81 means?

1531
02:38:54,496 --> 02:38:59,693
Marriage, husband. Children.
Daughter-in-law, son-in-law.

1532
02:38:59,835 --> 02:39:01,611
Their children!
Will you give this all up?

1533
02:39:02,921 --> 02:39:04,865
If they have obliged you..

1534
02:39:15,517 --> 02:39:17,878
Kept you home for 19 years..

1535
02:39:17,936 --> 02:39:19,629
Call them here. I'll keep
them for 19 years and a day!

1536
02:39:20,522 --> 02:39:22,523
Do you love me?

1537
02:39:22,524 --> 02:39:25,886
Then please marry Pooja!

1538
02:39:26,528 --> 02:39:30,198
Listen to me.

1539
02:39:30,199 --> 02:39:34,535
I love you a lot. Marry Aba.

1540
02:39:34,536 --> 02:39:37,898
Because he's done me many favors.

1541
02:39:40,542 --> 02:39:42,402
He kept me in his house
for 19 days! 19 days!

1542
02:39:42,544 --> 02:39:45,238
I love him a lot.

1543
02:39:50,219 --> 02:39:53,330
Will you marry him?

1544
02:39:54,556 --> 02:39:56,416
Will you marry him?

1545
02:39:57,893 --> 02:40:02,255
Will you? Answer me!

1546
02:40:03,565 --> 02:40:05,759
Please marry Pooja.

1547
02:40:06,568 --> 02:40:09,262
Don't you want to marry me?

1548
02:40:32,928 --> 02:40:34,788
Then even I don't want to marry you!

1549
02:40:35,597 --> 02:40:37,958
Marriage causes the problem.
I'll marry neither you nor her!

1550
02:40:45,607 --> 02:40:48,301
Are you happy now?
Why are you crying?

1551
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:50,945
Be happy. Come on. Go.

1552
02:40:50,946 --> 02:40:52,639
Do you know what you're doing?

1553
02:40:53,615 --> 02:40:55,475
In any case, there's no other way.

1554
02:40:56,618 --> 02:40:58,979
Give it another thought.

1555
02:40:59,121 --> 02:41:01,314
Unless I leave,
Raju will never marry Pooja.

1556
02:41:01,623 --> 02:41:04,818
On every branch of the tree...

1557
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:08,921
flowers do not necessarily bloom

1558
02:41:08,922 --> 02:41:11,992
Everyone always gets not
the love he seeks

1559
02:41:12,634 --> 02:41:15,495
In solitude and music

1560
02:41:15,929 --> 02:41:18,331
Amongst your own
In the shadows...

1561
02:41:35,657 --> 02:41:39,019
It will smile even
on thorny paths

1562
02:41:39,661 --> 02:41:42,522
- Sing a song.
- Get lost!

1563
02:41:43,665 --> 02:41:46,000
- Move behind.
- No, it's all right.

1564
02:41:46,001 --> 02:41:47,694
Okay, give it fast.

1565
02:41:49,004 --> 02:41:52,673
Jahnvi, my child...

1566
02:41:52,674 --> 02:41:54,534
That's what I'm saying.
Pooja is getting married.

1567
02:41:55,677 --> 02:42:00,665
How do I look?

1568
02:42:14,696 --> 02:42:16,389
You look good in everything.

1569
02:42:16,698 --> 02:42:19,059
The other dress too is lovely.
Wearthat and show us.

1570
02:42:19,701 --> 02:42:22,062
Darling, it's getting late.

1571
02:42:22,704 --> 02:42:24,481
Now tell me how I look in this dress.

1572
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:30,570
Pirouette and show us.

1573
02:42:31,713 --> 02:42:33,532
You're looking lovely in this too.

1574
02:42:38,053 --> 02:42:39,746
- Grandma...
- She wants to show this to Raju.

1575
02:42:41,014 --> 02:42:46,086
She wants to impress him.

1576
02:42:46,728 --> 02:42:49,089
Did Jahnvi have to leave now?
She could tell me what suits me best.

1577
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,842
And in which dress Raju would like me

1578
02:42:56,738 --> 02:42:58,765
Raju himself has come.

1579
02:43:00,742 --> 02:43:02,602
You tell me, how do I look?

1580
02:43:05,414 --> 02:43:07,107
You're looking beautiful.

1581
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:11,444
I want to say something to you.

1582
02:43:14,756 --> 02:43:18,785
But there's no need
to say it. I know it.

1583
02:43:21,763 --> 02:43:23,456
But I'd like to hear you say it.

1584
02:43:25,184 --> 02:43:28,128
- Pooja, I don't...
- Won't this dress look better?

1585
02:43:31,773 --> 02:43:33,550
- I don't know.
- Pooja, wear it for him!

1586
02:43:35,778 --> 02:43:38,138
- Son...
- Yes?

1587
02:47:57,039 --> 02:48:00,066
We were coming to meet you
for Pooja's hand in marriage.

1588
02:48:00,375 --> 02:48:04,404
- The priest hasn't arrived.
- I'll check.

1589
02:48:11,053 --> 02:48:13,054
Pooja is so happy.

1590
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:15,749
Pooja's happiness is
now in your hands

1591
02:48:17,059 --> 02:48:19,920
May God keep both
of you happy forever.

1592
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,423
- where are the coconuts?
- Coming...

1593
02:48:36,078 --> 02:48:38,438
It has fallen short.

1594
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:40,941
Your existence doesn't matter.

1595
02:48:45,504 --> 02:48:50,450
Pooja? Tribhuvandas here.

1596
02:39:57,893 --> 02:40:02,255
Your jewelry is ready.
When should I send it over?

1597
02:40:03,565 --> 02:40:05,759
I'm Jahnvi.

1598
02:40:06,568 --> 02:40:09,262
You've dialed he wrong number.

1599
02:40:32,928 --> 02:40:34,788
- I've dialed the right number.
- No...

1600
02:40:35,597 --> 02:40:37,958
Maybe I've brought Pooja's phone.

1601
02:40:45,607 --> 02:40:48,301
Call on my cell and you'll
be able to talk to Pooja.

1602
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:50,945
Right. Also the solitaire
setfor both of you is ready.

1603
02:40:50,946 --> 02:40:52,639
- It's very pretty.
- I don'twant it now.

1604
02:40:53,615 --> 02:40:55,475
You won't get such a
pretty thing again.

1605
02:40:56,618 --> 02:40:58,979
Give it to Pooja on my behalf.

1606
02:40:59,121 --> 02:41:01,314
What are you doing? Do you
know what Raju is going through?

1607
02:41:01,623 --> 02:41:04,818
He's leaving all of us and
going to Goa permanently.

1608
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:08,921
He says he will only marry Jahnvi.

1609
02:41:08,922 --> 02:41:11,992
Why should I marry Pooja?

1610
02:41:12,634 --> 02:41:15,495
And he is right. Both of
you love each other so much.

1611
02:41:15,929 --> 02:41:18,331
Why should he marry Pooja?

1612
02:41:35,657 --> 02:41:39,019
I don't understand anything.
Why do you want him to marry Pooja?

1613
02:41:39,661 --> 02:41:42,522
Today you have shown...

1614
02:41:43,665 --> 02:41:46,000
The difference between your own
daughter and an adopted one.

1615
02:41:46,001 --> 02:41:47,694
Why did you ask herto sacrifice?

1616
02:41:49,004 --> 02:41:52,673
Why didn't you ask me?

1617
02:41:52,674 --> 02:41:54,534
Why didn't you talk to Jahnvi?

1618
02:41:55,677 --> 02:42:00,665
Why didn't you convince her?

1619
02:42:14,696 --> 02:42:16,389
And you...

1620
02:42:16,698 --> 02:42:19,059
You'd told me, your rescuing me
was a signal of the fact...

1621
02:42:19,701 --> 02:42:22,062
I have a long life to live.

1622
02:42:22,704 --> 02:42:24,481
Then how did you assume I would die?

1623
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:30,570
The man I like...

1624
02:42:31,713 --> 02:42:33,532
My sister loves him.

1625
02:42:38,053 --> 02:42:39,746
My sisterfinds hertrue love.

1626
02:42:41,014 --> 02:42:46,086
What could make me happier?

1627
02:42:46,728 --> 02:42:49,089
But you... were not fair
to my Jahnvi.

1628
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,842
Not fairto my Jahnvi.

1629
02:42:56,738 --> 02:42:58,765
All of you have been unjust to her.

1630
02:43:00,742 --> 02:43:02,602
Where is Jahnvi?

1631
02:43:05,414 --> 02:43:07,107
I ask you, where is Jahnvi?

1632
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:11,444
She left for America an hour ago.

1633
02:43:14,756 --> 02:43:18,785
Why do you like when
you're not good at it?

1634
02:43:21,763 --> 02:43:23,456
Which flight leaves for
America during the day?

1635
02:43:25,184 --> 02:43:28,128
Swear by me and honestly
tell me where Jahnvi is!

1636
02:43:31,773 --> 02:43:33,550
In orderfor you to marry Raju..

1637
02:43:35,778 --> 02:43:38,138
So she is marrying Monty.

1638
02:47:57,039 --> 02:48:00,066
I'm in a rush today.
Thrash me tomorrow.

1639
02:48:00,375 --> 02:48:04,404
Smart Alec!
We won't spare you today!

1640
02:48:11,053 --> 02:48:13,054
Rascal! We're not allowed
to eat onions by our religion.

1641
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:15,749
I knowthis today.

1642
02:48:17,059 --> 02:48:19,920
It's wrong to take advantage of
anyone. You run, I'll manage them.

1643
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,423
- You run away!
- Go, I say!

1644
02:48:36,078 --> 02:48:38,438
Where are you going?

1645
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:40,941
Put the wedding necklace
in the bride's neck.

1646
02:48:45,504 --> 02:48:50,450
I tell you, my beloved,
I love you

1647
02:41:55,677 --> 02:42:00,665
What are you doing?

1648
02:42:14,696 --> 02:42:16,389
Why are you doing it?

1649
02:42:16,698 --> 02:42:19,059
- Answer me!
- For you, stupid.

1650
02:42:19,701 --> 02:42:22,062
You want to lose your life
for my happiness?

1651
02:42:22,704 --> 02:42:24,481
Will you just stand there
orwill you come here?

1652
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:30,570
Brother-in-law.

1653
02:42:31,713 --> 02:42:33,532
- Come on.
- Yes, son.

1654
02:42:38,053 --> 02:42:39,746
Hit me as much as you want.

1655
02:42:41,014 --> 02:42:46,086
I've eaten lots of onions.
Beat me here. I'm a sinner!

1656
02:42:46,728 --> 02:42:49,089
Hit me here.

1657
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,842
I was thinking of what the dress
code should be in Jahnvi's reception.

1658
02:42:56,738 --> 02:42:58,765
I think it should be
swimming costume!

1659
02:43:00,742 --> 02:43:02,602
There's a lot of love
in this world.

1660
02:43:05,414 --> 02:43:07,107
You only need to lift
your eyes to see it.

1661
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:11,444
