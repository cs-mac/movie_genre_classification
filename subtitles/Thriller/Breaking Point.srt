<i>Welcome to the AVP Crocs Tour:</i>

2
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,722
<i>This is the final event on the road</i>
<i>to the Crocs Championship:</i>

3
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:43,633
<i>It's Samantha Lee and Kelly Reyes</i>
<i>versus Jen Crowe and Diana Wilkes:</i>

4
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,772
<i>Great cut shot by Kelly Reyes,</i>
<i>and Jen Crowe just can't quite get it up.</i>

5
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,811
<i>That brings up 13-all, they've tied it up.</i>

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,677
Stand loose. Keep it cool. It's still our game.

7
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,786
<i>You can tell how intense this has gotten</i>
<i>between Kelly Reyes and Jen Crowe.</i>

8
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,084
<i>They're jawing under the net.</i>

9
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,558
<i>It does not get any better than this.</i>
<i>It's the finals.</i>

10
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,290
<i>And Samantha Lee</i>

11
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,424
<i>and her partner Kelly Reyes</i>
<i>have proven they are no pushovers</i>

12
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,595
<i>to the veteran squad</i>
<i>of Diana Wilkes and Jen Crowe.</i>

13
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,631
<i>Someone's gonna have</i>
<i>match point after this.</i>

14
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,642
<i>Here comes Kelly Reyes with a jump serve.</i>

15
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>Diana Wilkes.</i>

16
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:35,213
<i>Oh, it's that signature shot.</i>
<i>And Samantha Lee, she cannot get it.</i>

17
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,017
<i>Match point for Jen Crowe</i>
<i>and Diana Wilkes.</i>

18
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,955
Good save. Nice set.

19
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,957
<i>The winners of this match will go on</i>
<i>to meet defending champions...</i>

20
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,466
Camera One, give me a crowd shot.

21
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,333
<i>...on Labor Day</i>
<i>in the AVP Tour Championships.</i>

22
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,000
This isn't college, Kel. You don't look
ready for the big time. Not just yet.

23
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,704
Time will tell, Jen, time will tell.

24
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,043
Come on.

25
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,248
Mine.

26
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,484
<i>From the right side, puts away.</i>

27
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,995
<i>But Crowe's got it up,</i>
<i>she'll have an opportunity!</i>

28
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:22,158
<i>And she grazes it off Reyes' shoulder,</i>
<i>and that is it.</i>

29
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,862
<i>Diana Wilkes and Jen Crowe have done it,</i>

30
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,371
<i>and you can see</i>
<i>the disappointment on Reyes' face.</i>

31
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,010
- Good game.
- Good game.

32
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,208
- Good game.
- Good game.

33
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,876
You were right, Kel, time did tell.

34
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,553
Thank you.

35
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,611
Our season is over.

36
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,584
No early morning runs. Drink up. Get laid.

37
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,185
I know I'm gonna try.

38
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,050
Sam, we lost.

39
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,426
No, no, no.
What we did, we totally gave them hell.

40
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,226
We upped the ratings for the finals.
That is what we did.

41
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,729
Chin up, Kel. This is a league event.

42
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,134
We're here to press the flesh
and push the sports.

43
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,130
Next year. We'll get them next year.

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,743
Absolutely, next year, next year.

45
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,374
Excuse me. Thanks.

46
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,978
Oh, come on, Kel,
I had two knees, three surgeries ago.

47
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,245
My next year was this year.

48
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,151
I'm done.

49
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,988
Got to go.

50
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:12,302
Miss Reyes. Hi. I'm Holden Gregg.
I'm a writer, sports writer.

51
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,778
Holden Gregg? Doesn't he cover basketball?

52
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,282
Yes, he does.
I can't believe somebody knows who I am.

53
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,784
Well, what are you doing slinging it
here at the beach?

54
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,515
I'm searching for the next big thing.

55
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,591
Sports on the cusp. You looked good today.

56
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,628
Well, just looking good
doesn't pay the bills.

57
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,957
We should have won.

58
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,328
I agree. You should have won.

59
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,925
Okay, then why didn't we?

60
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,200
You want my honest opinion?

61
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,968
What?
You're gonna diss Samantha to me now?

62
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,304
No, no.

63
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,282
I think it was your fault.

64
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,442
Really?

65
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,316
Second set, 6-to-4, you blew the serve.

66
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,346
It's been nice talking to you.

67
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,358
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Look, I want to interview you.

68
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,861
You know, a real interview,
not this party chatter.

69
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,862
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

70
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,523
Your girls are over there.

71
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,898
Well, there's nothing more boring
than a winner's quotes.

72
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,302
Well, there's nothing more desperate
than a loser's, but thanks anyway.

73
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,069
Can I give you some advice? Don't go.

74
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,312
Don't run away. You earned your spot here.
You deserve to have your picture taken also.

75
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,010
- That's what a star would do.
- I'm not a star.

76
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,215
Miss Reyes, look. I cover hoops, all right?

77
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,520
But the truth is, I love sport. I do.

78
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,688
I love the people that play
and commit themselves to it.

79
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,690
It's why I'm interested in you.

80
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,369
- I'll be in touch?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,702
All right, nice meeting you.

82
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,382
- Hi.
- Hey.

83
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,924
What?

84
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,896
This is it?

85
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,298
Place was dead.

86
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,133
Maybe nobody wanted to run into you
after you ate all that sand.

87
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,433
Funny.

88
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,532
We've lost a match before.

89
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,905
Remember last year in Miami?

90
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,809
All right, Jose, I think they get the point.

91
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,608
Here, entertain yourselves.

92
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,776
<i>Diana Wilkes was not only loved for</i>
<i>her sway and swagger on the court,</i>

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,980
<i>she was also loved for her years</i>
<i>of charitable work.</i>

94
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,250
<i>Routinely volunteering her time to charity...</i>

95
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,987
For God's sakes, she won a ball match,
not the Nobel Prize.

96
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,960
<i>...her hard climb from poverty.</i>

97
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:49,659
<i>Diana Wilkes,</i>
<i>the victim of a hit and run, dead at 26.</i>

98
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,760
<i>I'm Dain Blanton for AVP.</i>

99
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,616
The family thanks all of you for attending.

100
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,653
In the name of the father,
the son, the holy spirit. Amen. Go in peace.

101
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,831
Won't take long.

102
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,564
What won't?

103
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,142
For Matt to come a knocking on your door.

104
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,246
My door? What are you talking about?
He and Jen are engaged.

105
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,284
I mean, Jen doesn't have a teammate, Kel.
If she doesn't play, she forfeits.

106
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:44,789
You're the best bet in the finals.
Matt's a good coach, he knows that.

107
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,451
Are you kidding? She hates my guts.

108
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,991
It's too early anyway. I'm not going
to dance all over Diana's grave.

109
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,191
She's ashes, Kelly.
Come on, don't be a child.

110
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,699
When Matt comes to you with an offer,
think about your career.

111
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,603
Slinging hash in your dad's restaurant,

112
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,665
that isn't it.

113
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,031
What the hell was that?

114
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,693
Oh, that's what you would call an ace.

115
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,826
You want to wait till I set?

116
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,999
Oh, good one, Kel,
maybe you should ask the ref about that,

117
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,201
he might give you a do-over.

118
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,710
Jen, come on. Jen!

119
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,706
I need five.

120
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,315
Hey, take 10!

121
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,517
Don't take it personal. She'll warm up.

122
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,386
She just loves Di.

123
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,388
She's actually a really sweet person.

124
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,597
I know you hope that's true, Matt, 'cause
you guys are tying the knot and everything,

125
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,530
but I have a memory.

126
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,334
She tries not to show, but she's scared.

127
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,033
She should be. Nickels and Green
aren't exactly a cakewalk in the finals.

128
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,736
I'm not talking about that.
There's this guy hanging around.

129
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,278
Diana wouldn't talk about it.
She didn't want anyone to worry.

130
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:20,283
Some fan, stalker, I don't know what.
Cops are looking into it.

131
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,547
The cops?
Are you saying it wasn't an accident?

132
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,284
I'm just saying you should stick together.

133
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,223
You need each other.

134
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:33,264
You both worked way too hard and too long
to let an opportunity like this pass you by.

135
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,095
Yeah, okay, I've heard that speech before.

136
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,568
First from Samantha, then from
that reporter, and now from you, I get it.

137
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,765
Why don't you try to sell it to your fiancée?

138
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,898
Reporter? What reporter?

139
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,242
Holden Gregg.

140
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,813
Holden Gregg.

141
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,407
Wow.

142
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,714
When did you talk to him?

143
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,412
After the semis and again yesterday.

144
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,115
I have an interview with him this afternoon.

145
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,124
You have an interview.

146
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,430
Well, are we gonna practice or what?

147
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,479
The Kelly Reyes.

148
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,216
- Yes?
- What can I get you?

149
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,450
Vodka rocks, lots of lime.

150
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,225
Drinking in training.

151
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,727
- Please, don't write that.
- I'm kidding.

152
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,028
- Trust me.
- Trust you? Right.

153
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,332
Yeah, seriously, trust me.
I consider this an opportunity.

154
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,203
Well, I've read your stories, Mr. Gregg.

155
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,467
The opportunity is mine.

156
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,175
Well, I'm honored.

157
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,742
So, how was your first day of training?

158
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,990
- Jen Crowe give you the time of day?
- Jen is behind me. We're a team.

159
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,888
Interesting. That's not what I heard.

160
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,553
Wow. Straight in for the kill.

161
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,599
Yeah, you're right. Maybe I should get
a drink. Can I get a Scotch rocks?

162
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,928
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

163
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,593
Here you go.

164
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,500
All right, I got to be honest.

165
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:58,236
I'm not very good at this,
this whole formal interview thing.

166
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,708
Thank you.

167
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,614
Press junkets.
That's more Dain Blanton's territory.

168
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,550
Being a sports celebrity, what do you think
a perfect interview should be?

169
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,746
Well, I'm not quite a celebrity.

170
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,087
Well, you will be on Labor Day.
Just answer the question.

171
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,992
I guess talking about
what I do best instead of who I did.

172
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,824
So, no personal questions?

173
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,502
I hope we didn't miss out
on all the human interest stuff.

174
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,506
I'm not a human interest story.
I'm private. Understand?

175
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,405
Not for consumption.

176
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,610
All right.

177
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,376
No dumb comments about the way
I look or being a woman.

178
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,849
But you are a woman.

179
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,353
And this sport is very much
about a certain sex appeal.

180
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,358
I'm an athlete first.
You said you're interested in sports,

181
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,952
so I want questions about sport,
not spandex.

182
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,624
The psychology, the strategy,
and the daily commitment.

183
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,032
Okay, so only informed questions.

184
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,634
Let me guess, you could probably
tell me everything I need to know

185
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,865
about the sport in 15 minutes,

186
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,137
then the magazine could just
run it over and over again?

187
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,301
Pretty much.

188
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,106
Yeah, not much use for me.

189
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,910
You don't want me getting fired, do you?
I have bills to pay.

190
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,485
You know, people depend on me.

191
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,951
Wife and kids?

192
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,057
No, no. No kids. Just my mom and dad.

193
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,993
My wife died a few years back,
but don't apologize. You didn't know.

194
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,901
What do you say
we stop talking about cancer?

195
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,841
All right? My wife's, your dad's.
Just let that go.

196
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,151
You know, I had an idea.

197
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,144
What do you have in mind?

198
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,914
Change of venue.

199
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,646
Sure.

200
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,458
I want to show you something I found.

201
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,735
- Wow.
- So, who's Frank?

202
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,807
Well, I haven't seen that in years.
How did you find it?

203
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,535
I just dig deep.

204
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,442
That's bad.

205
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,382
All right, I guess you found us out.

206
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,678
Yeah.

207
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,345
I let him touch my boob.

208
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,856
But please, keep that out of the papers?

209
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,019
No, no, no, of course.
I was just making a point.

210
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,323
About?

211
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,563
Yeah. You know, you've been a...

212
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,569
Been a part of this place since
young Franklin touched your booby.

213
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,366
Long before that.

214
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,339
Took him years to get that far.

215
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,739
So,

216
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,048
what would you do if you didn't have it?

217
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,716
The talent in the sport, what would you do?

218
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,483
But I do have it.

219
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,024
Yeah, but...

220
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,260
I don't know, say you fell.

221
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,560
Tomorrow you broke your leg.

222
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,030
Legs heal.

223
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,396
Horrible car accident.
You're stuck in a wheelchair.

224
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,906
I'd coach.

225
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,404
I set my goals.

226
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,012
I reach them.

227
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,172
And then I set some more.

228
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,448
What about Franky?

229
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:34,086
Frank shouldn't have kissed
Lynette Wilchusky at my 13th birthday party.

230
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,922
Frank shouldn't have broken my heart.

231
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,595
Bastard.

232
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,228
All right, all right, last important question.

233
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,608
Is it enough?

234
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,803
Is the sport enough?

235
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,311
Is writing about sports enough?

236
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,374
No.

237
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,046
I mean, I'm passionate about it,
but it's not everything.

238
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,883
What's everything?

239
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,950
I don't know.

240
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,825
Finding someone to tie my life with, maybe.

241
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,002
Like a Franky but with scruples.

242
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,468
Who knew it? Holden Gregg.

243
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,312
Sports writer, closet romantic.

244
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,183
At last. I'm just being honest.

245
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,420
Reporters don't usually answer questions.

246
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,581
See?

247
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,351
I'm a columnist.

248
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,092
There's a difference.

249
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,093
It was in. That was in.

250
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,840
So that special someone,
the person you're tied to?

251
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,939
You had that with your wife?

252
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,945
Me too, with my dad.

253
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,949
It's not the same.

254
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,484
It's not. It's all about the choice.

255
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,611
You were his kid
so you didn't really have any say in it.

256
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,648
I don't know.

257
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:18,525
When you choose someone
or you're chosen,

258
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,426
it just kind of trumps everything.

259
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,828
You know, it makes
you feel like there's nothing

260
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,964
the world could throw at you
that you couldn't get through.

261
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,006
Do you want anything else?

262
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,718
It's kind of a loaded question.

263
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,518
Yeah, I could use a beer.

264
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,527
We don't have a liquor license.

265
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,521
There you go.

266
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,896
But I've got a loaded answer for you.

267
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,972
I've got a six-pack in my fridge.

268
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,805
Is Kelly Reyes inviting Holden Gregg
up to her apartment?

269
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,971
I set my goals.
I reach them and then I set more.

270
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,879
- It's all about choices, right?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,922
- This is it.
- Yep.

272
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,863
Yeah, second floor.

273
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,593
- What?
- There's somebody watching.

274
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,961
What?

275
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,961
Hey.

276
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,080
Damn it!

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,747
- You okay?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,463
- Did you see him?
- No.

279
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,658
Don't...

280
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,063
Don't worry.

281
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,570
He's just like a crack-head or something.
It's fine.

282
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:46,338
They said that Di had a stalker,
that maybe it wasn't an accident.

283
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,473
What?

284
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,785
All right, you know what?
You're not staying here by yourself tonight.

285
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,116
Come on.

286
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,652
You should call the police.

287
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,462
And say what?

288
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,355
That I saw who?

289
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,361
I could barely describe the man, can you?

290
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,462
Some reporter.

291
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,274
I'm serious.

292
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,806
I'll call tomorrow.

293
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,635
File a report.

294
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,308
That's all I can really do.

295
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,979
You're all done.

296
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,891
Very nice. Very professional job.

297
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,787
It still works.

298
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,438
Best interview ever, huh?

299
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,391
Have I shown you...

300
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,623
Have I shown you my room yet?

301
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,859
No? I didn't? What was I thinking?

302
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,349
Just wait till she takes the sweats off.
This chick is hot.

303
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,753
You know what, keep it professional
and keep your mouth shut.

304
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,019
Hey.

305
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,859
So, how do you not have a cell phone?

306
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,559
I don't need one. I'm not that late, am I?

307
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,465
Well, we've been trying to reach you
since last night.

308
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,730
Why?

309
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,767
- Miss Reyes?
- Yeah?

310
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,934
Hi.

311
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,277
I'm Detective Adams.
This is Detective Sandeval.

312
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,474
We're working the Diana Wilkes case.

313
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,882
I was wondering if we could have
a few minutes of your time.

314
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,581
Sure.

315
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,952
- Straw hat, you say.
- That's right.

316
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,929
That'll be all, Sandeval.

317
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,633
All right, well, we'll put it on the wire.
You never know.

318
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,403
Okay, good.

319
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,616
There's something else?

320
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,510
Yeah.

321
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,982
In the course of our investigation,
I talked to Miss Crowe again.

322
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,950
She mentioned your interview
with Mr. Gregg.

323
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,788
- She did, did she?
- Yeah.

324
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,293
Is that some sort of crime or something?

325
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,489
No, no. It's not a crime.

326
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,167
It's just that in addition
to the Diana Wilkes case,

327
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,133
I'm also looking into the disappearance
of Holden Gregg.

328
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,332
What are you talking about?

329
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,535
He hasn't disappeared.
I was with him last night.

330
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,975
You sure?

331
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,340
Yeah.

332
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,482
Pretty sure.

333
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,178
He even made me breakfast.

334
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,289
I'm sorry. Is Holden Gregg your boyfriend?

335
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,359
No, not really.

336
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,627
I've only known him for a week.

337
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,392
A week.

338
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,493
I see.

339
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,394
And when did you first see him?

340
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,699
Last Saturday at the party
after the tournament.

341
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,399
A day before Diana Wilkes was found.

342
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,668
So?

343
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,305
So Holden Gregg was seen
at the after-party.

344
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,176
But nobody has seen him since,
except for you.

345
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,313
But I have seen him. I was with him.

346
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,861
Who's that?

347
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,257
Yeah.

348
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,663
Miss Reyes, that's...

349
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,765
That's Holden Gregg.

350
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,458
Right in there.

351
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,932
- Any forcible entry?
- No, we are looking for them.

352
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,776
There were sheets and pillows.

353
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,779
Check the dryer, pull the lint tray.

354
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,549
They're connected,
Diana's death and Holden?

355
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,756
Well, I'd like some evidence, but,
yeah, I have jumped to that conclusion.

356
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,227
I'm sorry, Miss Reyes, this must be...

357
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,833
We just need some DNA.

358
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,429
Speaking of which,
we need permission to test your...

359
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:55,438
He used a condom and I took a shower
this morning, there's nothing there.

360
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,671
Okay.

361
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,942
You want physical evidence?

362
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,449
Well, that's the idea, yeah.

363
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,849
Fine, then I'll give you some.

364
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,615
Six feet, 180 pounds, brown hair, blue eyes.

365
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,089
I have a date with him tonight.

366
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,498
Here you go, thanks.

367
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,374
What's he waiting for?
Forty-five minutes late.

368
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,344
<i>Was he late last night?</i>

369
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,606
No, no, he was early.

370
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,980
Well, you know, whatever happens
I think you ought to dump this guy.

371
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,714
You deserve a man who's punctual.

372
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,323
- Okay, Officer.
- It's Detective.

373
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,319
Sorry. Detective.

374
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:42,951
Ed.

375
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,327
Detective.

376
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,626
<i>All right, guys, let's go home. He made us.</i>

377
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,499
Copy that, Ed.

378
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,775
What? What are you talking about?
That's it?

379
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,539
For the time being, yeah.

380
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,204
Look, Miss Reyes,
can I give you some advice?

381
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,508
Stay off the tour for a while.

382
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,982
Maybe, go out of town for a few weeks.
Let us do our job.

383
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,520
He's been seen, and he knows that.

384
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,816
He's gonna stay under the radar.
That's what I'd do if I was him.

385
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,051
The finals are in 10 days.

386
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,491
I've been waiting my entire life
for this match.

387
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,860
Hey, you know what?
Finals are about a trophy.

388
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,524
What we're dealing with here
is your whole life.

389
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,898
But you'll protect me, right?

390
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,471
Yeah. Of course, I will. I mean, to an extent.

391
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,133
Look, I have superiors to answer to,

392
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,804
and they're not gonna allocate
<i>the funds or the manpower, not 24I7.</i>

393
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,575
It's not gonna happen.

394
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,412
We're here to support
the whole community, not just you.

395
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,486
And if I called you Ed?

396
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:48,348
Miss Reyes, as of right now,
this man has done nothing to you

397
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,860
that you didn't allow him to do.

398
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,262
Now, look, this is not about what I believe.
It's about what I can prove.

399
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,597
As of right now, Holden Gregg
is simply a missing person.

400
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,932
And Diana Wilkes...
Well, for all we know, you know what,

401
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,574
maybe she was just a hit and run.

402
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,372
Now will you please take my advice?
Leave town. Let me know where you are.

403
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,939
I'm sorry.
But right now, that's the best I can offer.

404
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,252
I'm not going anywhere.

405
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,032
Come on.

406
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,275
Move it, Jen.

407
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,744
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

408
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,281
Come on. Come on. Focus.

409
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,145
Let's go. Come on.

410
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,752
Come on, Kel.

411
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,987
Good. Move your ass.

412
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,587
Go. Go. Come on!

413
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,928
Right, Jen, let's go. Let's go.

414
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,899
Come on, Kelly. Push, push, push.

415
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,234
Come on. That's it. Come on!

416
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,903
Let's go.

417
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,242
That's enough. Now to the mark.

418
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,445
Knees can only help that. There you go!

419
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,650
Come on, Kel.

420
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,920
Come on, Kelly, suck it up. Yeah.

421
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,934
Kel, maybe this was a mistake.
Maybe we can take a few more days.

422
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,199
Yeah, we don't have a few more days.

423
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,865
- She's right. Let's work.
- Let's go.

424
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,307
All right. Let's go. Come on. Come on.

425
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,613
No focus.

426
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,891
- Come on, it's right there!
- Right there.

427
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,322
Cut me some slack, Jen, okay.

428
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,123
Don't give me that.
I lost my best friend to this psycho.

429
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,824
- And I'm out here giving it my all.
- Come on.

430
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:12,665
Are you kidding me? At least he didn't
have his fucking hands all over you.

431
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,667
Come on!

432
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,509
Okay. It's all clear.

433
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,913
Kel, I need you to be honest with me.

434
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,361
You say the word no,
we'll call this whole thing off.

435
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,786
No.

436
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,389
- No, Matt, I said that I was gonna play.
- Okay.

437
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,435
All right, then if it's game time,
you gotta bring your game.

438
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,129
'Cause we can't play in the finals
the way we played today.

439
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,036
You're not the only one
with your reputation on the line.

440
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,076
Jen's gotta win though.

441
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,943
With Di gone, our endorsement
picture's cropped somewhat.

442
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,582
- You understand?
- I see.

443
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,912
Just life, Kel.

444
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,920
Neither one of us has a restaurant
that's paying our bills.

445
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,316
Hey, I'm sorry. With Jen's bad ankles,

446
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,791
we're looking at three, four
more productive years at most.

447
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,726
We have to worry about
how we look out there.

448
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,265
My A-game. That's what you get.

449
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,594
No exceptions.

450
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,279
Hello.

451
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:24,916
Hello.

452
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,818
I know it's you.

453
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,458
<i>You're very smart.</i>

454
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,897
Who are you?

455
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,932
I'm Holden.

456
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,963
I'm Holden Gregg.

457
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,232
He's dead. You killed him.
First Diana, and then him.

458
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,166
- Are you mad?
- Fuck you!

459
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,572
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

460
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,775
All right, I get it. You're mad.

461
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,248
<i>God damn it, Kelly.</i>
<i>Why'd you have to involve the police?</i>

462
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,646
Now, it's really gonna complicate
our relationship a bit.

463
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,687
<i>Why the hell are you doing this?</i>

464
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,087
Why does anybody do anything?

465
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,519
I don't know. First, you want something,
and then a want becomes a need,

466
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,997
and then pretty soon it's like a sport,
you commit yourself to it.

467
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,766
<i>- What do you want from me?</i>
- I want this.

468
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,862
I want this. I want you and me.

469
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,838
<i>I like being with you.</i>

470
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,505
You know, the truth is, this Holden...

471
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,114
Holden guy...

472
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,549
<i>I'm a lot nicer when I'm him.</i>

473
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,621
Yeah, why don't you tell the cop
that's standing right next to me?

474
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,627
Sure, I'd love to. Put him on the phone.

475
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,464
That was a bad bluff, Kelly.

476
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,502
<i>I would have expected something</i>
<i>a little more imaginative from you.</i>

477
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,831
They're gonna find you.

478
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,236
Really? They're gonna find me?

479
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,701
Guess what? I haven't gone anywhere.

480
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,675
I'm right here.

481
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,472
<i>Couldn't leave you if I tried.</i>
<i>I've given up my life for you.</i>

482
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,747
<i>Matter of fact, I'm right downstairs.</i>

483
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,318
I'm gonna come by and make you feel better,
just like I did the other night.

484
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,326
Kelly, you there?

485
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,524
<i>...apartment is vacant.</i>

486
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,570
<i>And there's no signs</i>
<i>of forcible entry and no fingerprints.</i>

487
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,169
<i>That's about all we got for now.</i>

488
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,210
All right. Thanks, pal.

489
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,075
Well? What?

490
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:36,277
No one's in your apartment.
No sign of forcible entry, no prints.

491
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,685
- And the recording from your phone, it's...
- Yes?

492
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,253
It's one-sided.

493
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,227
There's no other voice on that tape,
except for yours.

494
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,593
What? How?

495
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,529
Possibly a scrambling device.

496
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,432
They're available,
if you know what to look for.

497
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,700
And if that's the case, well, this guy's smart.

498
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,508
Smart just complicates things.

499
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:09,682
Let's see, forensics identified three sets
of prints from Holden Gregg's house.

500
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,354
His, yours, the maid's, that's it.

501
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,718
Great.

502
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,756
So what else don't we have?

503
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,954
Motive, frankly, not at this point.

504
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,565
I've told you. He's obsessed with me.

505
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,569
So what? He killed Diana Wilkes
because she was in your way?

506
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,462
He got rid of Holden Gregg,
so he could be closer to you?

507
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,699
Yes!

508
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,474
It's possible, but it's a bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

509
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,806
Okay. So?

510
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,652
We're on all points out.

511
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,884
- That's it?
- No, ma'am, that's not it.

512
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,481
Myself and three other detectives
are pulling double-duty on this case.

513
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,150
Look, Kelly...

514
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,491
Miss Reyes, I asked you
before to leave town.

515
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,966
Now, I'm gonna make
the same suggestion again.

516
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,333
I can't be any clearer.

517
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,575
So, what do you wanna do?

518
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,012
We listen to the cops, get out of Dodge,
all three of us till the finals.

519
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,084
- Ease up, babe.
<i>- What do you mean, "Ease up<i>"</i>?</i>

520
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,313
Game of our lives
is right around the corner, babe.

521
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,515
And there's some psycho out there
stalking us.

522
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,657
All right, so she's got a point.

523
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,793
We don't have a liquor license.

524
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,162
I wanna see a cop come in here now
and ticket you.

525
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,291
I really wanna see that.

526
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,960
Drink the beer.

527
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,201
We could go down to my brother's in Baja.
All we need is a net and a ball, right?

528
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,175
- I'm not hiding.
- Kelly, be reasonable.

529
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,177
This guy won't stop.

530
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,542
Exactly.

531
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,446
Look, Baja is just another beach to him.

532
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,452
It's just a little further south.
The guy makes phone calls disappear.

533
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,352
I'm betting he can find us down there.

534
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,550
Okay, so, what's your plan?

535
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,819
We go after him.

536
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,361
Oh, what, are you Rambo now?

537
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,525
All we need is a picture and his name.

538
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,397
And how do you propose
we get this murderer to pose for us?

539
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,867
Trying to look natural out here?

540
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,945
Shut up or you'll be sleeping on the couch.

541
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,718
I see him.

542
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,519
Call Jose. Three buildings down.
On the roof.

543
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,526
Are you sure?

544
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,125
Please, Jen. I know it's him.

545
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,861
Three buildings down. On the roof.

546
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,261
Call the cops.

547
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:21,738
- It couldn't be that easy, could it?
- Come on. Let's go.

548
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,313
Okay.
So, you're at the head of the table, Matt.

549
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,356
And you are back and forth
with the sweatshirt and the tank.

550
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,350
Just don't let him see your face.

551
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:14,021
Yeah. What if it doesn't work?
I mean, what if the cops don't show?

552
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,825
What did you say to the cops?

553
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,491
White girl getting her ass kicked
by some Mexicans.

554
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,660
They'll show.

555
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,788
<i>Attention all units, please respond</i>

556
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,620
<i>to a possible assault</i>
<i>on a young Caucasian female</i>

557
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,250
<i>by three Hispanic males.</i>

558
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,851
<i>Rooftop, Notte's Hotel...</i>

559
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,863
<i>Suspects are possibly</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

560
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,952
Come on.

561
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,694
Come on.

562
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,526
Shit!

563
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,998
Hey! You okay?

564
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,742
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

565
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,510
Chill out.

566
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,410
Sorry about that.

567
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,981
What are you doing? Stop it!

568
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,355
Stop! They're not gonna do anything,
all right?

569
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,963
They're on the roof right now.
They're calling it in.

570
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,498
And they're talking about
pussy and guns, all right?

571
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,624
They're fucking idiots. So, stop it.

572
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,966
Come on, baby. Come on.

573
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,100
- Kelly, where is it?
- What?

574
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,334
- Where is it?
- What?

575
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,205
- Where is it?
- What?

576
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,676
Baby, come on.
Where is the fucking camera?

577
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:54,216
Help! Please, help!

578
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,687
- Hey!
- Help!

579
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,695
- Ma'am, you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine! He went to the right!

580
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,060
He went to the right!

581
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,820
Do you want this evidence tagged now, sir?

582
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,050
Or should we wait for it
to ripen up some more?

583
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,687
- Sure this is the right one?
- I'm not delusional.

584
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,197
The junkie, he saw me toss it in.

585
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,199
The junkie.

586
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,396
Well, of course.

587
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,098
Don't treat me like a goddamn child!

588
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:56,239
I saw him. I took pictures of him.
He chased me.

589
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,672
Why doesn't anybody believe that?

590
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,012
Did you see him? Anyone? Up on that roof?

591
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,346
- Well, we were trying to make it look...
- Did you?

592
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:06,388
Yeah... Not really,
we were trying to make it look natural, so...

593
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,685
First, your guy goes out of his way
to hide from you.

594
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:12,353
Now, he's spying on you from rooftops,
chasing you, broad daylight,

595
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,396
- up and down the stretch.
- He's not my guy!

596
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,898
Did you know Holden Gregg
had a history of sexual assault?

597
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,024
No! Why would I?

598
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,365
Two victims.
One settled, another never testified.

599
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,459
Never met the guy!

600
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,539
There's physical evidence
placing you in his house.

601
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,699
Yeah. No shit! I gave it to you!

602
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,471
Did Holden step over the line?
Did you fight him off?

603
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,045
- Was it an accident?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

604
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,445
Come here. Come here. Come here.

605
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,416
- Is he serious?
- Who? Sandeval?

606
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,114
Sure, I guess he's pretty serious.

607
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,316
Is that what you think, too?

608
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,890
- I think what you did today was dumb.
- He's playing games.

609
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,726
No, Miss Reyes, he's not playing,
and this is not a game.

610
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,433
Come here.

611
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,061
Excuse me.

612
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,265
You think she can stay with you guys
for a couple of days?

613
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,636
At least until the match.

614
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,265
- Yeah. Sure.
- Good.

615
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,810
All right, here's how it's gonna work.

616
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,814
I want you guys to stay close together.
Do not let this guy isolate any of you.

617
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,314
- You clear?
- Yeah.

618
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,453
- Hey, man!
- Hey! Is that mine?

619
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,860
What's up? Yeah.
I thought you might want that.

620
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,432
- Thanks.
- Yeah. No problem!

621
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,095
Hey, homie, think there could be,

622
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,262
like, another 50 bucks there for me?

623
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,170
- No.
- Hey, come on, that's worth $40.

624
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,775
I already paid you for running
the other night.

625
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,276
Besides, I can't use these pictures anyway.

626
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,847
Look, doesn't even look like me.

627
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,007
- You think that guy looks like me?
- I think...

628
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,276
Okay. Go help her pack.
I'm gonna make some room in the trunk.

629
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,089
Hey! You mind?

630
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,091
Yeah. I do mind.

631
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,429
What the fuck happened to you?

632
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,468
You were somebody once.
You had five titles back-to-back.

633
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,800
And now, you're just
carrying some bitch's bags.

634
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,936
- How does that feel?
- Do I know you?

635
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,202
I don't know, Matt. Do you?

636
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,546
God damn. You still got some big muscles.

637
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,214
I don't know,
cut off the circulation to your brain?

638
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,085
I'm the guy. I'm the guy. Diana Wilkes.

639
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,385
- Tire tracks on her face. That was me...
- Motherfucker!

640
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,921
Matt, you okay? Huh?

641
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,925
Are you still with me, Matt?

642
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,297
You still angry?

643
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,033
Who's gonna protect the girls, Matt?

644
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,373
- Hey. Call it in.
- Copy.

645
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,073
First time I saw Matt, I was in high school.

646
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,078
On that tour, he was perfect.

647
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,681
And I hated him.

648
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,719
He was the golden boy, the champion.

649
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,756
The guy who got any girl he wanted.

650
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,594
But then, he came to watch me play.

651
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:26,232
He'd hang around afterwards
and just ask all the guys about me.

652
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,673
Me!

653
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,545
It was a whole year
before he asked me out and...

654
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,076
My God, the butterflies.

655
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,389
By then, he was all I could think about.

656
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,790
Hey, he's gonna be okay.

657
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,265
He's gonna be okay.

658
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,265
He's gonna be okay.

659
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,975
- You're ruining my life!
- Wait...

660
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,048
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. Take it easy.

661
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,686
Hello.

662
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:54,095
<i>You know what would</i>
<i>have been really nice?</i>

663
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,264
A thank you.

664
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,364
A fucking thank you.

665
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,202
Diana Wilkes was in your way.

666
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,973
And I took care of it for you.

667
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,435
We could've gone all the way.

668
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,174
We could've gone all the way
to the fucking Olympics.

669
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,849
And don't for a fucking second
act like you didn't like it.

670
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,845
<i>Because you did.</i>

671
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,117
How fast did you jump on
being interviewed, huh?

672
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:26,491
How fast did you forget about Diana?
Fucking fast.

673
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,689
<i>All you cared about was being famous,</i>
<i>well, you know what?</i>

674
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,866
You're gonna be way more famous now
than you ever would have been by yourself.

675
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:37,064
Because every time they think of you,
they're gonna think of me.

676
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,342
I'm gonna kill you on Labor Day,

677
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,571
in front of all those fucking cameras
you care so much about.

678
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,672
The last face you're gonna see,
is gonna be mine. You hear me?

679
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,586
Answer me.

680
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,223
<i>Answer me!</i>

681
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,378
It's all I've ever known, those courts.

682
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,007
And now after everything that's happened,

683
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,678
it's pretty much the only thing
that makes sense to me.

684
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,216
The cops want us to withdraw.

685
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,385
I know. It's sensible.

686
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,190
Oh, is that what you want to be now,
is sensible?

687
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,559
You know I don't want to quit.

688
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,361
They'll give the match to Holt and Brice.
They're next in line on points.

689
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,528
This thing goes on
whether we're in it or not.

690
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,738
You take someone's goals away,

691
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,310
their dreams,

692
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,213
what's left?

693
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,984
- If Matt wakes up...
- When Matt wakes up.

694
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,487
...I want him to be proud of me.

695
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,753
So are you in it or what?

696
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,590
Yeah.

697
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:15,263
Well, people, this is all bad news
as far as I'm concerned.

698
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,273
The venue is sold out,
which means thousands of ticket holders.

699
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:22,573
<i>Add to that, this heat wave,</i>
<i>and the beaches will be packed in by noon.</i>

700
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,240
Frankly, the show must go on bullshit
is inviting tragedy.

701
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,078
But that's what we have to deal with.

702
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,675
So says the mayor,
the city council, the league,

703
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,981
and even the players themselves.

704
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,354
<i>The Harbor Patrol will take the shoreline</i>
<i>and work the western perimeter.</i>

705
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,791
Event security, some two dozen strong,

706
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,921
will work the inside
and the adjoining lot with you.

707
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:47,025
They'll be dressed completely in yellow,
so that should scare the bad boys away.

708
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,166
And now, for my favorite part.

709
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:55,141
This will be a live televised sporting event,
so expect large camera crews.

710
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:59,773
We have multiple cameras, a dolly crane,
two hand-helds, satellite truck in the lot.

711
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,851
And all crewmen will wear security badges.

712
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,978
Now, people, I want you to check those
once, twice, three times.

713
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,492
All right, none of this smile away bullshit.
Our perp here is a slippery fuck.

714
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,222
We should add a cross-check
with security badges versus standard IDs

715
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:17,492
of any staffer matching the description.

716
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,229
That's a good point, Nick.

717
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:25,671
And lastly, but most importantly,
I want you to take a look.

718
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:30,303
You are to keep her in your sights
at all times. Understand?

719
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,880
All times.

720
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,486
<i>Hello and welcome to the AVP.</i>
<i>This is the grand finale.</i>

721
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:50,760
<i>The one we have all been waiting for,</i>
<i>the Tour Championship.</i>

722
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,698
And on any other day,
that would thrill enough.

723
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,431
But, Sarah, this tournament
means so much more.

724
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,767
You're right, Dain. Coming as it does...

725
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,397
- Go, Camera Two.
<i>...on the heels of tragedy.</i>

726
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,009
- Ready, Camera One.
<i>- As most of you know,</i>

727
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,907
<i>Diana Wilkes, the crown jewel of the sport...</i>

728
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,741
- And go, Camera One.
<i>...was found dead just weeks ago.</i>

729
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,042
Anybody got an update on Kelly Reyes?

730
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,778
<i>Currently, she's in the player's tent.</i>

731
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,409
All right, I want a 20 on her at all times.

732
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:17,424
<i>And that brings us to the most unlikely team</i>
<i>of Jen Crowe and Kelly Reyes.</i>

733
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,361
<i>Diana's former partner joining forces</i>
<i>with her long-time bitter rival.</i>

734
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,729
<i>So, Dain, how do you think</i>
<i>they match up with their competition?</i>

735
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,133
<i>Well, how does anyone match up</i>
<i>with Tori Nickels and Lynn Green?</i>

736
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:33,436
<i>The two towers have won more tournaments</i>
<i>than any other duo on the AVP tour.</i>

737
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:38,240
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise.</i>
<i>This is the finals. It is game on!</i>

738
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,406
<i>At 6'3"...</i>

739
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,374
It's show time.

740
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:53,156
<i>...ladies and gentlemen, Lynn Green.</i>

741
00:58:56,466 --> 00:59:00,459
<i>And her partner, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>she's won three NCAA titles...</i>

742
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,230
Was that pity?

743
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,074
<i>...give it up for</i>
<i>Tori "The Towering Inferno" Nickels.</i>

744
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,071
Hey, for Matt and Diana.

745
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,406
Let's knock these pituitary cases
<i>down to 5'10".</i>

746
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,178
Let's do it!

747
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,450
<i>...the high-flying, electrifying</i>
<i>young woman out of UCLA,</i>

748
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,685
<i>one of the deadliest servers in the world.</i>

749
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,657
<i>Seven other wins,</i>
<i>looking for her first-ever tour title,</i>

750
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,091
<i>Jen "The Hammer" Crowe.</i>

751
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,931
<i>Oh, I love to introduce her,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

752
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,437
<i>in just one season,</i>
<i>she has made it to the top.</i>

753
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:41,841
<i>In college, one of the most decorated</i>
<i>players of all time, four NCAA titles,</i>

754
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:47,848
<i>the blonde, blazing, bombshell,</i>
<i>here she is, Kelly Reyes.</i>

755
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,852
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the stage is set.</i>
<i>It is the Tour Championship.</i>

756
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:59,326
<i>Lynn Green, Tori Nickels, Kelly Reyes,</i>
<i>and Jen Crowe, are you ready?</i>

757
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,956
<i>The crowd is ready to go</i>
<i>and so are the athletes.</i>

758
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,799
<i>It's go time. Game is on!</i>

759
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,136
No! No! No!

760
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,733
<i>Nice pass by Jen Crowe. The rally goes on!</i>

761
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,746
<i>Cross court hammer by Nickels</i>
<i>out of the reach of Crowe.</i>

762
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,477
<i>Green and Nickels strike first</i>
<i>and take the early lead.</i>

763
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,021
<i>The teams are gonna be playing</i>
<i>best of three sets. The first two, to 21.</i>

764
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,885
<i>And the third, if we need it, to 15.</i>

765
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,185
Lieutenant, my orders have me
in the stands.

766
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,385
You got me working the parking lot?

767
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,427
Listen, Sandeval,
unless our guy plans on getting here

768
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:34,723
and huffing it across that sand,

769
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,695
the parking lot's
the only paved way out of here.

770
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,266
I need a good guy out here, all right.

771
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,232
The 12 cops on the barricade, they're yours.

772
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,203
- All right? You understood?
- What about courtside?

773
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,900
I got courtside. You handle the lot.

774
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:50,478
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, make a little noise.</i>

775
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,012
<i>Kelly Reyes slices and dices.</i>

776
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,382
Hey, what's happening?

777
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,546
Why are you asking me what's going on?
You're in the stands.

778
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,521
Lieutenant's got me out in the parking lot.

779
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,819
He what?

780
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,917
You listen to me. You don't take a piss
without my permission.

781
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,188
Do you understand me?

782
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,561
You know what, sir? Last time I checked,
lieutenant's got you way outranked.

783
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:20,164
<i>Here's Green!</i>
<i>Puts it away for another side out.</i>

784
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,412
<i>Nickels and Green are in for a fast out.</i>

785
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,344
<i>Reyes and Crowe cannot let</i>
<i>that get to them.</i>

786
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,184
- Freeze.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

787
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,950
Jesus Christ, Ed.

788
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,629
You match the description type.

789
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,360
Well, so do half the guys here.
Are you gonna shoot them also?

790
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,404
Why are you even down here?
You're supposed to be in the TV truck.

791
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,563
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

792
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,403
Ed, no buts.
No, no, you got your orders, follow them.

793
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,444
All due respect, sir. This is still my case.

794
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:01,577
Well, no disrespect, Ed,
but not if I have any say in it.

795
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:05,085
- Excuse me?
- Matt Cooper was on your watch.

796
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,588
It's not gonna happen here, all right?
So just get back to your post.

797
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:11,956
<i>Green and Tori Nickels pulling away</i>

You all right, Ed?

799
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,070
Yes, sir.

800
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,919
<i>So it'll be Nickels back to serve.</i>

801
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,419
<i>- Down the middle.</i>
- No! Out!

802
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,511
<i>- Looks out.</i>
- What?

803
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,090
<i>Oh, it's called in and Reyes is livid.</i>

804
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,151
<i>She goes to the line judge.</i>
<i>She's not gonna change her call.</i>

805
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,355
- Come on, it's out!
<i>- Now she goes to the referee</i>

806
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,093
<i>and I guarantee you,</i>
<i>he's not gonna overrule.</i>

807

<i>Hey, that is a tough break</i>
<i>at this point in the match.</i>

808
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,504
<i>That ball, Mike, is clearly out.</i>

<i>Kelly Reyes trying to get</i>

<i>Nice pass by Nickels.</i>

811
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,457
<i>And Nickels with a fierce hit</i>
<i>right to the center.</i>

813

What is she seeing?

816
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,486
- You okay?
- Yeah. Let's play ball.

817
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:53,556
<i>Nickels back with a float serve. Nice pass.</i>

818

<i>Nickels has an opportunity</i>

- Sandeval.
- Yes, sir.

821

- Anything?
<i>- Nada.</i>

822
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:09,533
Stay sharp.

823
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,876
<i>Can Jen Crowe and Kelly Reyes</i>
<i>stop the bleeding?</i>

824
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,683
- They got 100 cops out there. Just relax.
- They haven't exactly found him yet.

825
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,585
- Just concentrate.
- I am!

826
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,248
On winning, Kel. Not on him.

827
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:27,556
Look, this is our house.
He's not welcome here.

828
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,962
So let's go get them. Come on. Okay?

829
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,593
<i>Kelly Reyes and Jen Crowe come out</i>

<i>Jen Crowe will be back to serve.</i>

<i>Nice serve. Pass by Green.</i>

833

<i>Green up at the net and off the block.</i>

834
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:51,579
<i>So Green and Nickels start exactly</i>
<i>where they left off in the first game.</i>

835
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,726
<i>Float serve to Reyes.</i>

836
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,992
<i>See if they can make</i>
<i>something happen here.</i>

837
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:07,068
<i>Reyes with a hard hit to the sand.</i>
<i>That's exactly what they need.</i>

838
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,228
<i>Think something must have</i>
<i>switched on with Kelly Reyes.</i>

839
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,671
<i>That's the hardest I've seen her hit a ball</i>
<i>all tournament.</i>

840

<i>Jen Crowe on the back line</i>
<i>with a top spin serve.</i>

841
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:24,175
<i>It's handled well by Nickels.</i>
<i>Nickels cross court. She's dug by Crowe.</i>

842
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,416
<i>But an overset. Crowe somehow blocks</i>
<i>that ball into the court.</i>

843
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,987
<i>Jen Crowe and Kelly Reyes</i>

845
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,141
<i>Well, the momentum has changed</i>

846
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,544

<i>She slams another one home.</i>

848
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:59,579
<i>Reyes and Jen Crowe</i>
<i>play an unbelievable defense.</i>

849

<i>Great pass by Kelly Reyes.</i>

850

<i>The rally continues...</i>

851
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:11,492

<i>Reyes up. It's a joust. And it's in.</i>

852
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:20,908
<i>How about that? Reyes and Crowe put it</i>
<i>together and take game number two 21-19.</i>

853
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,511
<i>That'll force game number three.</i>

854
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:33,881
<i>Now we're deep into game number three.</i>
<i>All tied up at 13.</i>

855
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,052
<i>It's an ace down the middle.</i>

856
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,694
<i>Years of work, struggle,</i>
<i>and commitment come down to this.</i>

857

<i>It's game, match, and championship point</i>
<i>for Nickels and Green.</i>

858
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,696
<i>Kelly Reyes and Jen Crowe</i>

860
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:59,674
<i>You're exactly right. Reyes and Crowe</i>
<i>have their backs up against the wall.</i>

861
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,342
<i>It will be Reyes to serve it up.</i>

862
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:08,082
<i>She goes with a jump serve.</i>
<i>It's handled well by Nickels.</i>

863
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:13,287
<i>Great set. Cross court shot.</i>
<i>It's gobbled up by Crowe.</i>

864

<i>Can she put it away?</i>

865
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,296
<i>Yes, it's down the line and just in.</i>

<i>This is anybody's game.</i>

867
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,870
<i>Well, Reyes and Crowe dodged</i>
<i>one championship point.</i>

868

<i>Now they have an opportunity</i>

870
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,052
<i>An over pass.</i>

871
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,957

<i>As the play goes on here,</i>

872
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:46,323
<i>Reyes is gonna have an opportunity.</i>
<i>And she hits the back line.</i>

Jen! I need help!

888
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,493
It's Lieutenant Roos.

Lieutenant Roos!

890

Help us! Help us!

893
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,201

- Let go of me.

894
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:19,873
Miss Reyes. Miss Reyes, you gotta let
these guys do their job. All right?

895
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,647
It was right here. I'm going with her.

896
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,377
You take Miss Reyes to EMS.

897
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,454
Stay with her all the time.
Not out of your sight for a minute.

898
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:30,320
- I want two cars. I want an escort. All right?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

899
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,012
What do you want to hear?
That I expected this?

900
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,309
Two perps beat to a pulp, unconscious.

901
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,476
Not one but two separate occasions.

902
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,180
And this guy still has his badge,
this guy still has his gun,

903
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,812
and he's telling me what the fuck to do?

904
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,357
And I still didn't have enough
to suspend him.

905
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:08,452
- Bullshit.
- Ed, the point is he is still out there.

906
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:12,125
- Yeah, he's out there and he's coming back.
- You think?

907
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,925
You don't?

908
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,995
This guy just ran out in the middle of
a nationally televised sporting event.

909
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,701
He wants to be seen. He wants the fame.
What did he say? He said,

910
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:26,440
<i>"Every time, they think of you,</i>
<i>I want them to think of me." So yeah.</i>

911
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,483
- I think he is coming back.
- But how?

912
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:32,946
I don't know.

913
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,181
What about friends, family...

914
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,815
Come on. This guy doesn't have
any friends, he's on his own.

915
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,019
This thing is all that he is. This is it.

916
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,892
- We've got a full army on her now.
- Yeah, we had an army at the game.

917
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,695
All right, all we can do now
<i>is just sit on her for 24I7.</i>

918
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,830
- And you. This is yours now.
- You're goddamn right, it's mine.

919
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,873
You're goddamn right.

920
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,336
What are you gawking at?

921
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,352
- Can I help you?
- I'm Detective Adams.

922
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,089
She can't see you, but she has stabilized.

923
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,402
- Miss Reyes.
- Hey, Ed.

924
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,107
How is she?

925
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,271
She's in intensive care.

926
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,676
You can't go in there, not tonight.

927
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,453
Did you see the match?

928
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,917
Every point.

929
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:49,962
Jen's tough.

930
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,196
She's gonna come out of this alive.

931
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,136
I don't doubt that for a second.

932
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,967
But you need some rest.

933
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,781
You need to get some sleep.

934
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,284
And you'll protect me when I do?

935
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,581
I will.

936
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,988
You promise?

937
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,489
I promise.

938
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:32,303
Come on.

939
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,575
I want to see her.
I want to see Jen when she wakes up.

940
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,743
Tomorrow. I'll take you myself. First thing.

941
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,290
I'm your personal protection detail, ma'am.

942
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,383
- How long do you think that's gonna last?
- The truth?

943
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,995
Truth is I don't know.

944
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:05,298
I just know that this guy is smart.

945
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,608
And smart complicates things.

946
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,173
Tomorrow morning. Hospital.

947
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,973
- I have your word.
- Yeah.

948
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,920
Do you want something to eat?

949
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,927
I have some take-out leftovers.

950
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:30,194
- Only a week old.
- No, no, I'm fine.

951
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:37,433
- I'm gonna shower.
- Okay, Miss Reyes.

952
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:43,200
- You can call me Kelly.
- Okay, Kelly.

953
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:50,378
Kelly, listen, all of this...

954
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:56,113
All of this, it's our fault.

955
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,151
It's my fault.

956
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,129
And I'm sorry.

957
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,898
But we're gonna catch this guy, we will.

958
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,343
Yeah?

959
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,516
<i>Hey, pal.</i>

960
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,016
Looks like you got things
pretty buttoned up in there, huh?

961
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,421
Not taking any chances.

962
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,753
Roos?

963
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,520
<i>I prefer Holden.</i>

964
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:13,263
Yeah, well,
whatever makes you happy, Holden.

965
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,630
Thanks.

966
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,467
So, Ed,

967
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,400
<i>you got two in the front,</i>

968
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:25,711
two in the rear. You got Higgins on the roof.
You know he's asleep by now.

969
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,145
Oh, don't you worry.

970
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,480
When you turn yourself in, he'll wake up.
He's reliable that way.

971
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,712
No.

972
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:39,483
No, Ed. As far as turning myself in goes,
my money is still on you.

973
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:43,325
Although, you know, I'm going to have
to kill everybody else just to get to you.

974
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,433
So that's your plan, huh?

975
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:49,570
- You're gonna get in here, then what?
- Finish.

976
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,571
Ed, finish the job.

977
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,834
Yeah, but who'll see?

978
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:55,341
Everybody.

979
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,908
Everybody is gonna see it.
My eyes are everywhere.

980
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:03,849
Matter of fact, Ed.
Right now, you are taking center stage

981
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,454
in the prelude to our little show.

982
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:10,787
You might wanna spruce it up a little bit.
You just tuck your shirt in.

983
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,328
Cold.

984
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,432
Colder.

985
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,533
Colder.

986
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,106
<i>Freezing.</i>

987
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,104
Fucking A, you're terrible at this.

988
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,645
<i>Call yourself a detective.</i>

989
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,221
Unbelievable. Jesus Christ, Ed.

990
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,687
<i>You know those guys are gonna</i>
<i>shoot at anything that moves.</i>

991
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,382
Really? That's what you think
is gonna happen?

992
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:47,552
Guys are idiots.
They can't even see what's in front of them.

993
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,527
Yeah, but I do, Nick.

994
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,660
Again, I prefer Holden.

995
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,564
Is that right, Nick?

996
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:58,237
I see a sad man with a sad life
trying to impress a little girl.

997
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,170
Yeah?

998
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,578
Well, it takes one to know one.

999
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,174
Is that why you had her call you Ed?

1000
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,820
You still there? Nick?
Let me tell you something.

1001
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,658
You're not getting in here, asshole.

1002
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,664
Sure I am, Ed. I'm already inside.

1003
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,262
<i>And guess what?</i>

1004
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,599
Tonight, I'm prosecuting
the scorched earth policy.

1005
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,173
Nobody gets out alive.

1006
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,245
Plan B, Ed. Plan B.

1007
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,122
Damn it.

1008
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,758
Detective Adams?

1009
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,097
Ed? Ed?

1010
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,444
See this?

1011
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,282
You see this?

1012
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,748
There's you. There's me. Dead cop.
There's no fucking berets.

1013
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,917
It's all recorded for posterity.

1014
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,356
All of it on the news
no later than tomorrow afternoon,

1015
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,256
just like I fucking told you.

1016
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,297
Every time they think of you,
they're gonna think of me.

1017
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:07,164
You idiot. What did you see on the news
last week? Do you remember?

1018
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,792
Nobody does.

1019
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,763
You psychos come and go.

1020
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:16,310
Your fucking precious little 15 minutes
are going to go along with it.

1021
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:21,207
So what do you want, huh?

1022
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,510
What do you fucking want?
You want it to be a little more gruesome?

1023
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,517
Is that what you want?

1024
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,646
I'm gonna fucking cut you into little pieces,
I swear to God.

1025
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,191
I'll fucking cut you into pieces.

1026
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,808
You don't fight like a girl at all.

1027

So I hear the new girls from Florida

Yeah, I'm not really concerned about
