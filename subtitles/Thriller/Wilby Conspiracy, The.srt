{1}{1}25.000
{395}{447}July eighth, 1979...
{457}{543}...all the fathers of Nobel Prize|winners were rounded up...
{553}{611}...by United Nations military units...
{618}{665}...and actually forced at gunpoint...
{673}{740}...to give semen samples|in little plastic jars...
{747}{851}...which are now stored at Rockefeller|Center underneath the ice skating rink.
{858}{913}I wouldn 't want to be there|for the thaw.
{943}{974}I mean, it's disgusting!
{981}{1025}You know what they put in the water?
{1032}{1084}Fluoride! Yeah, fluoride.
{1096}{1167}On the pretext|that it strengthens your teeth!
{1176}{1247}That's ridiculous!|You know what this stuff does to you?
{1256}{1308}It actually weakens your will...
{1316}{1400}...takes away the capacity for free|and creative thought...
{1408}{1448}...and makes you a slave to the state.
{1521}{1628}Ever wonder about these right-wing|militia groups and survivalist types?
{1640}{1725}They say they're defending|the country from U.N. Troops.
{1732}{1838}They're yelling so loud,|my theory is that this is a conspiracy:
{1845}{1887}They are the U.N. Troops.|They're in place!
{1894}{1942}The infrastructure's ready.|It's a fait accompli.
{1949}{1999}They'll just take over,|we'll all be toast.
{2006}{2059}Oswald.|That's what I said, Oswald.
{2066}{2154}He said, "I'm just a patsy,"|which means he didn't do it, right?
{2161}{2209}Armand Hammer goes to the doctor.
{2217}{2261}The doctor says, "Armand...
{2268}{2366}...you've only got 3 minutes to live."|And he says, "That's terrible news.
{2373}{2443}Isn't there anything you can|do for me, Doc? 3 minutes"?
{2450}{2515}And the doctor says,|"Well, I can boil you an egg."
{2549}{2584}I guess not.
{2610}{2692}Ever see those advertisements,|"Got Milk"?
{2783}{2806}Open up!
{2821}{2852}Open it up!
{2859}{2889}What's going on?
{2917}{2952}Son of a bitch!
{2986}{3015}"Eat beef"?
{3022}{3129}That's like saying, "Smoke cigarettes"|or "Drive cars." It's really generic.
{3137}{3224}This guy looks at me and says, "You|think you're living in a free country"?
{3231}{3288}"You think it's a democracy?|Of course not."
{3295}{3374}Web sites, newsletters,|self-published manifestoes...
{3381}{3411}They think we're kooks.
{3418}{3497}George Bush knew what he was saying|when he said, "New World Order."
{3505}{3547}You remember those three little words?
{3554}{3653}He was a 33rd degree Mason,|and as ex-director of the CIA...
{3662}{3741}...he knew that saying that would|send conspiratologists everywhere...
{3749}{3799}...spinning, spinning their wheels.
{3806}{3847}Then they destroy|their own credibility.
{3854}{3933}Sister, I'm sure your heart's|in the right place, but...
{3941}{4041}...somebody's got to lift|the festering scab that is the Vatican.
{4101}{4191}A chip for identification so they can|track down an animal anywhere he's at.
{4198}{4285}You'll insert it under the dog's skin|and it's an identification thing.
{4292}{4364}I mean,|it's only a small logical step...
{4371}{4424}...till they start putting it|in us and our children.
{4458}{4545}Then before we know it,|they'll come with the pretext...
{4561}{4651}Is that one of the new $100s with|the changed picture of Ben Franklin?
{4658}{4689}Look at him.
{4696}{4769}He looks like the love child|of Fred Mertz and Rosie O'Donnell.
{4777}{4834}That's him.|Get rid of it, lady.
{4841}{4920}See the metal strip in it?|That's a tracking device.
{4926}{5001}If you got any more of those at home,|get rid of them.
{5017}{5120}They'll follow you. They know where|every one of those $ 100s is going.
{5177}{5264}Black helicopters.|You heard about black helicopters?
{5274}{5298}They're everywhere.
{5325}{5412}They're on whisper mode.|You can 't hear them till they've gone.
{5437}{5465}You know?
{5545}{5588}There's nobody there.
{5618}{5693}Where'd they go?|Oh, there was nobody in here!
{5702}{5761}What am I talking...|Why is the meter on?
{6274}{6349}- Where to, pal?|- Luxembourg Towers, on 7th.
{6669}{6705}The sound of love.
{6713}{6741}Excuse me?
{6748}{6781}That, what you just did.
{6817}{6848}That's love.
{6855}{6920}Love's just a way to say,|"I want to sleep with you."
{6934}{6977}Admit it.|I saw you kiss her.
{6984}{7040}You love her.|This is the street where love lives.
{7051}{7086}Love is bullshit.
{7124}{7168}Love gives you wings.
{7175}{7210}It makes you fly.
{7235}{7274}I don't even call it love.
{7292}{7334}I call it "Geronimo."
{7351}{7382}Geronimo?
{7392}{7447}Geronimo.|When you're in love, you'll...
{7454}{7536}...jump right from the top of|the Empire State and you won't care.
{7543}{7626}Screaming "Geronimo"|the whole way down. It's great.
{7633}{7712}But then you'll die. You'll squash|yourself. So what's the point?
{7719}{7784}I'm telling you,|love gives you wings.
{7824}{7867}She must be some girl.
{7903}{7951}I love her so bad, I just...
{7959}{7999}She wrecks me.
{8063}{8098}I'd die for her.
{8278}{8321}She feel the same about you?
{8347}{8383}I don't know.
{8443}{8478}I never told her.
{8495}{8524}Why the hell not?
{8719}{8760}I have some problems.
{9621}{9662}- You dumb creep!|- Oh, my God!
{9723}{9744}Stop the cab!
{9983}{10010}I'm sorry.
{10018}{10065}Shut up! Wacko!
{10087}{10126}Forget the fare.
{10375}{10404}Love Street.
{11191}{11296}Sure, it's possible that|Lee Harvey Oswald didn 't kill Kennedy.
{11303}{11352}And frankly,|it's possible Jack Ruby...
{11359}{11458}...didn 't kill Oswald. In those films,|you see this other guy hanging around.
{11469}{11528}Are you saying that|Oswald is still alive?
{11539}{11628}I'm not saying that. Somebody|who looked like Lee Harvey Oswald.
{11659}{11694}She's singing.
{12108}{12187}Can 't take my eyes off of you
{12215}{12242}Bingo!
{12611}{12668}I love you, baby
{12678}{12772}And if it's quite all right|I need you, baby
{13364}{13434}You're just too good to be true
{13466}{13499}Can 't take my eyes...
{13506}{13545}...off of you
{13561}{13638}You'd be like heaven to touch
{13657}{13722}I wanna hold you so much
{13729}{13764}Why do you do that?
{13817}{13856}Why do you push yourself?
{14798}{14838}What are you doing?
{14852}{14881}Go ahead, brother, play on.
{14888}{14916}What's up?
{15207}{15226}Look at him.
{15379}{15414}Can you swim, man?
{15433}{15514}The water main broke all the way|up on 40th Street and 7th Avenue.
{15521}{15564}They say the subway's a damn river.
{15571}{15598}Strange.
{15627}{15676}What's up, Jerry?|What are you thinking?
{15683}{15740}Water mains don't usually break|unless it's wintertime.
{15747}{15802}The pipes burst open|because it's cold.
{15815}{15864}It's only the first of October.
{15871}{15908}Reminds me of life in the delta.
{15915}{15952}Yeah, Mississippi, all right.
{15983}{16028}Mekong, my friend.|Mekong.
{16053}{16120}Flip, did I ever tell you|that the whole Vietnam War...
{16127}{16164}...was fought over a bet...
{16171}{16236}...that Howard Hughes lost|to Aristotle Onassis?
{16250}{16329}And they used my legs for a wishbone.|Nearly snapped my butt in half.
{16341}{16404}- Yeah, they owe you.|- No, you owe me!
{16421}{16454}I'll get you tomorrow.
{16461}{16512}- Peace.|- You too! Take it easy, Flip.
{17655}{17692}73, 74...
{17699}{17742}...75, 76...
{17905}{17949}Not bad. 1:31.
{17958}{18005}I can do that a couple more times.
{18012}{18054}More if I have to.|Don't think I will.
{18061}{18125}Someone's got a roof garden.|Ripe for the picking.
{18132}{18178}That's it. Health food.
{18195}{18270}That's disgusting! What is that?|You really don't need it.
{18313}{18349}I didn't leave this open.
{18356}{18438}Somebody's been up here.|Oh, I'm not the only one with a key.
{18855}{18904}Right where I left you.
{20166}{20200}Return to sender.
{20227}{20256}Disgusting!
{24902}{24955}Jerry... keys.
{25030}{25121}How come this is safe for me,|but not the keys.
{25354}{25376}Smart girl.
{25391}{25441}- How's that, Jer?|- Justice.
{25448}{25484}She wears a blindfold.
{25646}{25693}- You have an appointment?|- Naturally.
{25700}{25767}- Can you show us a slip?|- I'm not wearing one.
{25846}{25885}Good morning, Claudia.
{25894}{25973}This is what you wanted.|Your coffee's on your desk.
{25992}{26035}People, give me this room.
{26060}{26113}Not you, Miss Sutton.|You stay.
{26212}{26281}This is a request|from you for 18 wiretaps...
{26288}{26390}...on the Ezekiel Walters case,|a case we are no longer investigating.
{26410}{26451}I'm doing it in my spare time.
{26458}{26532}This is the Justice Department,|not Alice Sutton, P.I.
{26542}{26642}Walters got life on the bank bombing.|Until we get new evidence...
{26652}{26686}...this case is closed.
{26711}{26791}Do you know what it's like|to think you know what happened...
{26798}{26833}...but to never be sure?
{26850}{26934}I've been here 20 years, Alice.|I know what it's like.
{26986}{27084}Until you've investigated your own|father's murder, you have no idea.
{27116}{27153}Alice Sutton knows me.
{27160}{27201}You're making it hard on yourself.
{27208}{27255}Ms. Sutton 's psychotic's here again.
{27262}{27313}I want him out of here right now.
{27320}{27385}I have a right!|I am an American citizen!
{27392}{27447}I demand to see Alice Sutton!
{27522}{27583}This guy's a restraining order|waiting to happen.
{27590}{27619}Can I see Alice Sutton?
{27626}{27675}No, he can't.|He needs an appointment.
{27682}{27733}I have a right to be here.|She'll tell you that.
{27744}{27769}Get him out.
{27812}{27857}I haven't done anything wrong!
{27864}{27901}Officers, I'll take him from here.
{27908}{27961}I'm Alice Sutton. Sorry.
{28154}{28177}Hi, Alice.
{28198}{28241}You need to make appointments.
{28250}{28349}Can I make one now? In a few minutes?|I can wait if you're busy.
{28394}{28427}Come around.
{28487}{28526}I don't see the connection.
{28535}{28644}Come on! Six major earthquakes|in 31/2 years and the space shuttle...
{28651}{28721}...in orbit for every one.|Don't you think it's strange?
{28728}{28777}Testing some top secret|seismic weapon?
{28784}{28862}Not testing. Using.|Nukes are passé. We're talking...
{28877}{28910}...the weapon of the future.
{28917}{28962}What's it got to do with the President?
{28969}{29056}The President's in Europe at the moment.|Tomorrow he'll be...
{29091}{29154}...in Turkey,|right here along this fault line.
{29165}{29222}And they sent up|a space shuttle yesterday.
{29229}{29254}Motive?
{29279}{29340}How about $50 billion?|How's that for a motive?
{29377}{29424}Here, let me get that.
{29431}{29537}The President's cutting funding to NASA,|the milk cow of the aerospace industry.
{29544}{29654}So you're saying that NASA's going to|kill the President with an earthquake?
{29665}{29728}- Do you still ride?|- Not for years.
{29735}{29796}Why do you keep the picture of you?|Kind of wish you hadn't quit?
{29821}{29852}The earthquake.
{29863}{29902}Not exactly the kind of thing...
{29909}{29988}...a Secret Service agent can|just throw himself on top of, is it?
{30009}{30042}Mr. Wilson needs you.
{30049}{30072}Thank you.
{30113}{30157}She always burst in like that?
{30164}{30270}Yes, that's her job. I have to go.|My boss is looking to yell at me.
{30277}{30342}You want me to talk to him,|smooth things out for you?
{30349}{30422}No, I want you to go home|or wherever it is that you go.
{30429}{30502}And make appointments.|You can't just keep bursting in.
{30507}{30556}It's just what they'd be expecting.
{30643}{30728}I have a serious job here.|I have a boss I must answer to.
{30757}{30794}Do you understand that?
{30851}{30891}I'm sorry. You're right.
{30898}{30929}Use your common sense.
{30936}{30986}Deal. So are you going to warn him?
{30993}{31016}Who?
{31035}{31054}The President.
{31087}{31126}I won't promise you anything.
{31193}{31241}You think I'm crazy.|She thinks I'm crazy.
{31248}{31304}No, Jerry, I think you're different.
{31313}{31388}You know, to be normal|in the real world...
{31397}{31454}...and to drink Coca-Cola and eat...
{31463}{31504}...Kentucky Fried Chicken...
{31511}{31584}...you got to be in a conspiracy|against yourself.
{31631}{31661}Want to go out sometime?
{31909}{31954}So, what's your horse's name?
{31985}{32014}Johnny Dancer.
{32056}{32125}You've been here a dozen times,|you never asked that before.
{32161}{32222}I was waiting till|I got to know you better.
{32365}{32420}I'd say eight, actually...
{32436}{32466}...times.
{32507}{32554}Times I've been here. Eight.
{32931}{32956}Hey, pal!
{32995}{33045}Don't these water mains|usually go in the wintertime?
{33053}{33110}All I know is it's beaucoup overtime.
{33445}{33472}Feds.
{33479}{33512}No, not Feds.
{33531}{33576}These guys got a purpose.
{33583}{33626}It's government plates.
{33645}{33686}There's something fishy going on.
{33718}{33749}Bet my balls.
{33757}{33814}Here they come.|Camera!
{35443}{35486}Sir, he's in the building now.
{35497}{35582}Spooks! I knew it!
{35661}{35686}Yes, sir.
{36243}{36304}Surprise counts for something.|You're good.
{36310}{36351}You've been watching me a while?
{36358}{36414}I'm told I have eyes|in the back of my head...
{36421}{36488}...but I didn't even|see you guys coming.
{36531}{36573}You must be spooks?|Spooks?
{36580}{36613}CIA spooks, right?
{36626}{36653}Say something.
{36759}{36785}I was right.
{36823}{36848}Right about what?
{36872}{36942}No, I wasn't right.|I was wrong.
{36987}{37075}You guys are from NASA! That's right!|You're from NASA! Come on!
{37082}{37106}No, not the eyes!
{37623}{37644}What?
{37703}{37778}We've been looking for you|a long time.
{37815}{37845}Do I know you?
{37873}{37908}Very well.
{38025}{38053}Have you ever...
{38060}{38133}...been in a place|from which hope is gone?
{38148}{38204}Where all that's left...
{38215}{38250}...is patience?
{38371}{38408}Now, Jerry...
{38429}{38482}...to whom have you been talking?
{38523}{38599}I talk to lots of people.|I drive a cab, you know?
{38606}{38686}- I meet people all day.|- Who else knows what we know?
{38741}{38770}What?
{38789}{38826}What we know, Jerry.
{38833}{38880}What?
{38897}{38916}Tell me what?!
{38923}{38974}What do we know?
{38981}{39092}If I know what we know, I could tell you|what we know and if someone else knows!
{39115}{39164}You got to be more specific.
{39454}{39478}What is that?
{39529}{39574}Gravy for the brain.
{39630}{39652}Not gravy!
{39677}{39707}Please!
{39761}{39815}Not gravy.|No, not gravy!
{39845}{39894}Don't do this to me, please!
{40039}{40072}Now, Jerry...
{40093}{40130}...to whom have you been talking?
{40137}{40180}No, I've had gravy!
{40281}{40301}I know you.
{40326}{40388}You know now, Jerry.|Now you know.
{40395}{40461}- I don't know! Help me!|- Who else knows, Jerry?
{40468}{40494}Who else knows?
{40501}{40545}- Who knows?|- Help me!
{40552}{40612}What do you know?|Who have you been talking to?
{40619}{40658}Help! Help!
{40809}{40880}I know I must share|some of the blame for this.
{40923}{40974}I wish it didn't have to be this way.
{41085}{41126}To whom have you been talking?
{41225}{41273}Who else knows?
{41495}{41522}I believe.
{41529}{41556}I believe!
{41627}{41666}- Who else knows?|- I don't know.
{41725}{41762}Jerry, names!
{41769}{41814}I don't want to dance!
{41821}{41874}To whom have you been talking?
{42231}{42253}Now he knows!
{42267}{42304}Now he knows!
{44087}{44129}He's flying!
{46143}{46185}You wouldn't do this if you knew!
{46192}{46219}Alice!
{46228}{46281}I want to see Alice Sutton!|There she is.
{46288}{46336}There she is. Alice!
{46344}{46407}Alice, this is it!|They tried to...
{46440}{46506}I don't know what they tried,|but I know...
{46513}{46582}I don't know what I know,|but I know that it's big.
{46589}{46619}Will you let me talk?
{46715}{46778}Cut it out, will you?|Get back!
{46790}{46845}Get back.|Please, just give me that gun.
{46852}{46893}And roll it over here.
{46963}{47001}Will you get back?
{47040}{47063}I need to talk to you.
{47070}{47112}You want to talk to me?|Here I am.
{47204}{47225}Get back!
{47278}{47339}I have to tell you something.
{47359}{47413}Why don't you just take it easy?
{47420}{47497}Take it real easy with that, okay?|Just take it easy.
{47523}{47570}You have blood on your shirt.
{47643}{47689}I bit his nose off!
{47726}{47760}You bit somebody's nose off?
{47806}{47893}Don't get in this thing where|you make me repeat myself. I hate that.
{47900}{47921}I'm sorry.
{47928}{47997}Get back,|you dumb complicit sons of bitches!
{48004}{48068}You're looking for a man|with no nose, not me!
{48092}{48136}I need to tell you there was a...
{48143}{48186}...like a fish tank. No goldfish!
{48193}{48257}- And I was in the belly of a whale.|- Just calm down.
{48264}{48307}Wheelchair!|I was crippled and...
{48314}{48377}Look at me. I want you|to put the gun down, please.
{48384}{48458}There was a goldfish.|There wasn't any gravy and I...
{48500}{48537}I don't know what to...
{48544}{48574}Put the gun down.
{48678}{48701}I'm sorry.
{48709}{48738}It's okay.
{48759}{48786}I'm sorry.
{48818}{48863}Okay? Perfect.
{48898}{48936}Take it easy! Take it easy!
{48963}{49030}My God, you're bleeding!|Call an ambulance!
{49053}{49108}A piece of a wheelchair|poked through me.
{49131}{49168}Back away! Back away!
{49179}{49216}Put it away!
{49227}{49284}- Oh, Christ!|- Tell me what happened.
{49299}{49324}I can't.
{49411}{49446}I can't remember.
{49455}{49530}I can't remember them.|I can't remember me.
{49547}{49582}I can remember you.
{49605}{49632}I remember you.
{49687}{49732}It's on the tip of my tongue.
{49827}{49866}I'll remember in the morning.
{49877}{49916}I'm just tired.
{49967}{50034}I just need some sleep.
{50238}{50265}Open.
{50382}{50418}Open, please.
{50481}{50517}She's for you.
{50541}{50588}No, nurse. Don't!
{50598}{50670}What is it? What is it?|I told them...
{50677}{50722}Something to help you sleep.
{50731}{50792}I don't want to sleep,|I want to check out.
{50799}{50886}Why am I handcuffed to this bed?|I'm not a criminal. Please, help!
{50893}{50964}Alice, you get me out of here.|They gave me some stuff.
{50971}{50994}You're under arrest.
{51030}{51067}What's the charge?
{51074}{51125}Jerry, you were there.|Figure it out.
{51134}{51244}Try to remember who stabbed you with|the wheelchair or where it happened.
{51298}{51361}I wish I could explain it|so it all made sense.
{51369}{51416}It's all right. Just relax.
{51458}{51557}You got to switch the charts.|Switch my charts with that guy's charts.
{51577}{51689}Don't make me repeat myself. Switch|my chart or I'll be dead by morning.
{51702}{51767}Relax. Go to sleep.|I will see you tomorrow.
{51774}{51830}- You want to bet?|- You're just being paranoid.
{51837}{51875}Only because they want me dead.
{51882}{51944}Please, Alice.|Please, save my life.
{51981}{52010}Switch them.
{52056}{52095}Switch the charts.
{52959}{52998}Could you open this,|please, ma'am?
{53050}{53073}What happened?
{53080}{53160}Guy came in with a stab wound|and died of a heart attack.
{53276}{53299}You Miss Sutton?
{53309}{53358}They want me to bring you downstairs.
{53373}{53396}Who does?
{53405}{53502}The FBI, the CIA. You name|the initials, they're down there.
{53509}{53549}Any special reason?
{53556}{53613}They said to bring you|and the body to the basement.
{53620}{53679}And the body's on its way,|so come with me.
{53732}{53776}I just need one minute, please.
{54045}{54071}Thank you.
{54121}{54143}For what?
{54177}{54223}For switching the charts.
{54236}{54287}I didn't switch the charts.
{54309}{54412}It's okay. The guy traded bullets|with an old man in a liquor store.
{54419}{54450}He had it coming.
{54460}{54538}You expect me to believe|that someone came in here last night...
{54545}{54601}...and gave him something|to stop his heart?
{54624}{54675}You switched the charts,|you tell me.
{54800}{54887}I've got to go downstairs.|The CIA wants to see your body.
{54968}{55036}I won't be here when you get back.|I'll keep in touch.
{55048}{55101}You're handcuffed to the bed.
{55108}{55190}I'll have to chew through my arm.|It's better than hospital food.
{55256}{55279}Thank you.
{55408}{55446}You saved my life.|Thank you.
{55515}{55550}Heart attacks happen.
{55628}{55671}I didn't switch the charts.
{55711}{55743}Yeah, you did.
{55751}{55827}You switched them.|You switched the charts.
{55892}{55967}Let's see here.|This is a grueling experience.
{56116}{56146}Put that out!
{56153}{56231}There's a government man now.|This is Miss Sutton.
{56239}{56290}Miss Sutton, Agent Lowry, FBI.
{56303}{56372}We're waiting for jurisdictional|problems to be cleared.
{56379}{56428}- Fletcher's something else.|- Tell me about it!
{56435}{56512}Police want him for assault.|Secret Service for counterfeiting.
{56519}{56574}We want him for a string|of bank robberies.
{56581}{56634}No one knows|what the CIA wants him for.
{56696}{56720}This CIA shrink...
{56727}{56797}...is here to I.D. Fletcher.|They knew each other somehow.
{56804}{56831}Take off the sheet.
{56884}{56942}- This isn't him.|- The chart says "Jerry Fletcher."
{57079}{57128}- He's...|- He's what?
{57234}{57277}He's having a heart attack!
{57294}{57335}Where's that goddamn cop?
{57368}{57407}Get a crash cart in here, stat!
{57529}{57583}- A dog bit it.|- Excuse me?
{57593}{57706}You were going to ask about my nose.|Poor animal is to be destroyed today.
{57713}{57780}- And you feel bad for it?|- It's my dog.
{57825}{57867}Oh, no! I'm sorry.
{57909}{57933}Nurse!
{57965}{58003}There he goes!
{58032}{58107}- Open the goddamn gate!|- No, and you watch your language!
{58149}{58188}FBI, lady!|Open the damn door!
{58492}{58512}Hi, Alice.
{58540}{58568}You never saw me.
{58651}{58670}Shut up!
{58677}{58700}There he goes!
{58752}{58786}Lady, open the damn door!
{58793}{58847}Open the gate!|Will you open it?!
{58980}{59021}You! Get hospital security.
{59028}{59080}- Block all exits.|- Yes sir. Let's go!
{59092}{59147}Is this guy a psychiatrist|or a field agent?
{59628}{59696}You want to put your foot down|and get out of there?
{59713}{59743}Come on, buddy.
{59753}{59827}If you only knew|what really happened to Serpico...
{59835}{59882}...you'd be helping me out right now.
{59891}{59912}Get out of there!
{59965}{59992}Come on, now!
{59999}{60046}Give me a break.|I'm wounded.
{60053}{60083}Hands behind your back!
{60189}{60228}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
{60919}{60961}He said a dog bit his nose.
{61027}{61092}You got to help me out of this,|Alice, please.
{61099}{61136}I can't make any promises.
{61143}{61178}I'm in a tight spot here.
{61259}{61295}You look really pretty today.
{61313}{61360}Your eyes look kind of different.
{61367}{61422}Please, Alice, make an exception.
{61523}{61576}Please. Alice, are you there?
{61585}{61642}Come back.|Please, don't leave me here.
{61751}{61778}Thank you.
{61809}{61835}There we go.
{62451}{62476}Have you seen him?
{62483}{62569}- No. Did you see him?|- No way to shut this place down quick.
{62575}{62678}You have a half-naked man chained|to a bed rail. Just block the exits.
{62707}{62729}Good idea.
{62751}{62804}Will you keep me company, please?
{63265}{63298}- David?|- Carl.
{63305}{63392}I'm sorry, Carl. Dr. Fine.|I want your advice about something.
{63399}{63484}I had a middle-aged guy,|operate on his gallstones...
{63491}{63590}- Do I know you?|- Of course. Dr. Fine, proctology.
{63615}{63704}So Jerry thinks that NASA is plotting|to kill the President?
{63711}{63746}You already asked me that.
{63753}{63814}And you have no idea|where Jerry lives?
{63821}{63906}You've asked me that 3 times.|Why keep making me repeat myself?
{63913}{63958}All right, here's a fresh one.
{63997}{64026}Why you?
{64035}{64140}Your colleague, Mr. Wilson, tells me|Jerry won't talk to anyone but you.
{64147}{64190}That seems...
{64207}{64270}...oddly possessive behavior to me.
{64293}{64338}I'm sorry, what was the question?
{64347}{64410}Why do you insist on|having me repeat myself?
{64493}{64518}Why...
{64525}{64550}...you?
{64647}{64682}I think he has a crush on me.
{64700}{64731}How charming.
{64745}{64775}He has great taste.
{64797}{64823}Now, why him?
{64831}{64903}Why do you tolerate|his visits to your office?
{64959}{65067}About 6 months ago, I was leaving work|and 2 guys tried to mug me.
{65081}{65161}Jerry came out of nowhere|and rescued me. That's how I met him.
{65224}{65326}He probably is crazy, but|there's something about Jerry that...
{65433}{65458}I don't know.
{65483}{65542}I don't have the heart|to tell him to get lost.
{65549}{65601}I didn't know the CIA had psychiatrists.
{65633}{65677}We're very specialized.
{65720}{65739}May I?
{65865}{65895}Veritas.
{65917}{65944}Truth.
{65984}{66031}What is it they say about truth?
{66049}{66099}The truth will set you free.
{66909}{66945}"Catcher in the Rye."
{66964}{67025}Chapman had that book|when he shot John Lennon.
{67049}{67084}I was just thinking that.
{67103}{67164}Remember the guy that shot Reagan?|John Hinckley?
{67171}{67233}They found a copy of that book|in his apartment.
{67311}{67360}Weird coincidence.
{67393}{67432}Thanks for your input, officer.
{67515}{67534}Gum...
{67547}{67578}...keys...
{67595}{67622}...and a book.
{67695}{67716}Car.
{67737}{67770}Maybe apartment.
{67828}{67851}This one's odd.
{67868}{67922}What do you think?|It's got paint on it.
{68003}{68035}Safety deposit box key.
{68058}{68077}I'll take that.
{68101}{68126}And that.
{68256}{68283}You're welcome.
{68303}{68334}Spooks!
{68407}{68450}What do you say we...
{68467}{68534}...I don't know,|compare notes on this guy?
{68728}{68747}"Geronimo"?
{68920}{68957}No, don't!
{68964}{68987}Let me have the ticket.
{69007}{69052}No, I'm here, I'm here!
{69077}{69155}- There's a "no parking" sign there.|- I see it.
{69163}{69246}- Two cops to give a ticket now?|- These days it takes 2 cops.
{69519}{69586}I'm sorry.|I didn't mean to frighten you.
{69592}{69656}Tickets have been coming all day.|Didn't know what to do.
{69663}{69748}- How'd you know this was my car?|- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.
{69755}{69820}I feel kind of naked.|Could we get out of here?
{69827}{69920}- Don't tell me you're naked.|- It's a figure of speech. Can we go?
{69931}{69968}Please. Hurry.
{69979}{70024}People are looking everywhere.
{70257}{70308}What took you so long?|I was here all day.
{70315}{70402}It takes time to search a hospital.|A lot of people are after you.
{70409}{70523}They'll put me in the same place as|Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.
{70537}{70614}Oswald killed the President.|Is that what you're planning?
{70621}{70674}No. Did you call him|about the earthquake?
{70681}{70706}I'll do that.
{70713}{70816}- Can you sit up so I can see you?|- No. I don't want them to see me.
{70823}{70840}Them who?
{70847}{70938}Them back there. Change lanes.|Watch the rearview mirror.
{70945}{70988}It's a fun experiment.
{71363}{71426}Did you see it?|Wraparound headlights?
{71441}{71507}Crown Victoria?|FBI. It's a legitimate tail.
{71537}{71565}As opposed to?
{71585}{71631}As opposed to serious people.
{71643}{71750}Can you drive this thing,|or do you just like looking good in it?
{71759}{71834}I suppose you think I should speed up|and try to lose them.
{71859}{71907}It's what a man would do.|I'm not a man.
{71929}{71950}I noticed.
{71957}{71987}What are you doing?
{72349}{72372}Agent Lowry.
{72401}{72432}It wasn't my idea.
{72439}{72468}Jonas?
{72495}{72532}It's his show for now.
{72593}{72631}You want to get dinner?
{72671}{72718}Interagency cooperation and all?
{72775}{72830}When I'm ready to compare notes,|I'll tell you.
{72837}{72864}It's your call.
{72891}{72915}Good night.
{73040}{73146}See? Wasn't that easier than squealing|tires and knocking over trash cans?
{73153}{73183}Nothing's easy.
{73195}{73234}You know that guy they arrested in...
{73241}{73283}How long have we known each other?
{73311}{73374}Six months and 11 days.
{73415}{73460}Six months and 11 days.
{73481}{73524}I'll give you one more hour.
{73535}{73562}Where to?
{73801}{73858}Why did we have to go down|to go back up?
{73927}{74016}'Cause I don't like to come|and go in the same way twice.
{74023}{74098}I just live in there. I have to get...
{74367}{74422}- Here, you should have this.|- What is it?
{74429}{74498}It's my union pin.|I figured, the way you drove...
{74511}{74570}...you should be in the union.
{74591}{74674}I'd be proud to have you|drive me around in a cab.
{74731}{74760}Come in, please.
{74777}{74828}Give me those.|I'll put them up.
{74849}{74910}Let me shut the door.|Sorry there's not more room in here.
{74917}{74954}My keys!
{74971}{75006}I'll just get the light.
{75133}{75168}The Jerry Garcia file.
{75175}{75226}I didn't...|Yes, I did!
{75235}{75310}You know why The Grateful Dead|are always on tour?
{75325}{75436}Because they're all British agents,|intelligence agents. They're spies.
{75475}{75560}Jerry Garcia himself has|a double-0 rating, just like James Bond.
{75575}{75616}Jerry Garcia's dead.
{75642}{75689}That's what they want you to think.
{75719}{75794}Is this supposed to protect you|from aliens or something?
{75801}{75838}No, it's just a beer bottle.
{75857}{75884}Follow me.
{75895}{75938}Come into my humble abode.
{75957}{75980}Here we go.
{76075}{76098}Welcome.
{76177}{76214}Want something to drink?
{76243}{76270}Coffee...
{76283}{76310}...if that's okay.
{76317}{76362}No, coffee's our friend.
{76373}{76426}Coffee's our friend.|It's fine.
{76779}{76874}I keep the beans in the fridge.|Keeps them fresher, makes better coffee.
{76918}{76973}Papa Leoni told me that.
{76989}{77032}He's dead now.|Nice old guy.
{77371}{77406}"I love the delicate shadow...
{77491}{77534}...of she wanting me to be."
{77555}{77640}I can't seem to remember|this combination. Want some juice?
{78251}{78292}If my universe had a hub...
{78299}{78318}This would be it?
{78374}{78397}Here.
{78437}{78468}"In the Irons"?
{78475}{78563}Yeah, I've been reading up|on it lately. Equitation.
{78571}{78603}Are these yours?
{78747}{78804}But I think this is|what's been causing the problem.
{78811}{78918}This is the third issue this year.|I give you "Conspiracy Theory."
{78941}{78976}This is my newsletter.
{78987}{79028}I think it's got them scared.
{79040}{79123}I must have hit a nerve|with one of those articles in there.
{79130}{79177}They're pissed off about something.
{79209}{79268}"The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret"?
{79317}{79388}"The Oliver Stone-George Bush|Connection"? Oliver Stone?
{79423}{79482}Sure. I mean, he's their spokesman.
{79539}{79612}You think if anyone|had the information that he's got...
{79619}{79702}...and had a podium to shout|it from, they'd actually let him do it?
{79709}{79784}No, it's quite clear that|he's a disinformation junkie for him.
{79833}{79908}That he's still alive says it all.|He should be dead.
{79945}{79983}Can you prove any of this?
{80029}{80128}No. Absolutely not.|A good conspiracy is unprovable.
{80237}{80296}If you can prove it,|they screwed up somewhere.
{80303}{80342}And if that's the case...
{80351}{80372}They?
{80379}{80402}They!
{80451}{80478}They who?
{80525}{80592}"They who"? I don't know.
{80599}{80666}That's why they call them "they."|And "them."
{80727}{80760}Where does Jonas fit in?
{80767}{80872}He's one of "they." He's one of them.|He's them. For sure.
{80881}{80928}They. Them.
{80977}{81018}They must have a secret handshake.
{81437}{81460}That's it?
{81497}{81569}No. How would I know?|I'm not one of them.
{81576}{81611}I'm just horsing around.
{81687}{81723}How many subscribers?
{81741}{81782}Let's see.
{81875}{81898}Five.
{81948}{82028}But I think it's probably got|something to do with the economy.
{82085}{82138}You think one of them|is not who they seem?
{82169}{82214}You think it might be one of they?
{82229}{82288}That could be.|Of course!
{82304}{82329}You have a list?
{82377}{82418}A subscriber's list?
{82429}{82472}Yes, right over here.
{82531}{82600}I thought you meant|some other kind of...
{82775}{82820}Big Holden Caulfield fan?
{82999}{83024}Not really.
{83031}{83071}You just like the story?
{83155}{83202}Not especially, no.
{83223}{83286}You've got a dozen copies|of this book.
{83311}{83336}I know.
{83363}{83388}I know.
{83484}{83522}There's more of them in here.
{83589}{83624}Under the bed too.
{83665}{83734}I don't know why,|but whenever I see one...
{83743}{83778}...I have to buy it.
{83841}{83878}And if I don't see one...
{83885}{83932}...then I have to find one...
{83939}{83968}...to buy...
{83977}{84016}...so I can feel normal.
{84165}{84201}I don't know why.
{84227}{84266}Did you ever read it?
{84347}{84402}Yeah, you read this in school.
{84409}{84470}No one ever gave it to me|to read at school.
{84477}{84530}That's what they start|when you're young.
{84537}{84640}When you're little, at school,|they Baden-Powell all the boys and...
{84647}{84699}...they Betty Crocker all the girls.
{84711}{84752}Then they air condition you.
{84759}{84838}And they put you in an Easy Bake Oven|and you can't breathe anymore.
{84903}{84942}You must think I'm crazy.
{84991}{85027}Yeah, right!
{85099}{85150}4, 23...
{85159}{85182}...12.
{85279}{85372}That's the combination of the coffee.|Do you still want some?
{85523}{85568}You idiot!
{85737}{85768}We're made. Gas them.
{85861}{85896}Go! Tear gas!
{85903}{85932}Don't breathe!
{86031}{86082}- Delta team, are you secure?|- Delta team, secure.
{86217}{86242}Take it down!
{86441}{86466}Clear!
{86515}{86542}On top of the bed!
{86661}{86708}Move it! Come on!
{87109}{87164}- Are you coming?|- I'm right behind you.
{87347}{87380}Close your eyes.
{87389}{87412}What are you doing?!
{87421}{87448}Torching my hub!
{87951}{87980}What is that?
{87989}{88040}That was here when I moved in.
{88423}{88484}- What are you doing?|- Always be prepared.
{88561}{88616}Get out now! Go!
{88819}{88873}The fire's two flights up on the left.
{88880}{88908}Excuse me.
{88943}{88975}Clear a path.
{88999}{89040}Is that who I think it was?
{89047}{89096}Has this ever happened before?
{89103}{89153}No, but I've been practicing.|Let's go.
{89160}{89195}Who are you?
{89235}{89275}I'm a guy putting out a fire.
{89304}{89320}Let's go.
{89384}{89455}See this aluminum-looking stuff?|It's firewall.
{89484}{89567}It's amazing. The guy designed it|so it could be an incinerator...
{89587}{89646}...leaving the rest|of the building untouched.
{89664}{89698}Dr. Jonas.
{89747}{89789}Something else you should see.
{89796}{89830}I want to hear more.
{89844}{89885}Let's go. Wrap it up.
{89979}{90007}You mind?
{90584}{90606}In one hour...
{90613}{90707}...tell me how she eats, she sleeps,|her kindergarten teacher's name.
{90788}{90849}- Home, safe and sound.|- It only looks safe.
{90855}{90912}- You can't stay here.|- They're not after me!
{90919}{90964}Don't turn the lights on.
{90973}{91038}I can stay here with you,|I can sleep on your couch.
{91045}{91100}- Don't turn the lights on.|- You're going, okay?
{91107}{91150}- I don't want to go.|- You're going!
{91157}{91188}I want to ask you something.
{91195}{91262}Ask me to stay.|I could sleep in the bathtub.
{91272}{91318}- You can't be here alone.|- Shut up.
{91325}{91367}Get down!
{91391}{91422}What are you doing now?
{91429}{91508}You don't want to be seen here.|Always make sure these are shut.
{91515}{91596}Please, just be still, be quiet.|Listen to me, okay?
{91603}{91651}I think we can make some progress...
{91659}{91754}...if you just answer|one question to my satisfaction.
{91761}{91783}I'll try.
{91832}{91907}It's about the painting|on the wall in your apartment.
{91947}{92046}I didn't mean for you to see that.|It's like looking in someone's diary...
{92053}{92123}...and taking it all out of context.
{92149}{92170}That's fair.
{92177}{92207}It's just that...
{92251}{92366}...it was so big and you obviously put|a lot of time into it and you seem to...
{92379}{92404}...know me so well.
{92411}{92450}How is that possible?
{92471}{92513}So, what's the question?
{92536}{92578}How is that possible?
{92644}{92690}This is you and your dad.|He was...
{92697}{92770}...murdered, right? He was that judge.|It was in the paper.
{92777}{92819}Did they ever find out...
{92827}{92868}...how, who did it?
{92875}{92935}You don't mind me asking you?
{92992}{93042}You're changing the subject.
{93123}{93166}He's why you punish yourself?
{93173}{93202}Please, don't start.
{93209}{93280}You get on the treadmill,|turn your back to that picture...
{93287}{93324}...like you're running away.
{93331}{93392}Sometimes you sing|with the music...
{93399}{93452}...but most of the time,|you punish yourself.
{93459}{93538}I don't know where you get|the energy after a full day's work.
{93545}{93626}- You run like a maniac. Why?|- What are you talking about? Music?
{93633}{93697}What are you talking about?|Are you watching me?
{93704}{93738}What do you do?|Sit in your car?
{93745}{93794}Do you wait in an alleyway?|Every day?
{93801}{93874}- It's not like...|- What is it? Tell me what it is!
{93881}{93968}- You don't ride your horse...|- Don't change the subject! Get out!
{93975}{94044}I will give you $100|to get out of my house.
{94051}{94115}I don't need any money.|I got plenty for a rainy day.
{94135}{94170}Guess what?
{94196}{94266}- It's pouring out.|- All right, you're tired.
{94287}{94334}Just don't be mad at me, okay?
{94444}{94523}Use your dead bolts, Alice.|Okay? Just lock up.
{95060}{95106}I'm going to empty my bladder.
{95888}{95946}- How's your bladder?|- I got to go. How's yours?
{95953}{96003}No, don't do that.
{96079}{96122}A lot of folks are looking for you.
{96144}{96210}I guess that makes you|the smart one.
{96247}{96290}Put your hands on the wheel.
{96328}{96370}Both your hands on the wheel.
{96377}{96396}Thank you.
{96403}{96422}You're welcome.
{96429}{96455}Don't mention it.
{96471}{96503}Where's my partner?
{96511}{96531}Who?
{96555}{96584}He's okay.
{96600}{96675}But you got a gun to your head|asking how your partner is.
{96692}{96727}You might be okay.
{96752}{96808}He'll have a headache|a couple of days.
{96828}{96869}Are your intentions honorable?
{96899}{96935}I'm not sure what you mean.
{96991}{97047}With Alice. I mean...
{97059}{97107}Think of me as her guardian angel.
{97135}{97231}That's ironic because we're here|to protect her from you.
{97292}{97395}No, you're here because you thought|I'd show up, so that's why you're here.
{97427}{97482}Seemed like a possibility.
{97507}{97563}What about your intentions?|Are they...
{97572}{97599}...honorable?
{97624}{97647}Yeah.
{97659}{97698}I'm not a violent man.
{97715}{97740}By nature...
{97747}{97824}...I'm not a violent man,|Mr. Lowry.
{97831}{97886}But if you hurt Alice in any way...
{97893}{97954}...or anything like that, I'll kill you.
{98011}{98059}Does that seem honorable enough?
{98072}{98115}Well, maybe.
{98388}{98430}Are you pretending?
{98464}{98503}Yes, yes...
{98567}{98594}Sorry.
{98601}{98647}It's got to be here.
{99020}{99047}Thank God!
{99172}{99207}May I help you, sir?
{99264}{99318}- I need to scan it.|- Put it through.
{99325}{99346}No, this side.
{99353}{99379}I'll do it.
{99631}{99687}Bingo! "Catcher in the Rye."
{99696}{99783}Location is 33 East 17th Street,|Barnes and Noble.
{99820}{99850}Where's...?
{99871}{99926}- I'm putting it in a bag.|- I don't want one.
{100307}{100352}I got the exact change for you.
{100359}{100398}Make life easy for you.
{100600}{100627}Your receipt.
{100644}{100672}Thank you.
{100695}{100732}"Catcher in the Rye."
{100739}{100782}It's a classic.
{100789}{100819}Have you read it?
{100851}{100890}- Never read it.|- Never?
{100897}{100967}No, I haven't.|I never read it.
{101195}{101234}We're going silent, guys.
{101363}{101397}Confirm silent.
{101579}{101618}Could I have a pretzel?
{103709}{103732}I got him.
{103947}{103970}There he is.
{104084}{104107}Just one.
{104184}{104211}Hurry up.
{105576}{105626}Bomb!|There's a bomb under my seat!
{105939}{106020}Be calm! Remain calm|and move out in an orderly fashion!
{106645}{106674}There he is!
{107097}{107128}I'm not sorry.
{107140}{107172}Leave me alone, will you?
{108885}{108935}I'm turning into a Jerry.
{110194}{110230}I've got a cease and desist...
{110237}{110278}...on Jerry Fletcher matters.
{110285}{110366}We're not to discuss him with the press,|NYPD, or anyone else.
{110385}{110446}Building security|is arresting him on sight...
{110453}{110532}...and we're to report any attempt|he makes to contact you.
{110549}{110616}I don't like it.|Something's not right here.
{110625}{110702}Dr. Jonas thought you might be|inclined not to cooperate.
{110712}{110735}Why is that?
{110789}{110850}We don't know who Dr. Jonas is.
{110857}{110899}Nor who we're cooperating with.
{110916}{110973}I've had many credentials|flashed in my face.
{110980}{111044}And after yesterday,|I know not to ask questions.
{111064}{111106}We're out.|We're shut off.
{111113}{111143}We're terminated.
{111193}{111224}Understood?
{111316}{111347}Understood.
{111740}{111787}They can't see|the trees for the forest.
{112065}{112137}Hi, may I speak|with Mr. Ketcham, please?
{112144}{112181}This is Mrs. Ketcham.
{112188}{112262}Hello, Mrs. Ketcham.|Your husband receives our newsletter.
{112269}{112338}Would he like to renew|his subscription?
{112345}{112444}My husband is dead. He was killed|last night in a car accident.
{112808}{112851}These just came for you.
{112880}{112927}- Want a vase?|- Yes, please.
{112997}{113084}"Go out the building to the right.|Take the first bus."
{113297}{113366}Tell Jill I'm expecting|a call from Milwaukee.
{113373}{113427}- Transfer my calls to my mobile.|- Will do.
{113640}{113663}Got her.
{113721}{113768}Subject is on the move.
{114348}{114378}She's on the bus. Go!
{114385}{114434}Subject on bus 1648.
{114441}{114472}Will follow.
{114792}{114818}What the hell?
{114825}{114854}Keep going!
{115520}{115581}- Like a Roadrunner cartoon. See that?|- No, what?
{115588}{115660}You didn't see it?|Nobody ever sees what I see.
{115677}{115736}Where did you get|your five subscribers?
{115761}{115840}Bulletin board, through library|computers so it couldn't be traced.
{115856}{115898}They're dead.|4 out of 5 of them.
{115905}{115949}I checked.|All in the last 24 hours.
{115956}{116002}1 accident,|2 heart attacks, a stroke.
{116009}{116057}This one I can't reach.|Henry Finch.
{116064}{116093}They're dead.
{116100}{116132}I did that.
{116161}{116226}Heart attacks and strokes, it's CIA.|Henry Finch!
{116233}{116263}Oh, my God!
{116305}{116338}I should've realized.
{116345}{116390}They monitor absolutely everything.
{116397}{116438}Elaborate on "they." They?
{116445}{116470}They?
{116477}{116534}There's lots of groups, actually.|Lots of initials.
{116541}{116624}CIA. FBI. IMF, you name it.
{116633}{116694}They are part of the same|two opposing factions.
{116701}{116731}Which are?
{116802}{116857}Some of them are very wealthy families.
{116864}{116934}Their goal is to maintain stability.|That's what they say.
{116941}{117011}The other is Eisenhower's|industrial-military complex.
{117018}{117073}And they want instability,|so they say.
{117080}{117147}So you're saying group one|is warring with group two?
{117154}{117218}At some levels. But at others,|it's the same group.
{117225}{117285}Scary! It's hand and glove.|Cold wars, hot wars.
{117292}{117337}They sit and watch the whole show.
{117344}{117367}Take a breath.
{117428}{117535}The latest casualty in the whole fiasco|is one of America's richest men:
{117545}{117584}Ernest Harriman.
{117621}{117646}He was murdered.
{117653}{117686}- Murdered?|- Here in Manhattan.
{117693}{117746}I read in the paper...
{117753}{117837}...he drowned in a swimming pool.|It was an accident, in Newport.
{117844}{117935}Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't|even kill Sunny Von Bulow there.
{117941}{117981}He drowned,|but not in Newport.
{117988}{118015}Where, then?
{118095}{118148}Here, at the 7th Street|subway station.
{118155}{118244}A billionaire on the subway?|Why didn't they drown him in his limo?
{118251}{118318}Don't you read the papers?|Don't you watch TV?
{118331}{118378}Last week,|this place was under water.
{118385}{118430}- A water main broke.|- I know.
{118437}{118512}You know what's above this area?|The Harriman Building.
{118519}{118604}The whole substructure was flooded.|He didn't drown in a pool.
{118611}{118684}Call the coroner|in Rhode Island or wherever it was...
{118691}{118740}...and ask if he had chlorine|in his lungs.
{118747}{118788}- Okay, I will.|- You will?
{118799}{118829}If you want, I would.
{118836}{118885}I don't know what to say.|I love you.
{118917}{118940}What?
{119007}{119060}It's like I resolved to...
{119069}{119117}...call you up 1,000 times a day...
{119147}{119182}...ask you if you'll marry me...
{119197}{119242}...in some old-fashioned way.
{119283}{119330}Everything you do is magic.
{119399}{119443}Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
{119481}{119533}Yeah, I know that.
{119611}{119704}I'm nervous. I reached out and|grabbed the first thing I could think...
{119711}{119804}I know they're song lyrics,|but I know how I feel...
{119823}{119902}I think you're confused.|It's been a long day.
{119915}{119987}You wanted to know...|that picture on the wall.
{120017}{120046}We shouldn't talk about it.
{120053}{120092}Yes, we should.|It's Geronimo.
{120099}{120162}That's love.|And love gives you insight.
{120169}{120236}Love lets you see things|that you wouldn't normally...
{120251}{120343}I just know that I've loved you|since the first time I saw you.
{120396}{120425}You don't love me.
{120432}{120459}Sure I do.
{120481}{120500}I don't?
{120664}{120713}I thought that...|Well, I thought...
{120720}{120767}I just thought that maybe...
{121197}{121264}I'm sorry.|Jerry, I'm sorry.
{121731}{121800}We have a call|from the Milwaukee post office.
{121811}{121894}The mail for Henry Finch|is being forwarded here to Manhattan.
{121909}{121932}Where?
{121939}{122012}Foley Square.|The Criminal Courts Building.
{122699}{122744}I'd like to see Mr. Finch, please.
{122751}{122812}- Who?|- Henry Finch.
{122825}{122864}Is he expecting you?
{122876}{122971}I'm Sutton with the Justice Department.|I want to see Mr. Finch immediately.
{123487}{123524}He'll be right with you.
{123835}{123882}What the hell is going on here?
{123889}{123946}I'm very impressed, Alice.
{123981}{124033}How's Jerry this morning?
{124040}{124074}A more important question is:
{124081}{124114}Who are you?
{124137}{124196}Those are bigger questions|than you think.
{124249}{124280}Please sit down.
{124535}{124588}For reasons that will soon be...
{124607}{124683}...regrettably clear,|I'm going to tell you a secret.
{124717}{124784}Then you can judge|what and who I am.
{124803}{124829}Years ago...
{124837}{124914}...I worked for|the Central Intelligence Agency...
{124921}{125007}...on the MK ULTRA program.|You familiar with it?
{125032}{125074}It was mind control.
{125081}{125131}"Manchurian Candidate" kind of stuff.
{125159}{125215}That's a vulgar generalization.
{125240}{125298}But yes, you take an ordinary man...
{125305}{125353}...and turn him into an assassin.
{125360}{125393}That was our goal.
{125436}{125520}MK ULTRA was terminated in 1973.
{125538}{125566}But...
{125587}{125620}...not the...
{125628}{125662}...the research.
{125674}{125713}That, I continued.
{125774}{125810}Shall I go on?
{125867}{125924}"The truth will set you free."
{126023}{126100}It involved hallucinogenic research...
{126127}{126218}...electroshock to induce|vegetative states...
{126239}{126295}...terminal experiments|in sensory deprivation.
{126304}{126333}Terminal?
{126348}{126391}As in, "resulting in death."
{126579}{126630}I'm now trying to pay my penance.
{126669}{126751}These things that you're talking about,|you did them to Jerry?
{126796}{126907}MK ULTRA was science,|sanctioned by the government.
{126960}{126986}It all ended...
{126993}{127051}...the moment John Hinckley|shot Ronald Reagan.
{127185}{127235}No, that wasn't us.
{127268}{127318}But the technology had been stolen.
{127348}{127404}Pandora's box opened.
{127441}{127532}My subjects were taken from me,|used in the private sector.
{127545}{127583}Jerry was one of them.
{127613}{127660}One of your subjects.
{127681}{127754}It is imperative that I discover|who stole the technology.
{127793}{127875}Alice, I will do what is necessary...
{127892}{127972}...to stimulate Jerry|into telling me what he knows.
{128020}{128072}Jerry is very dangerous.
{128192}{128236}Jerry has killed.
{128487}{128529}To find who programmed Jerry...
{128536}{128628}...I have to find Jerry,|but I can't do that without you.
{129060}{129096}Do you recognize this?
{129268}{129303}Where did you get that?
{129312}{129352}You do recognize it, then?
{129385}{129420}Of course I do.
{129444}{129508}It belonged to my father.|Where did you get it?
{129565}{129632}What do you know|about your father's death?
{129700}{129784}He denied a man in prison|appeal for a new trial.
{129796}{129835}Ezekiel Walters.
{129844}{129928}Walters had nothing to do|with your father's murder.
{129973}{130084}They found him holding his wallet.|The only thing missing was this photo.
{130092}{130131}Where did you find it?
{130208}{130358}Jerry's safe deposit box.
{130365}{130428}When do you think Jerry|first took notice of you?
{130437}{130499}What is it the two|of you have in common?
{130556}{130610}I was mugged and he saved me.
{130617}{130707}He may have saved you,|but that was no coincidence.
{130716}{130784}Come on, you're a lawyer.|You think like one.
{130816}{130880}Your father was assassinated.
{130975}{131075}And the sick son of a bitch|has been obsessed with you ever since.
{131365}{131423}I am so sorry, Alice.
{131441}{131484}I truly am.
{132250}{132281}Miss Sutton?
{132302}{132341}Hold on one second.
{132398}{132441}Alice, you order pizza?
{132480}{132507}Hold it.
{132858}{132894}"Go to the northeast corner...
{132901}{132947}...of Greenwich and Battery Place.
{132955}{133031}Bring the pizza.|I have something important to tell you."
{133144}{133229}Call Bill in Security|and tell him Fletcher's in the area.
{133260}{133333}"I have something|important to tell you."
{133402}{133470}I have tried everything|I know to get Jerry to talk.
{133487}{133517}Would you try?
{133524}{133582}I promise you,|you'll be perfectly safe.
{133592}{133623}No way.
{133644}{133689}You don't have to do this.
{133816}{133837}I will.
{133844}{133875}Good girl!
{133890}{133949}I want a bug in this box,|audio and track.
{134170}{134201}That still hot?
{134208}{134269}Hop in. Doesn't pay|to stand around too long.
{134940}{134989}This is 42-K.|We're on him.
{135114}{135146}Thanks.
{135153}{135183}I'm starving.
{135262}{135292}This is good.
{135300}{135329}Have some.
{135441}{135501}- Do you have him on that?|- We still got him.
{135511}{135536}You okay?
{135568}{135660}No, you're not. I shouldn't have said|all that stuff I said before.
{135697}{135784}I won't do that anymore.|I'm sorry. I can't help how I feel.
{135792}{135845}What did you want to talk to me about?
{135898}{135996}I can feel what I... I mean,|I can think... no, I can feel...
{136003}{136081}...what I want to say,|but I can't get it out.
{136120}{136191}I've heard enough.|Stop the car. I want her out of there.
{136202}{136223}Keep driving.
{136232}{136265}It's kind of like...
{136272}{136375}...if you sing along to the music|you know the words with the music.
{136382}{136424}But with no music,|you're helpless.
{136450}{136501}I don 't understand.|Is something wrong?
{136508}{136567}No. Don 't worry about it.
{136581}{136637}I want to take you|where the music's playing.
{136644}{136690}The music is playing in Queens?
{136714}{136743}No, not today.
{136772}{136813}- Did she say Queens?|- Yes.
{136820}{136871}This is air unit one.|We've lost visual.
{136878}{136957}He's on the lower level.|We'll pick him up on the other side.
{137240}{137285}- Where is he?|- Straight ahead.
{137316}{137353}About 300 yards.
{137439}{137475}- What?|- Nothing.
{137488}{137519}You see something?
{137570}{137595}Hang on.
{137616}{137667}What are you doing?
{137700}{137721}Let's go.
{137728}{137750}The pizza!
{137779}{137817}Leave the pizza.
{137824}{137866}I'll get you another pizza.
{137896}{137930}- What's this?|- He stopped.
{137984}{138037}I have to go back and get the pizza.
{138060}{138105}It'll all make sense in a minute.
{138112}{138149}Stop, stop, stop!
{138166}{138201}This is ours. Hop in.
{138214}{138271}All mobile units watch him.|What do you see?
{138278}{138321}Just slide across.
{138924}{138973}Air unit one, what do you see?
{138980}{139075}We see no traffic.|We'll go down and take a look.
{139518}{139607}They have exited the vehicle.|The pizza box is still in the car.
{139836}{139883}Where are we going?
{139900}{139927}Connecticut.
{139942}{140047}We shut the bridge down.|All off-ramps. Both levels. Got it?
{140060}{140115}Roger that.|I'll take the west end.
{140350}{140387}Where are we going?
{140428}{140457}You hear it?
{140506}{140539}The music,|I almost hear it.
{140602}{140633}I almost hear it.
{140648}{140673}We will.
{140708}{140731}We will.
{141328}{141373}Mr. Wilson's office.
{141382}{141406}Hello?
{141551}{141573}David Berkowitz.
{141598}{141659}Ted Bundy. Richard Speck.
{141732}{141759}What about them?
{141784}{141821}Serial killers.
{141850}{141917}They only have two names.|You ever notice that?
{141934}{141981}But lone gunman assassins...
{141988}{142073}...they always have three names.|John Wilkes Booth.
{142080}{142129}Lee Harvey Oswald.|Mark David Chapman.
{142140}{142195}John Hinckley shot Reagan.|He only has two.
{142288}{142367}Yeah, but he only shot Reagan.|Reagan didn't die.
{142374}{142427}If Reagan had died,|I'm pretty sure...
{142434}{142523}...we probably would all know|what John Hinckley's middle name was.
{142788}{142831}Mr. Wilson's office.
{142930}{142995}It's her. The line's open.|Get a trace on it.
{143006}{143063}- Hot one! Line three trace.|- A cell trace.
{143452}{143479}This is my father's place.
{143556}{143603}This is where the music's playing.
{144048}{144085}I just thought of another one.
{144098}{144163}James Earl Ray.|The guy that got Luther King.
{144191}{144266}Then there's Sirhan Sirhan.|I haven't figured that out.
{144273}{144339}Maybe it's Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan.
{144346}{144408}Here we got the stables|and the house is over there.
{144415}{144470}I guess I should just follow my nose.
{144619}{144658}What's your middle name, Jerry?
{144665}{144698}What do you mean?
{144714}{144776}- Did you kill my father?|- No.
{144881}{144900}Maybe.
{144922}{144941}Maybe?
{144948}{144967}I don't know.
{144974}{144995}You don't know?
{145058}{145141}You were at the horse show|that day.
{145174}{145263}You never rode again after that.|I think maybe you blame yourself.
{145296}{145343}God, it's on the tip of my brain.
{145452}{145483}He died right here.
{145554}{145610}He... died right here.
{145616}{145687}Did he see you coming, Jerry?|Did he beg for his life?
{145694}{145767}You put a gun to his head|and you shot him!
{145774}{145871}He died in the dirt, like an animal!|You killed my father!
{145878}{145979}Answer me! I have to know!|Tell me, please.
{145986}{146024}Please tell me!
{146218}{146291}I went to the court|to kill your father.
{146318}{146343}I'm sorry.
{146350}{146426}I was programmed to do that.|The Ezekiel Walters hearing.
{146433}{146483}I had a gun...
{146490}{146591}...and I couldn't shoot him.|I couldn't do it because I saw you.
{146612}{146654}That was the first time I saw you.
{146661}{146705}That was the first time we met.
{146748}{146814}And, I knew that if I was to screw up...
{146821}{146895}...Jonas would send|someone else to do the job.
{146902}{146987}So I decided to watch him|and make him safe, make it safe.
{147002}{147032}He had to carry a gun.
{147042}{147063}I know.
{147070}{147165}He stuck it in my face the|first time I tried to introduce myself.
{147172}{147203}I had to...
{147320}{147355}I didn't kill him.
{147504}{147579}I didn't kill him.|We became friends.
{147651}{147686}He made good coffee.
{147732}{147791}He helped me remember|all of this stuff.
{147896}{147957}One of Jonas' guys... no!
{148216}{148294}When I got here,|he was already dying.
{148346}{148389}He was dying when I got here.
{148396}{148477}What does Jonas have to do|with Ezekiel Walters?
{148610}{148673}Ezekiel Carl Walters...
{148776}{148826}Ezekiel Walters is a Jonas fall guy!
{148833}{148921}He's the three name thing!|Ezekiel Carl Walters!
{148980}{149047}He was innocent,|innocent of everything.
{149098}{149193}Your father was going to reopen|the case because...
{149212}{149253}...he didn't accept the official story.
{149260}{149283}Why?
{149354}{149393}Because he believed me.
{149402}{149443}He believed me.
{149566}{149663}He believed that I couldn't do|what I was meant to do to him...
{149670}{149727}...and he was going to|blow it wide-open...
{149734}{149795}...before Jonas sent someone else.|He was going to...
{149954}{149987}When he was dying...
{150010}{150063}...he was still really worried|about you.
{150114}{150175}He took your picture out of his wallet.
{150186}{150223}He called you his baby.
{150266}{150329}I told him I'd keep you safe.
{150368}{150435}And I kept your picture,|and I've been watching you ever since.
{150502}{150533}I didn't kill him.
{150568}{150619}But I was late and...
{150662}{150693}I'm sorry.
{150744}{150771}I'm sorry.
{151016}{151049}I believe you.
{151068}{151101}I believe you.
{151423}{151455}He made great coffee.
{151525}{151557}They traced my phone. Sorry.
{151564}{151586}Oh, my God!
{151598}{151644}I have to ask you one thing.
{151651}{151673}You switched the charts?
{151680}{151710}Now is not the time.
{151717}{151767}Now is all I got!|Did you switch them?
{151810}{151827}Yes.
{151836}{151869}I knew it.
{152025}{152038}Freeze!
{152131}{152193}- Freeze!|- Get away from her!
{152332}{152379}- Get off me!|- Leave her alone!
{152416}{152459}Get off me!
{152498}{152539}Let go of me!
{152562}{152594}Get off her!
{152935}{152977}You embarrassed me, Jerry.
{152984}{153063}You made certain people|take notice of me who shouldn't have.
{153184}{153221}You all right?
{154178}{154215}You shouldn't watch, Jerry.
{154246}{154297}It's a moment without hope.
{154338}{154385}You've never seen her run.
{155620}{155689}This will put my words in your mouth.
{155882}{155985}Once this does its job, you'll swear|that you killed her yourself.
{156032}{156071}She's dead, you know.
{156196}{156265}Well, then you can't hurt me anymore.
{156310}{156355}I'll be the judge of that.
{156598}{156645}Come on in.|I'll get the lights.
{156864}{156901}Holy shit!
{156910}{156938}We need to talk.
{156945}{157011}When I was in here last night,|there were desks.
{157018}{157113}I'm going to call the management|right now. This is not good.
{157125}{157197}You guys, I'll meet you downstairs.|Go ahead.
{157252}{157277}Come on.
{157362}{157421}Who's the Deputy Director of the FBI?
{157430}{157483}You think we have time for 20 Questions?
{157496}{157555}Hold it right there.|Put your hands in the air.
{157722}{157750}What gave me away?
{157775}{157833}Nothing.|I just wanted to make sure.
{157851}{157885}Who are you guys?
{157924}{157983}If the intelligence world|was a family...
{157996}{158054}...think of us as the uncle|no one talks about.
{158140}{158173}We watch Jerry.
{158188}{158235}Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
{158256}{158323}Jonas has shown himself.|Why don't you take him?
{158344}{158387}Jonas builds assassins.
{158396}{158478}We need to know who and where|they are and who Jonas works for.
{158540}{158595}Jonas had my father killed, didn't he?
{158666}{158692}We think so.
{158742}{158791}- Do you know where Jerry is?|- No.
{158798}{158851}I wish I did. Honest.
{158928}{158963}What are you going to do?
{158992}{159027}I'm going to find him...
{159046}{159091}...because he'd find me.
{159116}{159203}- Let's work together on this.|- I don't think that's a good idea.
{159252}{159331}At least take a number|where you can call if you need me.
{159338}{159379}Hands in the air.
{159666}{159695}I'm sorry.
{160015}{160047}Everybody's sorry.
{163348}{163379}Geronimo.
{163394}{163415}Son of a bitch!
{164024}{164106}The President had left the area|only moments earlier and is now...
{164113}{164139}...safe in Germany.
{164146}{164234}The quake in southern Turkey|measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.
{164241}{164324}Thousands are feared missing or dead.|More on this story as it...
{164524}{164548}Can I help you?
{164555}{164594}I'm with the Justice Department.
{164601}{164662}I need to see any male patients|brought in...
{164669}{164700}...in the last 12 hours.
{164707}{164791}Justice Department?|You got credentials or something?
{165076}{165099}Treasury Department.
{165165}{165229}But it'll do.|Come on, let's go.
{165308}{165379}You're just too good to be true
{165388}{165421}That's better.
{165616}{165647}Yo, Marie!
{165654}{165686}Those two guys in today?
{165698}{165755}Transferred to|Mount Vernon immediately.
{165796}{165823}Sorry.
{166272}{166311}Jerry, can you hear me?
{166454}{166489}Can you hear me, Jerry?
{166696}{166767}You're just too good to be true
{166796}{166841}Jerry, tell me where you are!
{166982}{167031}I love you, baby
{167084}{167139}And if it's quite all right
{167148}{167190}I need you, baby
{167197}{167261}Through all the lonely nights
{167272}{167293}Hi, Alice.
{167332}{167365}Hi, Jerry.
{167372}{167422}Alice, I'm sorry you're dead.
{167464}{167519}Jerry, tell me where you are.
{167533}{167559}Right here.
{167688}{167722}Where's "here," Jerry?
{167751}{167785}On the floor.
{167864}{167919}Behind a waffle or a...
{167998}{168075}The paint is peeling on the ceiling.
{168112}{168159}That rhymes.|Peeling on the ceiling.
{168238}{168285}Nice views, and I can...
{168436}{168497}I can see the smokestacks in the light.
{168504}{168543}Good views.
{168552}{168609}Where can you see|the smokestacks from?
{168666}{168717}That would be the power station.
{168724}{168813}You can see it from the north wing,|but that's been closed for two years.
{168820}{168845}Take me there, right now.
{168852}{168890}I'm coming to get you.
{169040}{169075}You can fit through there?
{169092}{169125}Around this corner.
{169136}{169163}Down the hall.
{169194}{169250}Just honk the horn.|I'll come out.
{169288}{169313}This is it.
{169320}{169367}- You have a key?|- I don't have a key.
{169396}{169421}Can you break it open?
{169428}{169474}$100 doesn't cover this.
{169484}{169541}I'll clean the place up.
{169564}{169591}No, wait!
{169598}{169643}Let's think about this!
{170128}{170177}This is as far as I go, lady.
{170200}{170283}Call the police and this man.|Tell them where I am.
{170308}{170343}I'll call for backup.
{170356}{170387}I'll call for backup.
{170394}{170490}Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name
{171554}{171591}What'd you think this would do?
{171639}{171699}How would I know?|I'm tied up on the floor.
{171793}{171862}I don't know,|maybe I wanted some attention.
{171877}{171916}I was lonely.
{172323}{172363}Are you all right?
{172417}{172490}This is, like,|the best dream I ever had.
{172620}{172662}Could you untie me?

{173399}{173432}Oh, God! I'm sorry.
{173439}{173460}Can you walk?
{173467}{173496}I think so.
{173555}{173580}Kiss me.
{173607}{173634}For luck.
{173651}{173675}Kiss me and...

{173745}{173796}I'm certifiable, I know...
{173803}{173874}...but kiss me once.|Kiss me, then we'll go.
{174477}{174535}Jerry, you continually surprise me.
{175055}{175075}Go!
{175224}{175305}I always seem to come between you|and the men in your life.

{177235}{177270}Is that this place?

{177389}{177422}It's love.
{177455}{177504}Love gives you wings.
{177555}{177627}And helps you fly|and we can fly away.

{184001}{184034}Geronimo.
{184460}{184539}As long as they think you're dead,|she's safe.
{184588}{184631}I kept my end of the bargain.
{184644}{184677}What about yours?
{184684}{184726}I'll tell you all I remember.
{184733}{184831}I'll give you all the gravy on Jonas|and his operation and...
