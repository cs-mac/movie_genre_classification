1
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:13,311
<i>I'm in love with your brother</i>

2
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:14,783
<i>Yes, I am</i>

3
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:18,495
<i>But maybe I shouldn't
ask for his name</i>

4
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,127
<i>And you danced</i>

5
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:22,047
<i>Oh, what a dance</i>

6
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,647
<i>And you laughed</i>

7
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,119
<i>Oh, what a laugh...</i>

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,587
What the fuck are you doing?

9
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,135
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

10
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:43,167
Alicia, this is Brink.
Hi. Alicia, you made it.

11
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:44,927
Mmm. You smell like
American shampoo.

12
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:46,528
What? It's different
outside of the U.S.?

13
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,359
"Is it different?" you said.

14
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,032
This is Agustin's sister, Barbara.

15
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,560
This is Alicia. My baby
cousin from California.

16
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,974
Hi.

17
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,791
How was your trip?

18
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:04,383
It was good. It was long.

19
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,071
Is this your first
time in South America?

20
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:09,312
Um, it's my first time
outside of the U.S.

21
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,399
Oh.

22
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,519
You're kidding me?

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,927
Guys, we need to go. It's late.

24
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,199
No. She's been on a plane for hours.
She needs to take a shower.

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,351
Really?

26
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,431
This radio only plays CDs.
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,006
Don't worry about it. Come on.

28
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,831
Do we really have to
rush to the South?

29
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,359
Yeah. Trust me, you don't want
to stay in Santiago for long.

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,151
It's fucking boring.

31
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,007
Oh, is the South gonna be better?

32
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,791
How long does it take to get there?

33
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:41,023
Like 12 hours. You can get
a good sleep in the car.

34
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,783
Yeah. That's true.

35
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,895
Hey, I'm sorry my mom was so pushy

36
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,175
about me coming here.

37
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,064
I guess I just needed a break.

38
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:50,911
Oh, shut up. Don't be silly.
I'm so glad you're here.

39
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,768
Well, thank you.

40
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,095
So, what's with you and Agustin?
It's serious, right?

41
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,751
Uh, yeah. It's good.
We'll see what happens.

42
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,607
And who is that Brink guy?

43
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,135
He and Agustin met at
their gringo high school.

44
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,248
His dad is a diplomat or something.

45
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,520
Agustin brought him here
especially for you.

46
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,543
Yeah, he seems fun.

47
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,823
Sara?

48
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,360
I'll just be out here.
Don't be too long, okay?

49
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:12,774
Okay.

50
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,998
Okay. I'll just...
I'll keep calling her.

51
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,255
Alicia! We're gonna be
waiting in the car.

52
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,399
Agustin knows this guy.
Pedropiedra.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,191
He is so fucking weird. Right?

54
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:41,856
English.

55
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,199
Speak English, please.

56
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,175
He pissed on the audience.
So gross.

57
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,159
How long have you been in Chile?

58
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,231
Longer than I expected.
Like two and a half years.

59
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:53,151
Yeah. We're gonna get
Sara to stay longer, too.

60
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,351
No. She has one
semester and that's it.

61
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,791
Yeah. I don't know. We'll see.

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,430
Can you turn the
music down a second?

63
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,142
<i>Hola.</i>

64
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:10,943
Uh...

65
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,311
One second. It's Paloma.

66
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,367
Uh...

67
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,383
Okay. Um...

68
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,823
Barbara, can you please pull over?

69
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:18,944
Sara, what's going on?

70
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,806
It's okay. It's just school.

71
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,703
Fucking great timing.

72
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,175
What are we gonna tell them?

73
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,542
Can you tell her to tell
him that I'm on my way?

74
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,935
Guys, don't kill me.

75
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:58,047
I have to go back to Santiago.
I'm so sorry.

76
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,359
What? Yeah.

77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,607
Today? Right now?

78
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,391
It's just gonna be you,
me, and Barbara, and her?

79
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:04,927
No. I'm going with her.

80
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,783
We're gonna get a bus
in Tijuana or something.

81
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,120
I'm not gonna take
care of your friends.

82
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,335
Barbara, it's fine.
I'll go by myself.

83
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,775
Don't worry about it,
Agustin. I'll be fine.

84
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:14,367
No, no, no, no. Are you crazy?
I'm coming with you.

85
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,319
No, no, you can't.
I'm just going for school.

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,983
I'll be back tomorrow. It's fine.

87
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,903
Sara, of course, I'm coming with you.
Are you kidding me?

88
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:22,047
I just got here.
I wanna be with you.

89
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,351
That's why I came out here.
Let's go!

90
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,055
Okay. We'll see, all right?
Let's go.

91
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,823
But you don't really have to go.

92
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,071
I just don't believe you.

93
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:52,543
It's an exam. Who cares?

94
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,687
Well, I care. I mean,
I've already failed one exam.

95
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:57,119
And I have to graduate at
some point. It's important.

96
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,431
Yeah, but you never cared before.

97
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,543
We're in Southern Chile.
What are you doing?

98
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:02,047
I'm gonna be gone
for, like, one day.

99
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,487
And they're really sweet.
Have fun with them.

100
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:06,143
Yeah, but, Sara, like, what's
the difference, you know?

101
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,575
If I come with you, then we
could just come back together.

102
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,751
You'll have so much more
fun if you stay here.

103
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,926
And you've been traveling for so long.
Just get there already.

104
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,094
No. I don't want to let
you go by yourself.

105
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,750
I'll be fine.

106
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:25,599
Agustin, what's going on?
This is stressing me out.

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,031
You're lucky. The next bus
is leaving very soon.

108
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,151
Yeah. I'm really lucky.

109
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,831
Hey, Agustin. Can you talk to her?
I don't think she should go on her own.

110
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,135
Okay, Alicia, enough.
Be nice to her, okay?

111
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:36,639
We'll be nice to her.

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,078
Agustin, we're gonna be so late.
What's keeping us?

113
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:51,999
Barbara, would you mind if we slowed
down just a little bit, please?

114
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,918
No, Melda's waiting for us.

115
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:02,463
Can we change this shit?
Come on. You pick one.

116
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,799
I don't really know
that much about music.

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,015
Be adventurous.

118
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,903
Just whatever you find.
Don't worry.

119
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,759
Agustin, stop reading this
stupid hypnosis book.

120
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,975
Here.

121
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,447
What does it say, anyway?

122
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,079
Put me in a trance.

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,295
Put me to sleep.

124
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,647
Shut up.

125
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,614
Come on, hypnotize me or something.

126
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:24,198
Seriously?

127
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:25,894
I like it.

128
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:29,543
This shit gives me the creeps.
Sorry.

129
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,703
What the fuck?

130
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,935
Just leave it. Great pick, Alicia.

131
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:36,991
I'm really sorry.

132
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,399
I'm kidding.

133
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,415
Don't worry.
This happened before.

134
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,399
It hasn't happened to me.

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,615
Well, not in a while.

136
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,759
Alicia, don't worry.
It happens all the time.

137
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,335
<i>Folks, here's the story
'bout Minnie the Moocher</i>

138
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:55,423
<i>She was a red-hot
hootchie-cootcher</i>

139
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:59,359
<i>She was the roughest,
toughest frail</i>

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,679
<i>But Minnie had a heart
as big as a whale</i>

141
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,239
<i>Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi</i>

142
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,583
<i>Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi...</i>

143
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,879
<i>She messed around with
a bloke named Smoky.</i>

144
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,319
Agustin, go look for Melda.

145
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,927
Go ask the guy over there.

146
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:35,391
I'm coming with you, Agustin.
I wanna meet a Mapuche.

147
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,903
These people must be
pretty exotic for you.

148
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,879
Yeah. It's really rustic.

149
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,951
It's not like they're
wearing feathers, you know.

150
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,719
Why are these sheep here?

151
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,127
Baby, sorry.

152
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,599
Yeah. She's all right, I guess.

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,013
What's it called again?

154
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,638
Mapuches.

155
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,983
Mapuches.

156
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:05,733
White people in this country
have totally fucked them up.

157
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,103
You already paid for them?

158
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,279
Are you freaking out?

159
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,295
Is it gonna be enough?

160
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:38,303
Okay. I have to go. I'll call
you again later. Okay. Bye.

161
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,111
I need to pee. Cover.

162
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:51,295
What?

163
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:53,702
I need to pee. Can you keep cover?

164
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,398
Oh, my God.

165
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,118
What the fuck is that?

166
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,751
What? What happened?

167
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,831
Come and look.

168
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,103
Ew! It's two puppies.

169
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:10,374
God. That one's sick. Look, he's
got, like, warts all over his body.

170
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,031
We should rescue them.

171
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,551
It's got blisters. Look.

172
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,023
We have to save the sick one.

173
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,391
No. Barbara, if we're gonna take
one, let's take the good one.

174
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,119
You're such a bitch.
Take the sick one.

175
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,262
No. Just leave it there.
Come on, guys, seriously.

176
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,647
Aw... Poor things.

177
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,431
Ugh!

178
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:47,014
Hell, no, enough of this shit.

179
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:50,791
This is so fucking stupid!

180
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,455
Okay. You leave that stupid dog.

181
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:56,959
Barbara, chill out.

182
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,399
No. I'm not gonna chill out.

183
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,351
You want to leave the dog?
Leave the stupid dog.

184
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,399
You started this!
I'm not doing shit!

185
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:10,181
What are you guys doing?

186
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,383
So dramatic.

187
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,294
<i>Folks, here's the story
'bout Minnie the Moocher</i>

188
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:22,591
<i>She was a red-hot
hootchie-cootcher</i>

189
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:26,527
<i>She was the roughest,
toughest frail</i>

190
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:31,078
<i>But Minnie had a heart
as big as a whale...</i>

191
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:52,543
Hi. Thank you.

192
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,126
Thank you.

193
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,103
Shit!

194
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,599
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

195
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,230
Oh, my God!

196
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,773
Is everything okay? Just...

197
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,125
Shit.

198
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,750
Alicia, don't worry.

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,087
Shut the fuck up.

200
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,318
Close the door behind you, please.

201
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,301
Alicia.

202
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:36,997
This is your room.

203
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:38,751
Okay.

204
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:41,599
Hey, I'm really sorry about
your bag. I really am.

205
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,077
Sure. It's okay.

206
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,790
Thank you.

207
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,223
English.

208
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,797
Oh, sorry, Alicia.

209
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,838
What a gentleman.

210
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,822
Brink? Mmm-hmm.

211
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,030
From 1 to 10,
how much do you like him?

212
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,445
I don't know.

213
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:39,966
We just met.

214
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,214
From 1 to 10, how
much do you like her?

215
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,950
6.4, 6.5.

216
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,550
No, I'm kidding.

217
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:50,174
10, 11. The most.

218
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,485
No. I can take a 6. It's okay.

219
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:55,333
Thank you.

220
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,462
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

221
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,863
Yeah. Um... Not in Chile.

222
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,925
We broke up, 'cause...

223
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
Has anyone talked to Sara?

224
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,327
I tried to call her today, but...

225
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,862
I talked to her.

226
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:19,902
She sat next to that screaming
baby the entire way.

227
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,375
Fuck that baby.

228
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,677
Well, she's coming tomorrow, right?
So, it's not that bad.

229
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,550
Yeah. True.

230
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,054
True.

231
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:36,158
Agustin.

232
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:39,454
Yeah, it should.

233
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,101
Uh... I think. Maybe there.

234
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,935
Hey.

235
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,829
Take a look at this video.

236
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:06,111
That video doesn't do
anything, Agustin.

237
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:07,582
Whatever. You should
try it, though.

238
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,853
Relax your eyes,
and stare at the center.

239
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,270
He's good.

240
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,159
He once cured this stomach
ache I had for 2 days.

241
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,102
That's disgusting, Barbara.
What's wrong with your body?

242
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:20,286
What's wrong with your face?

243
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:24,926
It's never worked for me,

244
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,975
so don't feel bad
if it doesn't work.

245
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,318
Can I look away now?

246
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,846
Agustin, stop it.
She's not liking it.

247
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,837
Why don't you finish
what you start, Alicia?

248
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:36,958
Okay, now...

249
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,374
Hey!

250
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:39,973
This.

251
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,431
Whoa. That's trippy.

252
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:43,903
Right? Mmm-hmm.

253
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,527
You want me to hypnotize
you for real now?

254
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:47,646
Okay.

255
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:51,262
I have to study, so keep it quiet.

256
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,805
Mmm-hmm.

257
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,399
Okay. Lay here.

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,542
No. I'm tired.

259
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,014
Oh. Maybe tomorrow.

260
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,310
Come on. Try new things. It's fun.

261
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,262
But I didn't really
sleep on the plane.

262
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,727
Yeah. That's cool. Good night.

263
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,230
Thank you. Good night, guys.

264
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,318
Sleep well. Good night.

265
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,893
Yeah, you, too.

266
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:15,301
Hey, let's watch a
movie or something?

267
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,159
Hey, fucker! Answer me.

268
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,495
I'm trying to do something here.

269
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:27,583
Hey, what's the weirdest place

270
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:29,829
you've ever had sex with Sara?

271
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,981
Or are you the conservative types?

272
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,870
It's so cold.

273
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:47,109
I wish Alicia was
here to keep me warm.

274
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,478
It's ready.

275
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,526
Go tell Alicia to come down.

276
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:05,503
Alicia! Alicia!

277
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,821
Breakfast, amiga.

278
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,542
Alicia.

279
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:17,790
That's disgusting.

280
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,966
Ew!

281
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,982
What were you dreaming about?

282
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,070
You don't wanna know.

283
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:24,742
Yes, I do.

284
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,237
What's so funny?

285
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,645
Hey, Alicia, how did you sleep?

286
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,878
I slept great. Thank you.

287
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,805
You look tired.

288
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:44,038
I love the South.
I always sleep like a pig.

289
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,830
Have you heard from Sara?

290
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,854
Not yet.

291
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,894
There's no reception here.

292
00:22:56,895 --> 00:23:00,133
If you want me, I can
call Bernardo and ask.

293
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:03,685
Pass the coffee.

294
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:08,094
Bernardo?

295
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,662
Bernardo, can you hear me?

296
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,158
Bernardo. Copy, copy.
This is Barbara.

297
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:15,646
Look, he's not there.

298
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:19,071
He'll call me once she
gets here. Don't worry.

299
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,645
I'm not worried.

300
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:38,942
Alicia, there's no reception here.

301
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,990
No. I was just trying
to check my voicemail.

302
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:43,038
Well, we're going to the Fat Hill.

303
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,901
You can call from there.
You wanna come?

304
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,878
Do you think it's gonna rain?

305
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,222
Yeah, you never really know.

306
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:50,373
But we have raincoats here.

307
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:51,870
Go grab one.

308
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:53,413
Okay.

309
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,517
Hurry up.

310
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,598
Do you need a license to go
hunting here or something?

311
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,358
Is it legal?

312
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,773
What?

313
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,021
Yeah. Your turn is over.

314
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,589
Brink, wait.

315
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,733
Brink?

316
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:48,326
Hey?

317
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,533
Brink, please don't shoot.

318
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:05,829
Holy shit.

319
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:14,821
Is it dead?

320
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:21,989
I feel really stupid now.
You're upset.

321
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:26,046
I don't really care.

322
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:27,877
You can do whatever you want.

323
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,525
You guys wanna play tennis?

324
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:38,398
Yeah, sure. I could play tennis.

325
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:40,350
I'm not good, though.

326
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:41,694
Yeah, there are some roller skates.

327
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:43,454
You can do that and
skate like a faggot.

328
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,214
Hey, shut your mouth.
You're the faggot.

329
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:47,230
Whose tennis courts
are these, anyway?

330
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:50,245
It's everybody's.
We share them.

331
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:08,228
Wanna play roller tennis?

332
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,244
No.

333
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:12,709
I'm gonna go call Sara.

334
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,101
We said we were sorry.

335
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,677
<i>Hey, baby, what's up?</i>

336
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:11,038
Where are you?

337
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,894
<i>Uh... I'm on my way to school.</i>

338
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,518
<i>I tried to call you this morning,
but there was no reception.</i>

339
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,694
<i>Hey, I have to stay until tomorrow.</i>

340
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,070
Tomorrow?

341
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,901
<i>Yeah, I arrive in the morning.</i>

342
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:23,806
Why didn't you tell me?

343
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:27,070
<i>Well, I'm telling you right now.</i>
<i>I'm kind of trapped up here.</i>

344
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:29,374
No. I'm trapped here.

345
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,398
<i>What?</i>

346
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,350
I just want to get
out of this place.

347
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,134
<i>What? Alicia, what?</i>
<i>I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

348
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,830
These people are sadists, Sara.

349
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:40,101
<i>What? Alicia, those
people are my friend.</i>

350
00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:44,165
<i>Hello?</i>

351
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:49,438
<i>Baby, I can't hear you.
Hey, can you...</i>

352
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:51,646
<i>Can you tell Agustin that
everything is going well,</i>

353
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,084
<i>and can you ask him to call...</i>
What?

354
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:57,598
Hello? <i>Hello?</i>

355
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,750
<i>Can you hear me?
I can hear you perfectly.</i>

356
00:27:58,751 --> 00:27:59,774
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

357
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:01,189
Hello?

358
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:03,358
<i>Hello? Alicia, can you hear me?</i>

359
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,268
I can't hear you, Sara.
Just call me back later, okay.

360
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,589
Hey, did you talk to her?

361
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,054
Who?

362
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:10,302
Sara, who else?

363
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:11,486
Who else what?

364
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,806
Did you talk to her?
What did she say?

365
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,462
Yeah, she'll be here
tomorrow morning.

366
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:20,189
What's with all the questions, man?

367
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,165
Come on, I dare you.

368
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,254
No, too close.

369
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,149
Hey, hey.

370
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,646
Hey, friend, hey.
Come here, come here.

371
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,750
What are you doing out here?
You should be working.

372
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:53,285
No? Lazy dog.

373
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,020
Ugh...

374
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,477
Stop it. Get off of me.

375
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,589
Get off me!

376
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,325
Oh, my God. No, no.

377
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:08,830
Sorry about that.

378
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,660
Oh, my God. So funny.

379
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:18,366
I'm done. I'm gonna call Sara.

380
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,612
Sara, Sara, always Sara.

381
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:40,997
Hi.

382
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,238
Oh...

383
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:33,189
This room is toasty,
toasty, toasty.

384
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,485
I'm not making lunch.

385
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,183
There's a lot of
things in the kitchen.

386
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,556
Take whatever you want.

387
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,518
Hey, sorry about that dog.

388
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,558
It's getting old and crazy.

389
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,061
Yeah, he thought you were a bitch,

390
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:06,182
but we told him you were
actually really nice.

391
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,773
Thank you.

392
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:19,357
Who am I kidding?
I'm, like, not even reading.

393
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:21,181
Sitting here just going...

394
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:22,948
Whoo.

395
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,701
You want a drink?

396
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,582
Sure.

397
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,701
Take mine.

398
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:30,149
Oh.

399
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:42,461
Wow, yum. What is that?

400
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,732
It's pisco with Coke.
Chilean people love drinking it.

401
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:47,748
I'm having one, too.

402
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,838
Hey, we're gonna visit
my cousins tonight.

403
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,661
And you are coming with us.

404
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:55,076
Sure.

405
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:56,932
Good.

406
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,877
I really like this.
It tastes like candy.

407
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:06,500
And you love candy?

408
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:18,365
Oh, Alicia, your
friend is calling me.

409
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:19,972
Shut up, Brink.

410
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,198
That's the house?

411
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,822
"That's the house?"
Why? Are you scared?

412
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:28,325
I don't talk like
that, you shit-fuck.

413
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:34,078
Agustin, what about
this one up above?

414
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,742
Yeah, let's try it. You go.

415
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:37,764
Yeah. Push me?

416
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:40,349
Okay, you have me?

417
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,829
Yeah.

418
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:44,957
It's open, yes.

419
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,428
Okay, okay, higher, higher.

420
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:49,157
Oh, yeah.

421
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:55,205
Hey, Brink, open this door.

422
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,845
Welcome to my horny abode.

423
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:01,094
Good job, man. Fuck yeah.

424
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:04,382
Alicia, give me whiskey?

425
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:06,213
Mmm, Alicia germs.

426
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:08,765
Look at this room.

427
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,077
Mmm.

428
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:12,070
Look at that thing.

429
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,716
Agustin wants the bottle.
Come get it.

430
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,812
Hey... Let's go to
my uncle's house.

431
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:31,974
Agustin, look.

432
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,054
No!

433
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:47,326
Brink, get off me.

434
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:49,054
Get off me, man.
What are you doing?

435
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:51,230
Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa!

436
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,382
Man, what the fuck?

437
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,660
Relax, <i>callate, I'm being the dog.</i>

438
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:02,398
I'm that dog. I'm that dog.
No, no, no, no.

439
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,965
Hey! Let's go see the
tennis court upstairs!

440
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:08,254
I'm that dog. I'm that dog.
I'm that dog. I'm that dog.

441
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,278
Stop it. Stop it!

442
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:14,084
Brink!

443
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:16,101
No!

444
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,228
Fucking shit.

445
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:22,813
Motherfucker! I'm bleeding.

446
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:23,966
Hey! What happened?

447
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,846
She kicked me in the face.
You stupid idiot!

448
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:29,092
You think you're so funny.

449
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,134
Well, you're not funny.

450
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:33,789
Oh, you're such a delight, Alicia.

451
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,605
You call me a bitch and then
you're touching me and...

452
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:38,493
Are you bleeding for real?

453
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:41,437
I don't even know you.
I don't know either of you.

454
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,141
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

455
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,165
Yeah, why don't you go lie down?

456
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,772
Oh, my God.

457
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,109
She obviously had
too much to drink.

458
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,334
She was wasted.

459
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,069
But that was the mood, that
was the mood of the night.

460
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,605
And she's the one who got violent.

461
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,237
You were fucking acting weird.

462
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:30,021
But I wasn't violent.
I wasn't violent, ever.

463
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:44,254
Come on, pick up the phone.

464
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:45,566
Pick up the phone, Sara.

465
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,869
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone. Pick up.

466
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,406
Pick up the phone.

467
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,293
Sara, please pick up the phone.

468
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,150
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

469
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,173
<i>Alicia.</i>

470
00:36:54,174 --> 00:36:57,149
Sara, finally!

471
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,006
Are you on your way here?

472
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:00,445
Have you taken that exam already?

473
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:03,076
<i>Alicia, you know I'm not
here because of school.</i>

474
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:04,925
<i>What's going on, baby?</i>

475
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:06,813
What? Where are you?

476
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:10,045
Sara, you have no idea
what has been going on.

477
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:13,373
This dog tried to hump me and
then I made Brink bleed.

478
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:14,589
<i>Shit.</i>

479
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,638
And it wasn't my fault,
I didn't mean to do it.

480
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,453
He fucking made me.
They killed a bird.

481
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:22,365
Brink killed the bird and
he just didn't care.

482
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,741
It was like...

483
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,957
Shh... Wait.

484
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,653
<i>What is it? Oh, my God.</i>

485
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,861
It's fucking Barbara.

486
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:32,797
She doesn't, like, let me make any
noise here. I can't even breathe.

487
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,268
She's fucking crazy.

488
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,565
I think she's just mad

489
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:40,004
because I dropped her
bag in the water.

490
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,093
It's not like I was
trying to fist fuck her.

491
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:50,909
Believe me, she would
know if I was.

492
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,100
No, no.

493
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,932
Alicia?

494
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:15,908
Alicia.

495
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,348
Alicia.

496
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:32,413
What are you doing?

497
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,404
I'm making some toast.

498
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:37,918
Huh.

499
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:40,477
Your cousin's here.
She's crossing the lake.

500
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,725
Okay.

501
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,773
I'm really sorry about all
the noise I made last night.

502
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:44,797
What?

503
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:47,300
It won't happen again, okay?

504
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:56,573
Hi, guys.

505
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,564
Hey, are you coming with us?

506
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,693
Yeah, you're going down? Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I'll come.

507
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,005
Are you still bleeding?

508
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,125
Kind of.

509
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:05,405
No, he's not.

510
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,812
Yes, I was, Agustin.
You didn't see.

511
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,830
Um... Do you want some
snacks or something?

512
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:14,461
Yeah, bring some.

513
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:16,804
I'll bring some. We'll
be down by the pier.

514
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,989
Hi. Hi.

515
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,941
This weather's so shitty. I know.

516
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,621
Can you help me? Yeah.

517
00:40:46,622 --> 00:40:47,677
Are you all right?

518
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,092
Yeah, I'm fine.

519
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,878
Hey, I missed you.

520
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,381
I'm sorry, that took so
much longer than I thought.

521
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:55,972
Are you fluent in Spanish by now?
No.

522
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,461
Come on. Hey, where's this house?

523
00:40:58,462 --> 00:40:59,709
Right there.

524
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,989
Sara.

525
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,933
What? No, nothing. Nothing.

526
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,789
I'm just really happy to have
somebody to speak English with.

527
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,877
Hey, let's go to those rocks.

528
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,053
What? You didn't speak
English with her?

529
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:10,269
Brink, are you serious?

530
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,677
I do speak English.

531
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,973
Chill out. I'm just used
to speaking Spanish.

532
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,477
You're not really though, are you?

533
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:17,885
'Cause you kind of sound
retarded when you do.

534
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:20,164
Here, take a photo of us.

535
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:21,679
Sure.

536
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,539
I guess I don't really
need to be in it, do I?

537
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:27,043
Come on.

538
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,461
Got it?

539
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:31,901
I'm freezing. Can we go inside?

540
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:33,757
Okay, let's go in.
Tell me, how do you feel?

541
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,933
Alicia, you're not even smiling.
Do one where you smile.

542
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,981
What the fuck is wrong with them?
Did you tell her?

543
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:39,485
No, are you insane?

544
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:41,917
They had such a big
fight last night.

545
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,197
They had a fight? What happened?

546
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:44,605
Don't worry. So, how was it?

547
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:46,077
It's fine. I'm fine.

548
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:47,517
Did it hurt a lot?
I don't want to talk about it.

549
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:48,733
What do you mean?
You have to talk about it.

550
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:50,141
It was my baby, too.

551
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:52,861
Shut up, it was not a baby.
Don't say that.

552
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:55,140
Hey, Agustin, can
I have my food, please?

553
00:41:57,757 --> 00:41:59,389
What's up, bitch?

554
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,637
What's up, puppy killer?

555
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,813
I knew you were traumatized.

556
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,445
You're such a gringa.

557
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:06,205
No, I didn't tell anyone.

558
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,061
No, chill, Agustin told me.

559
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:09,661
I can't believe you just left
it on the side of the road.

560
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:10,909
That's really fucked up.

561
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,180
Oh, get over it. Did you get
your shit straightened out?

562
00:42:14,653 --> 00:42:16,829
Yeah, I did my exam,

563
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,461
but I probably failed
it or something.

564
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:19,613
So I kinda don't
wanna talk about it.

565
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:20,989
Agustin. Mmm-hmm.

566
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:27,805
Yeah.

567
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,381
Hey, go get your swimsuits.
We're going to the rock.

568
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,301
These people are fucking crazy.

569
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,053
I'm so sorry I hung
up on you last night.

570
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,357
Barbara has been making
my life impossible.

571
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:40,573
Why? What's she doing?

572
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,909
She won't let me move in my room.

573
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,372
So, what did you do in Santiago?

574
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:48,541
What? I told you. I had
to retake an exam.

575
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,869
No, that's not what you said
on the phone last night.

576
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,301
We didn't talk on the
phone last night.

577
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:56,900
Yes, we did, when
I told you about Brink.

578
00:42:57,565 --> 00:42:58,589
We didn't talk about that.

579
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,437
Agustin just told me about the stupid
fight you guys had last night.

580
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:02,852
What?

581
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,445
Yes, we did.

582
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:06,340
No, we didn't.

583
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,124
No?

584
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,524
I mean...

585
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:14,052
On the hill.

586
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:18,755
Alicia?

587
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:22,460
I really don't think that
this room is that bad.

588
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:25,597
It's kind of depressing and ugly,

589
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:29,597
and there's probably like cum stains
all over the mattress. Ew.

590
00:43:29,598 --> 00:43:32,029
But, I don't know, it's not
scary or anything. It's fine.

591
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,269
Yeah, well, thanks
for staying with me,

592
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,381
because you could have
stayed with Agustin, right?

593
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:38,397
No, are you crazy?
Of course I'm gonna stay with you.

594
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,157
I want to keep you company.

595
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:42,820
We're gonna have fun, okay?
I promise.

596
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:47,965
You okay?

597
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:48,988
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

598
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,300
You just had a nightmare

599
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,701
and you need to brush it off.
You'll be fine.

600
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:53,981
Sara, let's go. We're ready.

601
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:55,452
Okay, we're coming.

602
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:57,533
Ooh! It's freezing!

603
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,252
Are you gonna be okay
in that tiny wetsuit?

604
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:01,373
Do you want my sweater?

605
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:02,621
Oh, no. Thank you.

606
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:05,085
I'm okay. You sure?
It's really warm.

607
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:08,669
Alicia, he's being so nice to you.
Gold star, Brink.

608
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,460
Yeah, I like that
he's being nice now.

609
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:12,221
I'm always nice.

610
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:13,635
You want this towel?

611
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:16,036
Sure.

612
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:41,379
Here, you can take my hand.

613
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:46,973
Sara, I'm jumping after you.

614
00:44:46,974 --> 00:44:48,445
No, no, no. Sara,
you're not jumping.

615
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:50,141
We all are. What, why?

616
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:53,021
I'm gonna sit here and take photos.
I don't feel great.

617
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:54,364
Sara... But you
should totally jump.

618
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:55,812
Alicia, we're jumping.

619
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,732
Yeah!

620
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,491
It looks cool doing it.

621
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,077
Jump in. Come on, ladies first.

622
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:11,133
After you.

623
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:12,221
Go, Alicia.

624
00:45:12,222 --> 00:45:14,404
Sara, he's going first.

625
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:19,875
I'm so scared.

626
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:23,676
Go, bitch.

627
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:25,316
Don't call me that.

628
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,771
Okay, sayonara.

629
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,805
Oh, my God!

630
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:41,341
Is the bottom far down?

631
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,517
No, you can't even
see the bottom, go.

632
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,789
Okay, well, what if
I hit the rocks there?

633
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,845
Go!

634
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:48,509
You're fine.

635
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,429
Brink, move.

636
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,149
Just move, Brink, please.

637
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,589
Brink, just fucking move.

638
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,645
Jump!

639
00:45:55,646 --> 00:45:57,540
Yeah. Go, Alicia!

640
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:00,388
We're going to count, okay?

641
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:02,205
1...

642
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:03,421
2...

643
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:06,876
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Wait, I can't do it.

644
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:08,221
Hand me my towel, please.
Wait, wait.

645
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:09,988
It's super safe. Do it!

646
00:46:11,453 --> 00:46:13,117
You're gonna love it.

647
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:15,229
Will you just shut up?
I just need to concentrate, okay.

648
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,957
What does she need
to concentrate on?

649
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,372
Shut up.

650
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:21,092
Go, Alicia! 1!

651
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:22,653
2...

652
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,963
No, no, no, no.

653
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:27,837
We're gonna count again, okay?

654
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:29,885
No, no, no.

655
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:30,909
Come on.

656
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,965
Yes, you can. You promised.

657
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:33,021
Do it.

658
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:34,237
Sara.

659
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,805
Please come here. Please, I can't.

660
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:36,829
Okay, I'm coming.

661
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,141
No, no, are you crazy?

662
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:41,508
Agustin, just let her go.
Don't babysit her.

663
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:43,812
Sara.

664
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:48,740
Sara.

665
00:46:49,468 --> 00:46:51,331
Are we gonna be here all day?

666
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:52,899
You know it.

667
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,300
Oh, shit, it's really fucking high.

668
00:46:59,613 --> 00:47:01,948
Agustin, come sit down here.

669
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,811
You can take better pictures.

670
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:05,956
Go!

671
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:07,868
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

672
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,149
Wait, wait.

673
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,173
Sara.

674
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:11,292
Yeah?

675
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:12,381
Why don't we jump together?

676
00:47:12,382 --> 00:47:13,661
No, no, no.
There's not enough room.

677
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:15,357
Hey, watch out! Be careful.

678
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:16,604
Push her!

679
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:18,019
Okay, wait.

680
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:25,539
Sara!

681
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,619
Oh!

682
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:30,013
Baby, are you all right?

683
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,069
I'm okay.

684
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,797
You're one of us.

685
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:35,204
Oh! It's so fucking cold.

686
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:38,852
I'm gonna do it. Okay.

687
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:44,035
You should have pushed her.

688
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:46,884
Okay. Come on, watch me, okay?

689
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,116
One...

690
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:56,515
Two...

691
00:47:57,853 --> 00:47:59,268
Three...

692
00:48:07,836 --> 00:48:09,251
Okay.

693
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:12,931
Let's count down.

694
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:17,731
Three, two...

695
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:24,164
One.

696
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,125
Sara, give me your plate.

697
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,013
No, I don't want any more.
I'm fine.

698
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,357
Don't give me that
anorexia bullshit.

699
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:53,085
There's a lot of meat.

700
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:54,397
I have eaten, like, a whole
loaf of bread today, seriously.

701
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,549
Come on, baby. You have to eat.

702
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,443
I'm not hungry.

703
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,661
Alicia?

704
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:08,259
Oh, no, thank you. Okay.

705
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,372
Hey, Barbara. Um...

706
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:16,189
Do you think maybe we could take
Alicia to the doctor tomorrow?

707
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,789
'Cause she's not feeling very well.

708
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,740
What's wrong?

709
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:23,324
No, it's nothing. I just haven't
really been sleeping at all.

710
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:26,499
That's not true.
You always sleep a little.

711
00:49:27,868 --> 00:49:30,564
You're sleeping, so you
forget you're sleeping.

712
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:31,837
Oh.

713
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,429
No, but she got,
like, vertigo today.

714
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,917
She kept us waiting on this
rock for, like, an hour.

715
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:41,604
Remember? "One, two, three..."

716
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:46,340
It's like the fucking
mantra in my head now.

717
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,500
I'll give you some sleeping pills.
You'll feel better tomorrow.

718
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:50,525
Okay.

719
00:49:50,526 --> 00:49:52,067
I'll take one of those.

720
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:58,300
I missed you.

721
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,003
I missed you, too.

722
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:06,236
You know, I almost had to fuck
this prick. Look at that.

723
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:09,316
Am I supposed to take
that as a compliment?

724
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:11,996
Pose.

725
00:50:11,997 --> 00:50:15,459
Don't be so boring. Agustin,
go on the table or something.

726
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:21,923
You guys look weird.

727
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:27,651
What?

728
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,100
Take these pills.
They're gonna make you relax.

729
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:44,572
Tomorrow, we can ask Bernardo

730
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:46,109
if he has some sleeping
pills for you.

731
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,188
Okay, this should work.
Thanks, Barbara.

732
00:50:57,148 --> 00:50:59,484
Oh, fuck. You're not all right.

733
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:02,429
I'm fine. It's okay, it's normal.
This is what happens.

734
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,805
It will be over soon.

735
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:05,731
We're gonna take it
easy tonight, okay?

736
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:07,901
Okay.

737
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:10,525
Or are we having fun tonight?

738
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,939
What?

739
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:17,475
It's all black and infinite.

740
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:23,075
Gravity is pulling down
every cell in your body.

741
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:28,836
The sounds around you melt
together into one golden...

742
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:31,260
Okay, forget it.

743
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:33,596
No, keep going, please.

744
00:51:33,597 --> 00:51:35,452
You laugh at everything I say.

745
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,684
It's the stupid voice that you do.
I can't help it.

746
00:51:38,685 --> 00:51:41,284
Alicia, Alicia.

747
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,147
Let me get rid of that
unpleasant headache of yours.

748
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:50,339
No, I'm gonna be fine.
Your sister gave me these.

749
00:51:51,516 --> 00:51:52,540
What is this shit?

750
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,389
Come on. Just try it.

751
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,020
You'll feel a lot better, come on.

752
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:58,877
Don't be so scared of everything.

753
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:00,124
Brink, stay away.

754
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,244
Come on. Lay down here.

755
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:09,795
Can you put the music down,
please? Just lean back.

756
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:13,629
Relax, close your eyes.

757
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,875
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

758
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:19,907
Breathe deeply.

759
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,067
You haven't slept in so long.

760
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,547
You really want to sleep.

761
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:31,715
Your eyes are tired.

762
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:38,851
Oh, great.

763
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,428
Feel the air coming in.

764
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:46,403
And out.

765
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:51,364
Feel your body resting.

766
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:56,516
Your mind is resting.

767
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:02,788
Alicia.

768
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:07,523
No.

769
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:12,643
Are you hypnotized?

770
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,515
Yes.

771
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,131
Tonight, you will rest.

772
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:24,348
When you go to bed, you
will have a great,

773
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:26,884
deep sleep, okay?

774
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:28,611
Yes.

775
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:32,732
You will now touch the
tip of your nose.

776
00:53:37,341 --> 00:53:39,939
Okay, are you fucking with me?

777
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:41,572
Yes.

778
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:45,028
Alicia, dance to this song.

779
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:14,397
Okay, dance like a whore.

780
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:17,763
<i>I'm in love with your brother</i>

781
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,293
<i>What's his name?</i>

782
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,988
<i>I thought I'd come by</i>

783
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:22,781
<i>To see him again</i>

784
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:24,604
<i>When you two danced</i>

785
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:26,332
<i>Oh, what a dance</i>

786
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,060
<i>When you two laughed</i>

787
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:31,036
<i>Oh, what a laugh
Has he mentioned my..</i>

788
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:35,107
What? God, how many piscos
did you guys give her?

789
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:41,283
Whoa. Okay, Alicia, calm down.

790
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,699
Look how terrified Brink is.

791
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:49,436
Okay, now give Agustin a blowjob.

792
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:52,163
Oh, Brink, why don't you
just do it yourself?

793
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,468
Alicia, stop.

794
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:00,540
What the fuck? The fuck?

795
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,596
Whoa, whoa... Alicia!

796
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:02,620
What the fuck?

797
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:04,869
Hey, Alicia!

798
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:07,996
Are you serious?

799
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:10,468
Hit yourself in the face.

800
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,644
Yes!

801
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,892
Bullshit.

802
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,877
This is getting stupid.
Can we change the music?

803
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,835
Now put your face in the fire.

804
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:23,811
No way.

805
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:27,548
Whoa! Alicia, stop.

806
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:29,500
Fuck!

807
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:31,004
What the fuck?

808
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:33,539
What the fuck?
Get some water or something.

809
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,644
It's okay.

810
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:37,724
Brink, stop fucking filming.

811
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,068
Look at my hand!

812
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,757
What the fuck, guys?
Can you keep quiet?

813
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,796
What the fuck, Barbara?
She really hurt herself.

814
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:47,043
She tripped and she
went in the fire.

815
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:49,500
Oh, my God.

816
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,132
Yeah, exactly.

817
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,540
Barbara.

818
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:56,636
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Alicia.

819
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:01,091
No, no, no, no. I have some medicine.
I have some medicine! Wait.

820
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,324
Is she all right?

821
00:56:03,325 --> 00:56:04,739
No.

822
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,588
It's called craving attention.

823
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:42,716
Sara should be playing with
her more or something.

824
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:46,236
Hey, do all your girlfriends have
crazy relatives or just Sara?

825
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,892
I don't really care about
her social life, you know?

826
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,828
I'm gonna go check on Sara.

827
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:58,659
Good night, buddy.

828
00:57:05,116 --> 00:57:08,508
<i>Okay, Alicia, calm down.</i>

829
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:10,179
Were you drunk?

830
00:57:14,236 --> 00:57:16,316
<i>Okay, now give Agustin a blowjob.</i>

831
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,460
<i>Oh, Brink, why don't you
just do it yourself?</i>

832
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:19,875
Sara.

833
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:30,972
What is she doing?

834
00:57:30,973 --> 00:57:32,124
Is she all right?

835
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,077
Yes, she took a couple
of those pills.

836
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:35,523
Thank God.

837
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:54,788
<i>And I'm so tired of
you, and hearing you,</i>

838
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,684
<i>and drinking all the
booze in the house.</i>

839
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:01,083
<i>I am not gona buy morphine.</i>
You hear that?

840
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,516
<i>I just cannot deal with you guys.</i>

841
00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:04,700
It's not funny.

842
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:06,556
<i>And everybody fucking with.</i>

843
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:08,406
<i>And I cannot deal with you guys.</i>

844
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:19,139
It's not funny.

845
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:58,179
Sara?

846
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:01,284
Alicia?

847
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,963
Yeah?

848
01:00:06,011 --> 01:00:07,427
Yeah.

849
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,315
What's going on?

850
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:10,972
Um...

851
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:13,891
My hand hurts and I can't sleep.

852
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:15,548
It's the room, I think.

853
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:16,962
What?

854
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:18,786
The room?

855
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:22,179
Did you take the pills I gave you?

856
01:00:22,428 --> 01:00:24,194
No, I haven't yet.

857
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:26,012
Well, take them.

858
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:27,907
Yeah, I will. I will.

859
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:51,420
<i>It's too bad Alicia is not here.</i>

860
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:54,588
<i>But it's probably for the best.
Wait, wait. Make up a word.</i>

861
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:56,003
<i>Okay, first word.</i>

862
01:00:57,596 --> 01:00:58,811
<i>Alicia!</i>

863
01:00:58,812 --> 01:01:00,476
<i>What? That sucks.</i>

864
01:01:00,477 --> 01:01:02,434
<i>Alicia's not even a real word.</i>

865
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,516
<i>I'm just so glad Alicia's not here.</i>

866
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:08,860
<i>She's such a drag.</i>

867
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,172
<i>I wish she'd take those
pills more often.</i>

868
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,148
What are you doing? What...

869
01:02:26,588 --> 01:02:28,675
Please! Stop!

870
01:02:30,716 --> 01:02:32,130
Please, no!

871
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:57,379
There's a dog's grave around here.

872
01:02:58,363 --> 01:03:00,668
Fucking creeped me out
when I was a kid.

873
01:03:00,669 --> 01:03:02,082
Oh, here it is.

874
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:03,900
Come on. Your turn.

875
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,179
No, I don't want a picture there.

876
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,812
Why? 'Cause it's weird.

877
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:08,188
What? Come on.

878
01:03:08,189 --> 01:03:09,212
Can we do it now?

879
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:10,683
No, it's going to hurt.

880
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:11,836
Not now. Come on. Let's do it.

881
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:13,052
No, not now.

882
01:03:13,053 --> 01:03:14,460
Let's do it the other way, then.

883
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,643
What? No!

884
01:03:15,644 --> 01:03:16,668
Let's do it the other way.

885
01:03:16,669 --> 01:03:18,083
I don't want to.

886
01:03:28,092 --> 01:03:29,507
Hey.

887
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:42,691
What's with all the mirrors?

888
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:59,811
Weirdest place I've
had sex with Sara?

889
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,147
A dog's grave.

890
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:18,524
Come on. I don't
want to sing alone.

891
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:21,410
I don't want to sing.
I'm not in the mood.

892
01:04:40,379 --> 01:04:41,691
Uh-oh.

893
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:43,068
Shut up.

894
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:44,835
Hey, Alicia.

895
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:49,084
Are you feeling okay?

896
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,140
I'm fine!

897
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:51,842
How's your hand?

898
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:53,698
It's okay.

899
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:17,442
I had a weird moment
with a horse here.

900
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:27,804
Talk about what?

901
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:29,378
You know what it's about.

902
01:05:36,188 --> 01:05:37,211
Alicia!

903
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,626
Yeah?

904
01:05:39,195 --> 01:05:42,619
Hey! What the fuck is your problem?

905
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,156
The next time you want
your pussy eaten out,

906
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,180
you can just ask me!

907
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:46,332
I like pussy!

908
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,452
What the fuck?

909
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:50,076
Shut up! You want them to know?
Really?

910
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,163
What are you talking about?

911
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:52,700
Shut up! You came into my room

912
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:54,588
and you rubbed your
pussy in my face.

913
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:57,083
Who told you to?
Why did you do that?

914
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,611
Get away from me! Sara!

915
01:05:59,612 --> 01:06:01,019
Hey, baby!

916
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,068
This freak grabbed me!

917
01:06:03,069 --> 01:06:05,436
He told me I rubbed
my pussy in his face!

918
01:06:05,437 --> 01:06:06,460
She did! She did!

919
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:07,676
Whatever! She didn't, man.

920
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:09,628
She did! I swear she did!
She did not, okay?

921
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,196
Okay, she didn't.

922
01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:12,220
Fucking asshole!

923
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:14,172
Alicia. I didn't. I didn't!

924
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:15,227
- She did.
- Okay.

925
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:16,571
I hate all of you!

926
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,891
You have to calm down.

927
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:23,388
I can't sleep. I can't sleep.

928
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:25,730
My phone doesn't even work.

929
01:06:27,643 --> 01:06:30,274
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

930
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:33,538
Alicia?

931
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:40,835
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

932
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:45,308
I'm just really...
I'm really tired.

933
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,451
I can't... I can't deal...

934
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:48,475
Alicia?

935
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:50,243
What's happening to me?

936
01:06:56,732 --> 01:06:57,755
No.

937
01:06:57,756 --> 01:07:00,259
Hey, Alicia. Hey!

938
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,179
Alicia, come back!

939
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,026
Alicia!

940
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:12,131
Alicia, stop!

941
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:22,242
Alicia!

942
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:28,962
Alicia.

943
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:32,219
Hey. Hey.

944
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,820
You okay?

945
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:35,451
You okay? It's okay.

946
01:07:50,236 --> 01:07:51,675
Hey, let's go.

947
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:53,212
Let's go to her house.
She can help.

948
01:07:53,213 --> 01:07:54,555
Come on, baby.
She's going to help you.

949
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:56,860
She's going to fix your hand.
Come on.

950
01:07:56,861 --> 01:08:00,931
Come on, I got you.
Come on. You're okay.

951
01:08:01,596 --> 01:08:03,330
I'm sorry.

952
01:08:03,899 --> 01:08:06,339
I didn't mean what
I said out there.

953
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,834
Huh?

954
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:58,492
You're feeling better?

955
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:02,658
Yeah, she put some herbal
ointment on my hand.

956
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:06,843
Hey, I'm making tea.
Do you want some?

957
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:15,932
Let's take you upstairs.

958
01:09:15,933 --> 01:09:17,883
No, it's fine. I can go by myself.

959
01:09:17,884 --> 01:09:19,490
Okay.

960
01:09:32,028 --> 01:09:35,067
That girl is freaking me out.

961
01:09:35,068 --> 01:09:36,635
Is she possessed, or what the fuck?

962
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:39,195
She's sick. She's,
like, mentally ill.

963
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:41,531
She needs to be
medicated, or something.

964
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:43,323
No, she just needs some sleep.

965
01:09:43,324 --> 01:09:44,891
Maybe when I hypnotized her,

966
01:09:44,892 --> 01:09:46,396
like, something got inside her.

967
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:48,283
Barbara, she's like a
pathological liar.

968
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,867
Last night, she came into my room...
No. Brink, shut up, okay?

969
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:54,172
She's not a bad person, you guys.

970
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:55,803
I know her, okay.

971
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:58,683
Then why don't you talk
some sense into her?

972
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:01,148
She just needs a doctor.

973
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:02,235
For her hand.

974
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:04,507
Yeah, right. "For her hand."

975
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:07,931
The nearest hospital
is 5 hours away.

976
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:09,858
And you're not taking the truck.

977
01:10:13,436 --> 01:10:14,651
Hey, Alicia.

978
01:10:14,652 --> 01:10:16,418
Hey, you want me to run you a bath?

979
01:10:19,036 --> 01:10:20,802
I'm okay, guys.

980
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,036
I promise I'm not sick.

981
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:25,467
No, we know, baby.

982
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:28,066
Let's just make the tea
that that woman gave me.

983
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:30,427
I'm okay, really.

984
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:31,739
I believe you.

985
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,794
- Just make the tea.
- Okay.

986
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:38,434
Let's go upstairs.

987
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:56,419
Alicia?

988
01:11:02,907 --> 01:11:04,219
Hey.

989
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,843
Were you asleep? I'm sorry.
Keep sleeping, baby.

990
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:08,699
That tea really worked.

991
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,427
That's good. Go back
to sleep. I'm sorry.

992
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,779
What are you doing in here?

993
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,891
Whatever. I'm looking
through Alicia's bag.

994
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:47,419
I found weird shit, Sara.
She has all these pills.

995
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,147
Do you know what these are for?

996
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:51,419
No. People take medication
for all kinds of shit.

997
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,499
Why don't you know
what she takes it for?

998
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,843
Come on. You're being
a drama queen.

999
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:56,860
Strange behavior.

1000
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:59,163
Just be quiet. We don't want to wake
her up. We finally have some peace.

1001
01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:00,827
Does she get crazy on her
period or something?

1002
01:12:00,828 --> 01:12:02,075
Just be quiet, all right?

1003
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,955
Why is it "gentle glide
for insertion comfort"?

1004
01:12:04,956 --> 01:12:06,011
What is she so afraid of?

1005
01:12:06,012 --> 01:12:07,426
Shut up!

1006
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:59,131
Is your guy pretending to be happy?

1007
01:12:59,132 --> 01:13:00,476
Or smiling for real?

1008
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,843
He's definitely
pretending to smile.

1009
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:04,699
That's like half of them.

1010
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,123
Does yours look like she's had
really bad plastic surgery?

1011
01:13:08,124 --> 01:13:10,780
No, it's not Susan.

1012
01:13:10,781 --> 01:13:13,339
Listen, it says here that
hypnosis is used sometimes

1013
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,876
to treat mental illnesses.

1014
01:13:14,877 --> 01:13:16,379
But it doesn't trigger it.

1015
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,843
Does she have any crazy
relatives, or something?

1016
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:20,283
No. You're just being dramatic.

1017
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:22,683
She's feeling much better now. Go.

1018
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:25,243
Shouldn't someone be with
her in case she wakes up?

1019
01:13:25,244 --> 01:13:26,627
Barbara.

1020
01:13:28,668 --> 01:13:31,970
Okay, is yours using
their eyebrow muscles?

1021
01:13:35,227 --> 01:13:37,435
Wait a second.
I'm going to go check on her.

1022
01:13:37,436 --> 01:13:39,355
Bring back some of
those pills we found!

1023
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:40,411
What pills?

1024
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:42,626
It doesn't matter.
And some more ice!

1025
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:06,786
Agustin.

1026
01:14:07,835 --> 01:14:10,875
She ate all of these
Barbara pills. Like 15!

1027
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:12,513
Shit. Agustin, come here.

1028
01:14:13,595 --> 01:14:15,393
What the fuck is this?

1029
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:18,427
Did you see this, man?

1030
01:14:18,428 --> 01:14:19,803
What the fuck?

1031
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:22,011
The smiley face? Fuck.

1032
01:14:22,012 --> 01:14:23,579
Agustin, stop laughing.

1033
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,115
This is really starting
to freak me out.

1034
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:26,395
Did you guys look downstairs?

1035
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:28,859
Yes, I looked everywhere.
Except for Barbara's room.

1036
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,995
Yeah, let's keep Barbara
out of this, okay?

1037
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:34,683
What the fuck!
Why is she doing this to me?

1038
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:37,147
This is stupid! Why would
she come down to the beach?

1039
01:14:37,148 --> 01:14:39,067
Fuck! I don't know.
Do you have a better idea?

1040
01:14:39,068 --> 01:14:41,371
Yeah, maybe she's at the
neighbors' house, or something.

1041
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:42,555
Alicia!

1042
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:43,803
Don't you call out to her, Brink!

1043
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:45,115
You're just going to
freak her out even more.

1044
01:14:45,116 --> 01:14:46,299
Come on, guys.
Hurry up! Help me here.

1045
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,714
Don't fucking do that!

1046
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:52,514
Alicia!

1047
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:16,117
We'll find her, okay?

1048
01:15:19,259 --> 01:15:20,483
Bernardo?

1049
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,274
Alicia!

1050
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,394
Alicia!

1051
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:42,114
Brink?

1052
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:45,595
Brink, do you copy?

1053
01:15:45,596 --> 01:15:48,667
<i>Hell yes, we're at
the tennis court!</i>

1054
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:51,611
Hey, come on. Let's go look
for her on the Fat Hill.

1055
01:15:51,612 --> 01:15:53,475
Come on. No. No.

1056
01:15:57,371 --> 01:16:00,763
Guys, dinner is ready.

1057
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:11,970
1. 2.

1058
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:14,850
3.

1059
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:22,082
1. 2.

1060
01:16:24,507 --> 01:16:26,113
3.

1061
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:29,538
Alicia!

1062
01:17:32,762 --> 01:17:34,754
Alicia!

1063
01:17:36,795 --> 01:17:38,363
Hey!

1064
01:17:38,364 --> 01:17:40,379
Wait, did you hear that? Sara!

1065
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,563
Alicia!

1066
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:42,970
Sara, do you hear that?

1067
01:17:42,971 --> 01:17:44,411
Sara, I'm here! What?

1068
01:17:44,412 --> 01:17:46,914
No, it's coming from the water.

1069
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:53,019
Alicia!

1070
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,594
Sara!

1071
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,771
Okay, guys, watch me.
I'm going to do it now.

1072
01:17:59,772 --> 01:18:00,827
What are you doing?

1073
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:02,235
We found her. She's on the rock!

1074
01:18:02,236 --> 01:18:04,442
Hey. Come back up here.

1075
01:18:04,443 --> 01:18:05,531
What are you doing?

1076
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:06,939
She's on the rock! She's jumping...

1077
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,115
Alicia, you have to come back up.

1078
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,747
Please. We're sorry.

1079
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:12,378
Just come back up
and we'll go home,

1080
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,235
and everything is going
to be fine, okay?

1081
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:15,899
Please. We'll go back to California.

1082
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,331
And you can forget about this place,
and it's going to be sunny...

1083
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:20,058
Hey, where is she? Agustin!

1084
01:18:20,059 --> 01:18:21,722
Agustin!

1085
01:18:21,723 --> 01:18:24,154
Alicia, just walk back slowly, okay?
Don't yell at her.

1086
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:25,659
I promise I'm going to do it. Okay?

1087
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,682
No, no, no, no!

1088
01:18:26,683 --> 01:18:27,707
- 1, 2...
- Don't move!

1089
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:29,249
- ...3!
- Alicia!

1090
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:54,170
Is she fine? Is she fine?

1091
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:57,179
Hey, just give her room.
Get out of the way, man!

1092
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,579
There was a sheep and it fell.

1093
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,027
What is she talking about?

1094
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:11,450
Sara! Sara!

1095
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,249
Bring my clothes!

1096
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,219
Agustin, why aren't
we taking her home?

1097
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,666
Melda!

1098
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,058
Sara, where are you? Where are you?

1099
01:19:30,138 --> 01:19:31,899
It's me, Alicia.

1100
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,113
It's okay. It's okay.

1101
01:19:43,804 --> 01:19:46,299
Agustin, tell them we need a doctor.

1102
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:53,051
What are they giving her?

1103
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:56,699
Just sleeping pills, tell her.
I don't want it.

1104
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,938
Just give her 1!
3 is too many!

1105
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:15,931
Wait, where are you going?

1106
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:17,115
I'm gonna get the car keys.
See you at the dock.

1107
01:20:21,626 --> 01:20:23,233
Agustin?

1108
01:20:23,802 --> 01:20:25,083
Wait! Agustin!

1109
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,841
I'm going to get the car keys.
Wait.

1110
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:40,443
Alicia, it's Sara. It's me.
It's okay.

1111
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:41,530
You're my friend.

1112
01:20:41,531 --> 01:20:43,610
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.

1113
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:45,346
You're my friend.

1114
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:46,946
Melda?

1115
01:20:54,618 --> 01:20:56,737
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1116
01:20:57,402 --> 01:21:00,450
It's not your fault. It's me.

1117
01:21:03,803 --> 01:21:07,041
Alicia, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1118
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,690
What's wrong, baby? What's wrong?

1119
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:32,603
Make it stop, Sara!

1120
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:34,363
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1121
01:21:34,364 --> 01:21:35,995
Make it stop. Make it stop.

1122
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:37,083
What do you need?
What do you need?

1123
01:21:37,084 --> 01:21:38,778
Please turn on the music!

1124
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:40,635
Tell her to shut up!

1125
01:21:40,636 --> 01:21:42,107
What do you need?

1126
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:45,179
You want the music?
Agustin, put the music on!

1127
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,587
Put the fucking music on!

1128
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:48,226
Okay. Okay.

1129
01:22:00,058 --> 01:22:04,322
<i>Folks, here's the story
'bout Minnie the Moocher</i>

1130
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:08,858
<i>She was the roughest,
toughest frail</i>

1131
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:12,186
<i>But Minnie had a
heart as big as...</i>

1132
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:15,643
Agustin, where the fuck are we?
Where the fuck are we?

1133
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:17,819
Sara, you're stressing me out!

1134
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,258
We have to trust Melda!

1135
01:22:19,259 --> 01:22:21,563
She needs to go to a hospital.

1136
01:22:21,564 --> 01:22:24,283
No, not now! We can't go to a
hospital now. She'll just have to wait.

1137
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:31,642
Relax. Everything is
going to be fine.

1138
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:33,498
She needs to go to
a fucking hospital.

1139
01:22:33,499 --> 01:22:35,713
We can't go to a hospital now!
We're here!

1140
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:49,454
- What is she saying?
- Shut up!

1141
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:57,115
Ugh!

1142
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,457
Agustin. Oh, my God. What is that?

1143
01:24:03,994 --> 01:24:06,242
Baby. I'm sorry.

1144
01:27:18,138 --> 01:27:19,905
What's wrong?

1145
01:27:22,747 --> 01:27:24,404
What's wrong?

1146
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,113
Alicia.

1147
01:27:27,195 --> 01:27:28,609
What's happening?

1148
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,762
What's she saying?

1149
01:27:58,363 --> 01:28:00,578
What's happening, please?

1150
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,833
She's dead!

1151
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,170
She's dead!

1152
01:28:18,171 --> 01:28:19,738
No! No, she's not.
No, she's not.

1153
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,274
She has done this before, okay?

1154
01:28:21,275 --> 01:28:22,427
She is alive.

1155
01:28:22,428 --> 01:28:25,242
Listen, her soul will
come back to her body.

1156
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:27,810
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1157
01:29:33,147 --> 01:29:36,801
Please come back, baby.
Come back. Please come back.
