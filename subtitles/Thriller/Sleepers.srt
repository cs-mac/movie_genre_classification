1
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:19,033
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

2
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:23,955
This is my story & that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:28,877
Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

4
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:33,089
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

5
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,759
...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

6
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:42,557
I'm the only one who could speak for
them... and the children we were.

7
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,994
My three friends and
I were inseparable...

8
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,955
...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

9
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:32,166
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

10
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,880
...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

11
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:41,718
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

12
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,761
Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

13
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:47,390
and Eastern European labourers.
Hard men living hard lives.

14
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,612
We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

15
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,656
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

16
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,666
I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

17
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,759
Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

18
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,470
Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

19
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,555
The will of the Church was forceful.

20
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:30,683
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

21
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,855
Yet, despite the harshness of life...

22
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,108
...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

23
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,818
...enjoyed by few other neighbourhoods.

24
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:45,073
Crimes against people of the
neighbourhood were not permitted.

25
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:48,159
When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

26
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:50,078
...and, in some cases, final.

27
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,082
A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

28
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,544
A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

29
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,338
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

30
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:05,218
Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence... ruled by corruption.

31
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,890
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

32
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,767
We each served as altar boys.

33
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,228
Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

34
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,188
since the funeral included a $3 fee...

35
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:19,566
...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

36
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,820
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

37
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,572
...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

38
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,992
Two weeks into the new school year,

39
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:31,035
I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

40
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:32,871
...and I was ready for the big leagues.

41
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:36,916
In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

42
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,252
...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

43
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,671
...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

44
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,924
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

45
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:58,855
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

46
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,274
And you will receive the gifts...

47
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:02,775
...of the Holy Spirit.

48
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,993
It's gonna be a great day and your...

49
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,496
...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptised...

50
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,333
...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

51
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:20,293
-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

52
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:22,462
What clacker?

53
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:23,296
Now!

54
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,840
Let everyone rise.

55
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:30,303
Let us pray.

56
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,940
Nuns are such easy targets.

57
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,319
John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

58
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,405
We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

59
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:52,325
And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

60
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,869
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

61
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,622
...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

62
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,291
Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

63
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,669
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

64
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:04,504
...committed by people we knew.

65
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,091
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

66
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,300
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

67
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:11,886
What if our mothers are out there?

68
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,514
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

69
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,224
What if we hear something worse?

70
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,725
Like what?

71
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:21,104
Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

72
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:25,608
Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

73
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,327
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

74
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,955
I... sleep with married men.

75
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:41,833
Men with families.

76
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,088
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

77
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:50,967
Yes?

78
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:55,471
You see, I'm... I'm pregnant.

79
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,810
The father?

80
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,145
Take a number.

81
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,980
What are you going to do?

82
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,524
I know what you want me to do.

83
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,860
And I know what I should do.

84
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,197
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

85
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,409
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:20,163
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

87
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,373
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

88
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,089
She knew.

89
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,008
Yeah, she knew.

90
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,052
Why do you think she told us all that?

91
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:37,722
I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

92
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,604
Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

93
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,440
...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

94
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,734
...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

95
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,446
He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

96
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:56,282
He was a friend... a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

97
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,867
You know what crap like
that does to your body?

98
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:01,454
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

99
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:05,416
Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

100
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:07,293
No, nothing.

101
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,254
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

102
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:10,296
Who says?

103
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,175
Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

104
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,553
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

105
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:17,595
You don't?

106
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,306
Maybe I got the wrong information.

107
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:21,891
I guess you did.

108
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,019
I'll see you later tonight.

109
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:26,688
What's tonight?

110
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,607
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

111
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,609
...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighbourhood.

112
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:32,944
Your mother said you'd love to help.

113
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,612
I bet she did.

114
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:40,785
Shakes... I don't want you
getting into any trouble.

115
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:42,954
Come on, Father, you know I never do.

116
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,164
That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

117
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:46,374
That's it?

118
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,209
That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

119
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,961
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

120
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,922
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

121
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:53,965
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,133
All right... see you.

123
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:02,056
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

124
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:04,726
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

125
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:09,230
But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

126
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:12,317
Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

127
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,860
her mother having died at childbirth.

128
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,739
Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

129
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,657
We could always count on Carol...

130
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,951
...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

131
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:24,704
While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

132
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:25,914
...waiting to see the skaters perform...

133
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,333
...we each had one eye in a hole...

134
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,960
...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

135
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,462
...get into their skaters' outfits.

136
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,258
This is what heaven must be about.

137
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,769
Carol, you want to take a look?

138
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,230
Like it's something I haven't seen?

139
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,899
You're so lucky!

140
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:58,446
She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

141
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,281
When my friends and I were young,

142
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:02,367
...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

143
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:06,788
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

144
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,124
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

145
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,627
But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

146
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,339
There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

147
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:20,468
...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

148
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,805
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

149
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:27,392
I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

150
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:29,519
As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

151
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,981
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

152
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,693
And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

153
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,738
...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

154
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:42,615
...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

155
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,577
King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

156
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,245
You know what King Benny does?

157
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:52,041
He waits. He waits 8 years...

158
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,585
...to get even with that prick.

159
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,045
He walks into a public bath house.

160
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:57,338
The guy's soaking in the tub.

161
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:02,552
King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

162
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,514
Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

163
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:11,561
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

164
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:13,771
Then he pulls out a gun...

165
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,066
...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

166
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:21,779
Then he says to the guy:

167
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:25,950
"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

168
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:29,787
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

169
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,123
Revenge!

170
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,001
Revenge!

171
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,131
Can I talk to you for a minute?

172
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:43,676
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

173
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:46,679
You're the butcher's kid... am I right?

174
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,850
What kind of a job are you looking for?

175
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,560
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

176
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,604
It doesn't matter?

177
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,942
Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

178
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,652
Who is everybody?

179
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,529
People from the neighbourhood.

180
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,616
Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

181
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,785
They know you got jobs.

182
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,209
Sorry I wasted your time.

183
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,795
Hold on a sec!

184
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,507
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

185
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,509
-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

186
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:25,718
You'll be here?

187
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:27,679
I'm always here.

188
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,856
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

189
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:39,858
...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

190
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,653
In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

191
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,281
...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

192
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,825
It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

193
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,370
Come on, let's go! Right here.

194
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,080
Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

195
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,416
You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

196
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,710
Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

197
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,755
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

198
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:07,218
Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

199
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,095
This time they took my money!

200
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,763
You took the money from the boy?

201
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,015
The money they took is in the bag.

202
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,849
Let me have the bag.

203
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:13,683
Fuck you!

204
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:15,977
How about now?

205
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,228
All right, take it easy.

206
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:21,232
You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

207
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,358
Let me have the bag.

208
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:27,071
Now, go!

209
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:28,114
What about them?

210
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:28,948
You care?

211
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:31,826
Then go! Go! Run!

212
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,663
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

213
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:37,332
What you need?

214
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:38,833
My friends.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,920
Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

216
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,756
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

217
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,635
Okay, get your friends.

218
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,430
Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

219
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,517
He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

220
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,268
...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

221
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,312
He didn't want that to happen to us.

222
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,773
You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

223
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,607
It pays.

224
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,983
A lot of things pay.

225
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:04,984
Not like this.

226
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:09,614
Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

227
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:13,243
Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

228
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:14,869
Good shot!

229
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,581
I found an art class for you to take.

230
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:20,250
You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

231
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,669
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

232
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,922
It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

233
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,841
Maybe, or it could be the first step.

234
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,133
First step to what?

235
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,343
Doing something with your life.

236
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,011
You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

237
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:32,929
You all can get out of here.

238
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:34,848
Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

239
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,018
Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

240
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,855
It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

241
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:45,108
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

242
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,734
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

243
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:50,405
He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

244
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,783
Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

245
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,119
Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

246
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,745
...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

247
00:15:57,954 --> 00:15:59,622
It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

248
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,249
Well, for Michelangelo it was.

249
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,501
Michelangelo needed the job...

250
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,628
...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

251
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:09,090
And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

252
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,883
What's his father?

253
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:13,720
He was like a low-level... con guy.

254
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,430
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

255
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:16,264
Goats?

256
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,765
Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

257
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:18,600
-Chickens?
-Chickens?

258
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:19,976
You know what happened?

259
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,271
He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

260
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,315
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

261
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:27,400
Did he pay off the loans?

262
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,693
Every single one of them.

263
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,779
How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

264
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:33,448
It took him about 9 years.

265
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:34,866
9 years!?

266
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:36,201
That's a big ceiling!

267
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,329
I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

268
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:40,455
And he had a bum leg.

269
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,832
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

270
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,711
Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

271
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,004
You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

272
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,048
Sixteenth Chapel?

273
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:51,007
Who painted the other fifteen?

274
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:03,978
Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

275
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,898
...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

276
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,485
Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

277
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:14,239
...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

278
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:16,783
...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

279
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,409
...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

280
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,870
...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

281
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:24,666
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

282
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,211
...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

283
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,509
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

284
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:38,429
...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

285
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:41,266
...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

286
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:46,229
For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

287
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:50,608
They might as well have occurred in
another country... in another century.

288
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,361
Our attention was elsewhere.

289
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,407
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

290
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:59,075
...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

291
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:02,078
A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

292
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,582
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

293
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,463
Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

294
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,174
I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

295
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:14,883
John Reilly.

296
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,301
The little punk!

297
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:18,970
He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

298
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,471
You put him in the hospital.

299
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:24,142
He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

300
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,769
What are you? About 220, 230?

301
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:31,107
You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weights?

302
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,028
80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

303
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:38,198
If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

304
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,826
Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

305
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:44,412
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

306
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:48,917
And I may not be in your division, but
I do weight more than 85 pounds.

307
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,795
And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

308
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,006
...to pray over your body.

309
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,595
See you in church.

310
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:08,770
Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

311
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:11,606
It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

312
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,737
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

313
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,406
...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

314
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,410
Come on, Davy... take this chump out.
He got nothing!

315
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:25,370
Shut up!

316
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:26,746
Who's that?

317
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,081
His sister.

318
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:29,916
What happened to her?

319
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,253
I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

320
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:34,587
Worry about the game, come on.

321
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:38,299
Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

322
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,677
He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

323
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,971
Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

324
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,556
This is it... home run!

325
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:47,225
Easy, Mike.

326
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,978
What the fuck you
looking at, little dick!?

327
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,313
She's nothing but charm.

328
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,774
Come on, Davy!

329
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,276
You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

330
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:58,611
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

331
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,697
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

332
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,699
You could've helped her
across the street...

333
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,950
...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

334
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,201
You didn't have to throw the game.

335
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:07,620
Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

336
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,956
You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

337
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,667
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

338
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,086
He's no better than you.

339
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:16,713
He was today.

340
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:18,381
No. You let him be.

341
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,926
All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

342
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,095
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

343
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,640
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

344
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,976
And when it does, it's
going to hurt... bad.

345
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:33,688
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

346
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,231
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

347
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,942
Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

348
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:39,485
Do you see that street?

349
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:43,239
That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetisers.

350
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:46,743
Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

351
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:49,329
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

352
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,665
Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

353
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:56,169
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

354
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:58,379
All right, all right, calm down.

355
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:00,548
It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

356
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:02,133
Be funny, limp dick.

357
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,469
Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

358
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:06,304
You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

359
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,306
Thanks a lot, fat man.

360
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,810
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

361
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,896
But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

362
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:17,398
...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

363
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:19,400
...was more than the right thing to do.

364
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,537
Come on, let's go swimming.

365
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,956
The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

366
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,250
...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

367
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,378
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

368
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:40,755
a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

369
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,924
Can't you feel the breeze up here?

370
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,009
What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

371
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,094
The devil couldn't stand this heat.

372
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:47,470
Will you guys shut up, please?

373
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:48,763
I'm trying to get my burn.

374
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,265
It's 98 degrees!

375
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,017
-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

376
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,353
We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

377
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,731
I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

378
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:02,777
I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

379
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:06,489
We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air... choose.

380
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:10,159
Air is probably safer, Mike.

381
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,620
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

382
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,831
Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

383
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:16,249
Yours!

384
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,419
-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

385
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,254
-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

386
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,422
-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

387
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,591
-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

388
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:25,425
I'm not going.

389
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:26,593
-Why?
-It's too hot.

390
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:28,678
If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

391
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,142
Mustard and onions. No soda.

392
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:35,768
I know you!

393
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:37,604
I look like a lot of people.

394
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,772
The scam was simple.

395
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:43,359
I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

396
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:47,197
The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

397
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,533
This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

398
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:54,162
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

399
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:56,497
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

400
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,583
...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

401
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:03,463
I'm gonna need two napkins?

402
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,758
Pay my money, thief!

403
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,350
Wow! Ketchup!

404
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,768
I took it from him and ran!

405
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:21,022
I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

406
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:25,693
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

407
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:28,279
You gonna give me two?

408
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,750
You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

409
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:43,920
Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

410
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,421
They're heavier than shit!

411
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:47,757
Think we can push it, the three of us?

412
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,801
Push it where?

413
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:53,054
A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

414
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,890
...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

415
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:19,122
The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

416
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,124
I was on the other side of the street.

417
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,211
He was beat... but not beaten.

418
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:28,298
He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

419
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,051
Give it up.

420
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:46,232
What's wrong, Mikey?

421
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,361
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

422
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:53,031
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

423
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:58,203
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

424
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:00,747
-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

425
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,873
He still near?

426
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:04,417
I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

427
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:09,005
The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

428
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:12,091
We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

429
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:14,427
Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

430
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:16,554
We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

431
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,891
Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

432
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,644
To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

433
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,562
But, we would all pay a price.

434
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:29,275
It only took a minute... but
in that minute... everything changed.

435
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:31,528
Guys, I can't hold it!

436
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:33,404
-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

437
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,449
I can't hold it!

438
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,090
Stop! God, no! !

439
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:15,697
Damn!

440
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:25,081
Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

441
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:28,168
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

442
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,586
I think we just killed a man.

443
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:38,219
While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

444
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:42,807
...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

445
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,767
I'm sorry, dad.

446
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:46,477
'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

447
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:50,815
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

448
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,402
You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

449
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,196
Mom, tell him to calm down, mom!

450
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:58,698
Mario, stop it!

451
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,367
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

452
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:06,039
Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

453
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,525
I hear you're short an altar boy.

454
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,571
You still remember what to do?

455
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:42,784
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

456
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:45,995
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

457
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:48,957
Get ready... we got 5 minutes
till show time.

458
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:03,471
I'm gonna miss this.

459
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,017
I'm gonna miss all of this.

460
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,481
I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

461
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:21,739
I could run... we all could run.

462
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:26,077
Disappear for a while.

463
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:28,454
Nobody's gonna come looking.

464
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,586
Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

465
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,886
You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

466
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,641
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

467
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,270
You've gotta face this.

468
00:28:58,693 --> 00:28:59,777
I can't, Father.

469
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:03,865
I don't want to face it.

470
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,744
I'm too scared to face it.

471
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:10,872
I'm scared, too.

472
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:15,835
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

473
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:22,800
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

474
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,220
You understand?

475
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,560
Come on. We got an audience.

476
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:43,029
I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

477
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:48,409
Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

478
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,747
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

479
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:00,338
This is one of my favourites.

480
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:02,674
What is?

481
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:08,429
"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren... you do to me."

482
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:14,102
Come on.

483
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,777
We never saw the vendor as a man...

484
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,488
...not the way we saw other
men of the neighbourhood.

485
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,783
And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

486
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:33,496
We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

487
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:36,416
...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

488
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,252
We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

489
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:43,339
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

490
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:49,762
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

491
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,765
...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

492
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:54,809
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

493
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:59,439
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

494
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,358
...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

495
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:03,818
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,695
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

497
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,824
Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

498
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:11,993
...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

499
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,163
...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

500
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,542
...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

501
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,295
Michael Sullivan.

502
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:24,756
The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

503
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,508
...for a period of no more than
18 months...

504
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,968
...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

505
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,971
And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

506
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,225
...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

507
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,936
...I would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

508
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,356
I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

509
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:44,025
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

510
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:48,863
Could you do me a favour?

511
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:50,406
What do you want? Name it.

512
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,784
The past couple of weeks...

513
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,537
...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

514
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:57,539
Could you watch over them for me?

515
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:58,581
I will.

516
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:03,086
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

517
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:04,963
You mean, you want me to lie?

518
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:09,634
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

519
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:13,930
Come on, let's go.

520
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:16,766
Be strong.

521
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:18,142
I will.

522
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,142
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

523
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,227
...housed in 5 separate units.

524
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:04,814
From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

525
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,316
...wanted it to resemble...

526
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,194
...some kind of nice
school or university.

527
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:14,574
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

528
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:19,662
We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

529
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:23,541
...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

530
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,544
...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

531
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,549
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

532
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:44,771
Hello, Carcaterra.

533
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:47,941
Toss your clothes on the floor.

534
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:49,734
Here?

535
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:52,153
Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

536
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:53,279
Now, lose the clothes.

537
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:55,156
In front of you?

538
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:04,916
Let's go, let's go!

539
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,304
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

540
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,932
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

541
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:24,310
I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

542
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,032
Everything.

543
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:40,702
You want me to stand here naked?

544
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:41,995
Now you're catching on.

545
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:45,540
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

546
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,465
Now, what?

547
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:58,303
Get dressed.

548
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:05,852
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

549
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,355
...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

550
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,860
Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

551
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:15,945
...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

552
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,280
...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

553
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:21,784
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

554
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:24,871
Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

555
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:27,081
...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

556
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,544
It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

557
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:33,880
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

558
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,799
A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

559
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:40,595
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

560
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:44,098
And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

561
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:22,220
What the fuck did you do that for?

562
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:25,056
You got close to me.

563
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:26,224
So?

564
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:28,476
It bothers me.

565
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:32,397
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

566
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,164
You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

567
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,251
You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

568
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,003
...the day you walked in here.

569
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,259
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

570
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:44,427
There's nothing to see.

571
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,348
Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

572
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:51,809
Go on.

573
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,530
That go for me too?

574
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,532
No, it don't go for you.

575
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:10,411
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

576
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,208
You and me... we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

577
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,668
Maybe at dinner.

578
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:21,256
So... you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

579
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:25,051
I got to smell it.

580
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,388
You got to smell it...

581
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:32,725
That's good.

582
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,186
Where you going?

583
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:37,230
You said to get lunch.

584
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:41,276
You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

585
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,778
...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

586
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:45,947
You could smell it.

587
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:52,787
I'm not hungry.

588
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:56,082
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

589
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,918
You eat... because I'm
telling you to eat.

590
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,216
I'm still not hungry.

591
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:13,391
I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

592
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:14,434
Now, eat.

593
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:20,148
Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

594
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:24,569
Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

595
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:29,616
Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

596
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:33,828
You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

597
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,832
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

598
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:39,792
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

599
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:45,673
None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

600
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,968
You got that? Hey you...

601
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:52,096
There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

602
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,433
Come on now, that's good.

603
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:58,019
Show the boys how you follow my rules.

604
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:00,522
Rules! You understand?

605
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:04,359
Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

606
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,277
Your shift's over, Nokes.

607
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:11,032
I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

608
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,326
...I gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

609
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:16,538
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

610
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:18,540
Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

611
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,709
This one, I'm staying in.

612
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:27,549
Don't fuck with me, boy.

613
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:32,762
No, Nokes... you fuck with me.

614
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,765
I'm asking you.

615
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:44,232
You're eating into my shift.

616
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,738
I'll get out of your way... for now.

617
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,533
I'll take what I can get.

618
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,745
You boys get off your knees.

619
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,720
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

620
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:17,599
I don't understand you boys.

621
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,893
I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

622
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,228
You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

623
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:25,690
I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

624
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,485
...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

625
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,864
And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

626
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,284
You had rules, and you had discipline.

627
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:42,415
Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

628
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:47,253
Right around there to the right.
There you go.

629
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,389
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

630
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,809
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

631
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,276
We understand each other?

632
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:12,278
Turn and face the wall.

633
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:24,958
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

634
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,836
...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

635
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,597
What do you want?

636
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,226
A blow job.

637
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:52,694
Down on your knees.

638
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:58,616
Face the wall.

639
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:18,386
There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

640
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:21,097
I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

641
00:43:22,223 --> 00:43:24,851
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

642
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:26,436
...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

643
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:28,938
...and the end of my childhood.

644
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,118
Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

645
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:45,288
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

646
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:46,414
...all that had happened to me.

647
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,959
Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

648
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,128
Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

649
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,297
John's mother came up once a month.

650
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:00,386
But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

651
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,642
So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

652
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,895
Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

653
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,190
If we did, reprisals would be severe.

654
00:44:27,038 --> 00:44:28,581
You lost a few pounds.

655
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,917
It's not exactly home cooking.

656
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:33,294
Sit down.

657
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:36,464
This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

658
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:40,635
I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

659
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,263
I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

660
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,098
...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

661
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:48,476
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

662
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:51,771
Anything at all?

663
00:44:54,148 --> 00:44:55,525
You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

664
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,904
I appreciate it and all, but...

665
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,782
...I don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

666
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:31,019
I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

667
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:33,938
You have any friends not in jail?

668
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:37,483
Not as many as I would like.

669
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,320
What's he in for?

670
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:45,742
Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

671
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:48,203
And he's a good friend?

672
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:49,996
He's my best friend.

673
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,042
We hung out together.

674
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,086
We were close...
just like you and the guys.

675
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:10,892
We were both sent up here.

676
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:19,317
That's right. And it wasn't easy...

677
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,404
...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

678
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,536
This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

679
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,668
Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

680
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,088
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

681
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,091
I've got to go, Father.

682
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:52,767
I'll see you in the Kitchen.

683
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,145
I'm counting on you.

684
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:00,775
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

685
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,655
Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

686
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,451
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

687
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:15,540
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,632
I didn't want to let him go.

689
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,510
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

690
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,687
A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

691
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,731
...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

692
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,233
There were other cries, too.

693
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,361
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

694
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,657
They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

695
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,453
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

696
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,081
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

697
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:00,418
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

698
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,837
...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

699
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,440
I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

700
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:26,319
There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

701
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:31,157
This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

702
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,997
I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

703
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,166
Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

704
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,760
-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

705
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,763
No. You did a great
job on your book report.

706
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,852
You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

707
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:02,355
It's my favourite.
I like it more since I've been here.

708
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:03,773
Why is that?

709
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,987
It's like... he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

710
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,658
Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

711
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,702
And he learned from it.

712
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:19,998
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

713
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,460
-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

714
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:28,173
You got a copy of the book at home?

715
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,675
I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

716
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,011
No, it's not the same thing.

717
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,014
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

718
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,850
I've got something for you.

719
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,061
I thought you might like to have it.

720
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:44,022
Are you serious?

721
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,025
Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

722
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,111
-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

723
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,614
You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

724
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,865
It's been a while.

725
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:58,411
-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

726
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,248
That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

727
00:50:03,124 --> 00:50:04,501
You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

728
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,794
Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

729
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,713
...think the Count can
hold their attention.

730
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,215
He's got a shot.

731
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,342
Any particular section
I should read from?

732
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:15,762
That's easy... the part where
he escapes from prison.

733
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:32,278
There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

734
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:44,332
It was only a game... just a touch
football game, nothing more.

735
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,918
But a game I wish we
had never played.

736
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,798
Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

737
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,801
Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

738
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,011
We had a 2 hour practice.

739
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,138
It didn't matter much.

740
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,517
We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

741
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:04,644
Who's the toughest guy here?

742
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,855
How do you mean, tough?

743
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,023
Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

744
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:11,192
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

745
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:16,656
Michael saw an opening... a chance
to bring the game to our level.

746
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,827
Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

747
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,748
Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

748
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,669
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

749
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,088
I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

750
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,882
...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

751
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:34,716
Why?

752
00:51:35,049 --> 00:51:36,050
Look man...

753
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,052
...guards stay clear of me, all right?

754
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:39,721
They stay back and let me do my time.

755
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:41,890
If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

756
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,683
...they just might change my cushion.

757
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,061
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

758
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,563
You do every day.

759
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,567
-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

760
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,781
They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

761
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:00,200
You're just an animal to them.

762
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:04,037
-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

763
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,915
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

764
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,958
Then why, white boy, why?

765
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:13,505
To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

766
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,509
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

767
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,844
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,179
I call heads.

769
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,309
He called heads.
It is a head.

770
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:29,187
Let's go.

771
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,784
You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

772
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,505
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

773
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,175
We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

774
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,844
This shit feels good.

775
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:08,852
Fuck!

776
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,277
Get the fuck off me!

777
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,374
Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

778
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,046
For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

779
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,591
...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

780
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:41,885
...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

781
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,305
...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighbourhoods we'd come from.

782
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,392
For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

783
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,746
Rizzo! Rizzo!

784
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:25,470
Rizzo... Rizzo.

785
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,350
Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

786
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,606
For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

787
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:41,611
It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

788
00:54:42,695 --> 00:54:46,699
I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

789
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:51,538
Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain... suffering his own demons.

790
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,289
Rizzo was there, too.

791
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,002
I had lost any sense of time.

792
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,044
I thought you'd never wake up.

793
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,714
I thought I'd never want to.

794
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,259
John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

795
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:51,472
How are they?
They're alive.

796
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,267
Who isn't?

797
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,187
Rizzo.

798
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,065
They killed him?

799
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:07,280
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

800
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,620
Rizzo was dead because of us.

801
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,040
We made him think that going
up against the guards...

802
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,541
...in a meaningless football game...

803
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,295
...had some value... that it would
give us a reason to go on.

804
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,173
Once again, we were wrong.

805
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,677
Did they give you
your release date yet?

806
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,179
Nokes had a letter from the warden.

807
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,890
Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up...

808
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,892
When do you figure?

809
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,896
End of spring, early
summer or something.

810
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,524
I wish we were coming with you.

811
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,902
It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

812
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,240
No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

813
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,620
When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

814
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:57,247
Shave a month or two off.

815
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,083
-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

816
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,503
Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

817
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,755
I don't want anybody to know.

818
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,260
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

819
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,762
...not my mother. Nobody.

820
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,932
I don't either.

821
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,268
I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

822
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,646
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

823
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,358
Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

824
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,611
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

825
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,951
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

826
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,496
So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

827
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,832
The truth stays with us.

828
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,837
I want to be able to sleep one night...

829
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,967
...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

830
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,683
If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

831
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,147
Someday, John, I promise.

832
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,334
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

833
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,086
I was given four copies
of my release form.

834
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,756
The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

835
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,801
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

836
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,471
...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

837
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,307
You should be asleep.

838
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:44,604
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

839
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,609
I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

840
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,611
I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

841
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,238
I'm not working those kind of hours.

842
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,781
Yeah, did you put in for it?

843
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,241
I put in for it!

844
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,992
Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

845
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,829
I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

846
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,958
A part of all of us was
left there that night.

847
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,336
That night will never be
removed from my mind.

848
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,466
The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

849
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,136
My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

850
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,477
At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

851
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,565
The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighbourhood knew their names.

852
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,610
They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

853
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,195
They were also its deadliest.

854
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,283
The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

855
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,952
He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

856
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,456
He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

857
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,627
He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

858
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,922
He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

859
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,218
The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

860
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,553
...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

861
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,266
In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

862
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,561
...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

863
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,692
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

864
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,446
-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

865
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,240
It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get...

866
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,616
They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

867
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,953
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

868
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,830
He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

869
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,668
Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

870
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,087
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

871
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,592
Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

872
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,347
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

873
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,017
...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

874
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,435
Sure thing.

875
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,404
The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

876
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,408
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

877
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,159
You get my meaning?

878
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,346
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

879
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,337
Can I help you with something, chief?

880
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:43,593
Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

881
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,643
I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

882
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,814
...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

883
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,941
Is that okay by you?

884
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,405
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

885
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,334
Motherfucker.

886
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,446
That's him.

887
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,156
Are you fucking kidding me?

888
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,410
Bingo!

889
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,270
This is amazing.

890
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,106
Hello... it's been a long time!

891
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,943
Who the fuck are you guys?

892
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,907
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

893
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,494
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

894
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,748
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

895
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,626
You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

896
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,295
...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

897
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,922
That seems like a waste.

898
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,091
I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

899
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,009
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

900
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,600
I can see how he might forget us.

901
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,187
You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

902
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,481
It's a little harder for us to forget.

903
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,109
You gave us so much more to remember.

904
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,864
You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

905
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,618
Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

906
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,006
Yeah, that's right.

907
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,139
That was a long time ago.

908
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,435
So how you been?

909
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,937
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

910
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,565
So, what do you want?

911
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,736
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

912
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,826
You ordered the meat loaf.

913
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,456
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

914
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,583
You fucked up.

915
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:01,726
Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

916
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:07,941
All of you... scared shitless.
But I...

917
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,321
...I tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

918
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,991
I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

919
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,660
...fucking and beating up little boys.

920
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,120
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

921
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,039
You're gonna burn in hell.

922
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,165
Yeah, after you.

923
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,130
Did that hurt, Nokes?

924
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,922
Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

925
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,853
John Reilly, how do you plead?

926
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,396
Not guilty, Your Honour.

927
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,231
Thomas Marcano?

928
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,901
Not guilty, Your Honour.

929
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:37,155
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

930
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,784
In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

931
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,288
...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

932
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,457
...but the relationship
had been altered.

933
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,795
We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

934
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,006
...that would force us to
deal with the past.

935
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,856
One down, Shakes, one down.

936
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:14,692
One what?

937
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:20,281
One Sean Nokes.

938
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:22,325
Nokes?

939
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,876
At the time of Nokes' shooting,

940
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:34,879
Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

941
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,091
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

942
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:39,884
Then, he hung up.

943
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,140
-So, what did they say?
-What?

944
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,642
John and Tommy, what'd they say?

945
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,143
It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

946
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,063
Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

947
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:55,316
-John did.
-Yeah?

948
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,193
What did he say?

949
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,655
He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

950
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,202
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

951
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,872
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

952
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,791
Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

953
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,419
-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

954
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,045
Perfect for what?

955
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,926
Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

956
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,094
-Me?
-Yeah.

957
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:27,098
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

958
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,224
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

959
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,105
Get some coffee?

960
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:36,107
Let's take a walk.

961
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,953
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

962
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,831
What, are you fucking nuts?

963
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:53,708
Just hear me out.

964
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,878
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

965
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,379
I'm not taking this case to win.

966
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,591
I'm taking this case to lose.

967
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:03,843
What does that mean?

968
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,847
It means it's payback time.

969
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:13,394
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

970
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,524
It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but... here it is.

971
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,653
And you and l, we can finish it.

972
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:23,780
Finish what, Mikey?

973
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,992
You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

974
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,913
I don't know... ten years ago.

975
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,416
You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

976
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:40,755
I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

977
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,467
Payback time.

978
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,637
It's our time.

979
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,681
What are you saying, Mike?

980
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,434
I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

981
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,230
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

982
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,441
Let's walk.

983
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,780
So, I asked for the case.

984
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:07,824
I told them I was from the same
neighbourhood as the accused...

985
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:09,993
...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

986
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:11,160
They bought it.

987
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,122
And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

988
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,417
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

989
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,044
We were never at Wilkinson's.

990
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,176
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

991
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:28,469
Bring it all down.

992
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:32,473
Adam Styler, plain-clothes cop,
works narcotics in Queens.

993
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,269
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

994
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,104
Other personal information there.

995
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:41,774
Henry Addison now works for the Mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

996
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,985
He's a Community Outreach
Director in Brooklyn.

997
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,281
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

998
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,701
Ralph Ferguson works in a Social
Service agency in Long Island.

999
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,369
How long have you been
working on this, Mike?

1000
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,663
He's recently divorced, got
one child, and on weekends...

1001
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,498
...teaches Catholic Sunday school.

1002
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,292
Well, he seems clean then, right?

1003
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:01,377
That's exactly why I
want the piece of shit.

1004
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,797
The plan is to call Ferguson
in as a character witness.

1005
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,133
Get him talking about his
best friend, Sean Nokes.

1006
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:11,304
Once I got him on the stand, I'm
gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

1007
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:16,392
Mike, are you sure you
want to go this way?

1008
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,814
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

1009
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,818
Do you still sleep with the light on?

1010
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,619
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

1011
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,621
No, it'll play better in
court if they don't know.

1012
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,804
The 'not guilty' verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question.

1013
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:56,099
Danny Snyder was to remain as
Tommy and John's attorney.

1014
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,561
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen...

1015
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,563
...to deliver information and keep quiet.

1016
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,107
Both were skills the Neighbourhood
had in abundance.

1017
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,943
We'd set up a simple
method of communication.

1018
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,946
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work...

1019
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,282
...for me to call my non-existent
girlfriend, "Gloria".

1020
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:16,327
If I needed to get word to Michael, I'd
have someone from the neighbourhood...

1021
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,162
...pick up an early edition
of the New York Times...

1022
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,499
...write the word "Edmund" in the upper
right hand corner of the Metro section...

1023
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,501
...and drop it in front
of Michael's apartment.

1024
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:29,674
For this plan to succeed...

1025
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,760
...we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted.

1026
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,388
The plan depended on
keeping Michael alive...

1027
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,974
...which meant that word had to get
to John and Tommy's killing crew...

1028
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:39,350
...that he was not an open target.

1029
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,229
After this night, Michael would
not be available to any of us.

1030
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,648
The only time we would see
him would be in court.

1031
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,859
-That's it?
-Not quite.

1032
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:51,863
We've got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify.

1033
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:52,989
Gotta get that number down.

1034
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,533
-I'll talk to King Benny.
-Good.

1035
01:14:56,701 --> 01:15:00,205
I can handle two, but...
you gotta get us one for our side.

1036
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,665
-One of what?
-One witness.

1037
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:06,169
A witness who'll put John & Tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder.

1038
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,546
A witness they can't touch.

1039
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:11,508
Don't they have a name for that?

1040
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,801
A judge would call it perjury.

1041
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:16,679
And what are we calling it?

1042
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,181
A favour.

1043
01:15:21,511 --> 01:15:22,179
Get up!

1044
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:27,392
-Tony!
-Yeah, King?

1045
01:15:27,809 --> 01:15:29,603
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

1046
01:15:30,187 --> 01:15:31,521
Who? Danny Snyder, the lawyer?

1047
01:15:31,688 --> 01:15:33,357
You know more than one Danny Snyder?

1048
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:36,068
Bring me the one you know.

1049
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:59,424
I can't do this now, you gotta know that.
It's been a long time for me.

1050
01:16:01,927 --> 01:16:05,264
You need somebody younger, you know.
Somebody like I used to be.

1051
01:16:05,806 --> 01:16:06,974
Younger is not better.

1052
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:11,270
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

1053
01:16:11,478 --> 01:16:13,313
Yeah, I'm lucky I can
find the courthouse.

1054
01:16:15,107 --> 01:16:18,610
I had only four cases last year.
You know how many I won?

1055
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:22,155
None. That's how many. None.

1056
01:16:23,448 --> 01:16:26,535
In two of them, I think the...

1057
01:16:26,785 --> 01:16:28,370
...the jury blamed me personally.

1058
01:16:28,954 --> 01:16:29,955
They must've been innocent.

1059
01:16:31,456 --> 01:16:34,376
It's tough to get
innocent men off a rap.

1060
01:16:34,793 --> 01:16:37,004
I wasn't even planning on
going to court with this one.

1061
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:40,132
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could and walk away.

1062
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:43,051
I wasn't planning on
taking this to trial, sir.

1063
01:16:43,385 --> 01:16:45,387
Well, your plans have been changed.

1064
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:49,766
Well, I am afraid that I'll make a
mistake and say the wrong thing...

1065
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:55,063
...make a wrong turn somewhere.
And you don't want to take that risk.

1066
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:56,732
Life is risk.

1067
01:16:57,024 --> 01:16:57,900
I'm sorry.

1068
01:16:58,233 --> 01:16:59,568
Life is risk.

1069
01:17:00,152 --> 01:17:01,153
Life is a risk?

1070
01:17:05,824 --> 01:17:07,326
I haven't been in here before.

1071
01:17:09,536 --> 01:17:10,871
What do you need me to do?

1072
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:15,375
You're gonna be given the
answers and the questions.

1073
01:17:16,543 --> 01:17:20,005
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1074
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:22,549
Is it in English?

1075
01:17:22,716 --> 01:17:25,636
Just don't drift, don't drink,
and don't lose.

1076
01:17:27,262 --> 01:17:28,388
What if I do lose?

1077
01:17:28,764 --> 01:17:30,891
Then you'll go down for the dirt nap.

1078
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,894
Never heard that expression before.

1079
01:17:36,271 --> 01:17:36,939
Dirt nap.

1080
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:43,278
I'm not really cut out for this anymore.
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus...

1081
01:17:43,987 --> 01:17:46,615
...and sues, I like that.

1082
01:17:46,782 --> 01:17:50,577
Some lady slips in a supermarket...
I'm with her.

1083
01:17:50,744 --> 01:17:52,246
The discussion is over.

1084
01:17:52,538 --> 01:17:56,333
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

1085
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,668
It was once.

1086
01:17:58,752 --> 01:18:00,337
Before you let the drink lead.

1087
01:18:01,838 --> 01:18:05,676
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1088
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:08,887
You've got nothing to lose...
just like the rest of us.

1089
01:18:09,805 --> 01:18:12,683
I don't want to be a burden
to you, but I...

1090
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:17,896
...along with my alcohol problem,
I have a slight drug problem.

1091
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:19,064
I mean, nothing big.

1092
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,649
Go away.

1093
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:33,328
Within days of Michael taking the case...

1094
01:18:33,412 --> 01:18:35,581
...the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.

1095
01:18:36,206 --> 01:18:39,418
The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

1096
01:18:39,877 --> 01:18:43,213
"Traitor" and "gutter rat" were
heard up and down the avenue.

1097
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,549
But there was never to be
a death move against him.

1098
01:18:46,174 --> 01:18:50,012
The hit on Michael Sullivan, if there was
one, could only come from King Benny.

1099
01:18:50,429 --> 01:18:52,890
The underground word...
the only one that mattered...

1100
01:18:53,098 --> 01:18:55,434
...had spread through the streets with
the speed of a late-night bullet.

1101
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,441
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

1102
01:19:03,442 --> 01:19:07,404
"Sleepers" was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.

1103
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:19,708
You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

1104
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:23,128
Need your help, fat man.
Need a big favour.

1105
01:19:23,212 --> 01:19:24,338
I'll be outside.

1106
01:19:24,796 --> 01:19:25,839
King Benny been to see you?

1107
01:19:26,048 --> 01:19:27,174
Oh, my goodness!

1108
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:29,885
What a fucking thing we put together!

1109
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:34,514
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1110
01:19:34,848 --> 01:19:37,351
Fucking paper boy,
making like Dick Tracy.

1111
01:19:38,352 --> 01:19:41,021
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing!

1112
01:19:42,314 --> 01:19:45,108
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1113
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:47,861
Fucking General Custer has
a better shot at a walk!

1114
01:19:48,028 --> 01:19:49,780
There's no connection
with the guard and us.

1115
01:19:49,947 --> 01:19:51,823
The cops think it's a
drug-related homicide.

1116
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,825
It's just we need you to
pull a few strings, fat man.

1117
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,162
You know, if you get caught on this,
you're looking straight at serious.

1118
01:19:57,663 --> 01:19:59,498
I'm talking real jail.
The big house...

1119
01:20:07,047 --> 01:20:08,799
They are not good boys any more.

1120
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:12,970
They're killers now.
Cold as stone.

1121
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,764
I know.

1122
01:20:16,431 --> 01:20:19,268
I know what they were, and I know
what they are, and it's not about that.

1123
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:23,063
It's not worth it, throwing
away life just to get even.

1124
01:20:24,523 --> 01:20:26,525
You and the lawyer have
a chance to get out.

1125
01:20:26,817 --> 01:20:27,859
To get out the right way.

1126
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,529
There's no choice... not for us.

1127
01:20:34,992 --> 01:20:36,702
On occasion, I'd have
dinner with Carol.

1128
01:20:37,244 --> 01:20:40,581
She still lived in the neighbourhood and
was a social worker in the South Bronx.

1129
01:20:41,123 --> 01:20:43,792
Her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years.

1130
01:20:44,877 --> 01:20:47,921
Whenever we went out as a group, Carol
would walk between Michael and John...

1131
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,339
...grasping their arms...

1132
01:20:50,716 --> 01:20:52,885
...in step between the lawyer
and the killer.

1133
01:20:52,968 --> 01:20:56,597
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1134
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:59,558
Would you settle for a
couple of beers, Carol?

1135
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:03,228
If that's your best offer.

1136
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:06,231
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1137
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:08,442
Deal.

1138
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:15,490
You look tired.

1139
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:17,034
Thank you.

1140
01:21:18,076 --> 01:21:20,078
They don't give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours?

1141
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:26,126
So, how much do you know?

1142
01:21:27,502 --> 01:21:28,795
Just what the neighbourhood says.

1143
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:31,673
And what I read in papers like yours.

1144
01:21:32,674 --> 01:21:34,009
What does the neighbourhood say?

1145
01:21:34,551 --> 01:21:36,136
That they're gonna put
Johnny and Tommy away.

1146
01:21:36,553 --> 01:21:38,472
That their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

1147
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,640
You believe that?

1148
01:21:40,057 --> 01:21:41,391
It's hard not to, Shakes.

1149
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:45,270
Unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1150
01:21:46,605 --> 01:21:48,607
-He did take the case.
-What else is there to say?

1151
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:52,736
You know Michael very well...

1152
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:55,447
...maybe even better than I do.

1153
01:21:55,697 --> 01:21:58,283
Yeah, I thought I did.
Now, I don't know.

1154
01:21:58,492 --> 01:22:00,160
-You do know.
-I don't know!

1155
01:22:01,036 --> 01:22:02,621
He went in there, and
he asked for the case.

1156
01:22:02,829 --> 01:22:04,915
Now, you tell me, what the
hell kind of friend is that?

1157
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:06,875
The best kind.

1158
01:22:08,293 --> 01:22:10,337
The kind who'll throw away
everything to help his friends.

1159
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:15,676
What are you telling me, Shakes?

1160
01:22:17,553 --> 01:22:21,014
You know this neighbourhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1161
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:23,016
Why should this be any different?

1162
01:22:29,606 --> 01:22:30,566
I'm hungry.

1163
01:22:31,817 --> 01:22:33,110
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1164
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:38,532
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1165
01:22:39,157 --> 01:22:41,618
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1166
01:22:42,619 --> 01:22:45,289
And he just... he shut down.

1167
01:22:45,831 --> 01:22:49,418
Couldn't touch him...
couldn't even breathe on him.

1168
01:22:52,546 --> 01:22:53,463
I thought it was me.

1169
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,759
After a while, it just
gets easier to let it go.

1170
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:00,053
Do you still love him?

1171
01:23:00,512 --> 01:23:01,680
I don't think about it, Shakes.

1172
01:23:03,557 --> 01:23:05,684
If I did, I'd say 'yes.'

1173
01:23:06,685 --> 01:23:07,561
But you're with John now.

1174
01:23:08,312 --> 01:23:12,482
Yeah... as much as
anybody can be with John.

1175
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:16,570
The man I know is not
the boy you remember.

1176
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:17,946
None of us are.

1177
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:20,949
But there's something
special about John.

1178
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:24,953
You just have to look a
little harder to see it.

1179
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:31,793
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1180
01:23:32,336 --> 01:23:34,171
-Me?
-Yeah.

1181
01:23:35,714 --> 01:23:36,840
Cause you were Mikey's girl.

1182
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:40,636
He got to you first.

1183
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:42,262
And after Mikey?

1184
01:23:43,263 --> 01:23:44,264
I think it was Tommy's turn.

1185
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,558
Fuck you!

1186
01:23:49,853 --> 01:23:50,896
Because...

1187
01:23:52,272 --> 01:23:54,107
...I didn't think you'd say 'yes.'

1188
01:24:00,656 --> 01:24:02,324
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1189
01:24:03,992 --> 01:24:04,952
You were wrong.

1190
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:13,502
What? Go ahead and say it.

1191
01:24:15,879 --> 01:24:19,299
You work at Social Services, you
got files. You got access to files.

1192
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,177
And from time to time, we're
gonna need some information.

1193
01:24:22,344 --> 01:24:23,428
Yeah, sure... whatever...

1194
01:24:24,638 --> 01:24:25,973
Wait. What?

1195
01:24:26,348 --> 01:24:28,308
Well, what do you want?
You want information?

1196
01:24:28,725 --> 01:24:30,519
You want me to get the files?
I'll get the files!

1197
01:24:31,395 --> 01:24:32,187
What do you want?

1198
01:24:38,569 --> 01:24:39,695
You still visit John?

1199
01:24:40,529 --> 01:24:42,406
Yeah, once a week for about an hour.

1200
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:44,616
-Good.
-Good?

1201
01:24:44,866 --> 01:24:47,536
Yeah, good. Just don't tell
him that you've seen me.

1202
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,371
Just don't tell him anything.

1203
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:52,040
I mean, the more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

1204
01:24:53,959 --> 01:24:55,419
Shakes, what is this about?

1205
01:24:58,297 --> 01:25:00,966
You want a Rolls Royce?
You don't come here.

1206
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,760
You go to England or wherever
the fuck they make it.

1207
01:25:04,386 --> 01:25:06,430
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1208
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,432
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1209
01:25:08,807 --> 01:25:12,603
But if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere, or...

1210
01:25:12,936 --> 01:25:16,607
...some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about, there's only one place to go.

1211
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:21,278
Right here, Hell's Kitchen!
It is the lost and found of shit!

1212
01:25:21,904 --> 01:25:25,157
They lose it and we find it!
Forget about it, man.

1213
01:25:26,658 --> 01:25:30,120
Now, you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1214
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:32,831
Two others changed their minds.

1215
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:36,126
-Which two?
-The suits at the bar.

1216
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:40,088
So that still leaves the
couple in the booth?

1217
01:25:40,172 --> 01:25:41,590
For now.

1218
01:25:43,008 --> 01:25:44,801
Everything else falling into place?

1219
01:25:46,303 --> 01:25:50,182
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1220
01:25:51,183 --> 01:25:51,850
I know.

1221
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:58,482
When you were sent away,

1222
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:02,319
I was always sorry I
couldn't do more for you.

1223
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:13,080
I didn't know you liked
pigeons so much.

1224
01:26:13,413 --> 01:26:15,499
I like anything that don't talk.

1225
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:20,337
Michael's vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear.

1226
01:26:20,879 --> 01:26:22,047
He was aiming for guilty...

1227
01:26:22,297 --> 01:26:24,967
...a charge of guilty against
the Wilkinson Home for Boys...

1228
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:28,637
...against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison, and Ralph Ferguson.

1229
01:26:28,929 --> 01:26:32,432
I will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that.

1230
01:26:33,183 --> 01:26:35,185
I will place them at
the scene of the crime.

1231
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:37,354
I will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm...

1232
01:26:37,604 --> 01:26:39,856
...that they were there
on that deadly night.

1233
01:26:40,774 --> 01:26:44,736
I will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room...

1234
01:26:44,903 --> 01:26:48,323
...and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

1235
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:50,450
I'm sure you all know what that means...

1236
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:52,911
...since you probably watch
as much television as I do.

1237
01:26:55,956 --> 01:26:59,751
John... John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1238
01:26:59,918 --> 01:27:03,255
...are two innocent pawns,
quickly arrested and just...

1239
01:27:05,257 --> 01:27:06,758
...as quickly prosecuted on the...

1240
01:27:07,301 --> 01:27:09,136
...slightest threads of evidence.

1241
01:27:09,428 --> 01:27:12,097
Look on the bright side, he
seems to know their names.

1242
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,099
I don't have to tell you. You and I
know how these things work.

1243
01:27:23,984 --> 01:27:25,319
It's nice when you come around.

1244
01:27:28,864 --> 01:27:30,532
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty!

1245
01:27:31,575 --> 01:27:32,409
Take it.

1246
01:27:32,492 --> 01:27:33,827
No, no, she'll do it.

1247
01:27:43,253 --> 01:27:44,004
How's work?

1248
01:27:46,757 --> 01:27:47,716
I'm still there.

1249
01:27:52,346 --> 01:27:53,347
You know, Pop, I...

1250
01:27:55,432 --> 01:27:56,475
...I went down to the courthouse.

1251
01:27:58,352 --> 01:27:59,770
You know, I saw John and Tommy.

1252
01:28:00,812 --> 01:28:02,898
I started thinking back
to when we were young...

1253
01:28:02,981 --> 01:28:03,899
Where's the chicken?

1254
01:28:08,487 --> 01:28:09,154
So?

1255
01:28:10,906 --> 01:28:13,909
Nothing. I was just thinking.

1256
01:28:15,744 --> 01:28:17,162
You're doing good, right?

1257
01:28:19,248 --> 01:28:20,415
Yeah. Doing good.

1258
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:21,708
Good.

1259
01:29:04,126 --> 01:29:05,627
What the hell do these things do?

1260
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:07,296
They're for praying.

1261
01:29:08,046 --> 01:29:08,797
Look at all this shit!

1262
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:11,383
What, does your mother think you're
in the fucking army or something?

1263
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,343
Ain't none of it on the approved list.

1264
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,137
I'm sure your Mommy
got a copy of that list.

1265
01:29:15,345 --> 01:29:16,847
My mother can't speak English that well.

1266
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:20,183
Don't blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid, all right?

1267
01:29:25,522 --> 01:29:26,690
When are you gonna let us hear you pray?

1268
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:39,828
Maybe he needs something to pray for.

1269
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:41,830
Put your hands on the table
and lay them flat.

1270
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:45,000
Spread your legs.

1271
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,712
Now start thinking up some prayers.

1272
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:59,306
We don't hear no praying.

1273
01:29:59,556 --> 01:30:02,226
You better start, or Styler might
lose his baton up your ass.

1274
01:30:02,601 --> 01:30:04,061
Blessed art thou among women...

1275
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:05,938
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

1276
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:07,314
Pray nice and loud!

1277
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:12,736
Fucker, pray! Come on, now!

1278
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:17,741
-Louder.
-Hail Mary...

1279
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,160
Louder, fucker!

1280
01:30:22,412 --> 01:30:23,956
Pray like you're in fucking church!

1281
01:30:35,133 --> 01:30:37,094
Sorry I'm late.
I lost all track of time.

1282
01:30:37,594 --> 01:30:40,264
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

1283
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,432
But I want you to come along.
So, you want to just go...

1284
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:46,520
-Where are we going?
-To his place.

1285
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,480
-Where is it?
-It's in the rectory.

1286
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:50,023
No. Shakes!

1287
01:30:50,524 --> 01:30:52,943
-Just trust me.
-I can't.

1288
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:00,617
How was court today?

1289
01:31:01,869 --> 01:31:06,123
Like the first round of a fight...
everybody just feeling each other out.

1290
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:08,876
How did the boys look?

1291
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:11,211
Like they wished they
were someplace else.

1292
01:31:13,547 --> 01:31:15,841
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

1293
01:31:18,385 --> 01:31:19,720
It's not too late, Father.

1294
01:31:22,556 --> 01:31:24,975
We still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep...

1295
01:31:26,351 --> 01:31:27,227
...one more chance.

1296
01:31:30,188 --> 01:31:31,315
Is that chance legal?

1297
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:34,943
Last chances never are.

1298
01:31:36,028 --> 01:31:36,945
King Benny behind this?

1299
01:31:38,572 --> 01:31:41,366
He's in on it, but...
he's not calling the shots.

1300
01:31:41,742 --> 01:31:42,367
Who is?

1301
01:31:44,411 --> 01:31:45,078
Michael.

1302
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,332
I should've smelled it.

1303
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,710
The minute he went for the case,
I should've figured something was up.

1304
01:31:52,252 --> 01:31:53,462
It's a good plan.

1305
01:31:53,962 --> 01:31:57,090
Michael's got it all covered...
just about every base you look at.

1306
01:31:57,925 --> 01:31:58,926
He's got it covered.

1307
01:31:59,176 --> 01:32:00,135
Not every base.

1308
01:32:01,428 --> 01:32:03,263
You're short something, or else
you wouldn't be here.

1309
01:32:04,097 --> 01:32:05,766
You don't shit a shitter, right?

1310
01:32:05,974 --> 01:32:06,934
That's right.

1311
01:32:09,645 --> 01:32:10,354
So, what is it?

1312
01:32:10,437 --> 01:32:11,772
Where do you come up short?

1313
01:32:14,358 --> 01:32:15,192
Witness.

1314
01:32:16,944 --> 01:32:18,654
We need somebody
to take the stand and say...

1315
01:32:18,737 --> 01:32:21,073
...they were with John and
Tommy on the night of the murder.

1316
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,158
So, you figured if you had a
priest, it would be perfect?

1317
01:32:24,409 --> 01:32:25,911
Not just any priest.

1318
01:32:42,135 --> 01:32:46,807
You're asking me...
you're asking me to lie.

1319
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:51,019
You're asking me to swear
to God and then lie.

1320
01:32:52,312 --> 01:32:54,273
I'm asking you to save two of your boys.

1321
01:32:59,903 --> 01:33:03,240
-Did they kill that guard?
-Yes.

1322
01:33:04,408 --> 01:33:08,328
So what they said is true?
They walked in and they killed him?

1323
01:33:09,329 --> 01:33:09,955
Yes.

1324
01:33:11,582 --> 01:33:14,001
They killed him exactly like that.

1325
01:33:18,255 --> 01:33:19,256
I think I need a drink.

1326
01:33:21,884 --> 01:33:22,885
Anyone want a drink?

1327
01:33:41,486 --> 01:33:43,155
This is some favour you're asking me.

1328
01:33:44,781 --> 01:33:45,657
We know that.

1329
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:48,327
No, I don't think you do know.

1330
01:33:50,204 --> 01:33:52,289
You said, if there was ever
anything really important...

1331
01:33:52,372 --> 01:33:54,082
...I could come to you, ask you.

1332
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:57,961
I was thinking more along
the lines of Yankee tickets.

1333
01:34:00,422 --> 01:34:04,885
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

1334
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:09,681
What about the life that was taken,
Shakes? What's that worth?

1335
01:34:10,307 --> 01:34:12,684
To me? Nothing.

1336
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:17,981
Why not?
Tell me.

1337
01:34:27,324 --> 01:34:29,034
He was a guard at Wilkinsons.

1338
01:34:32,788 --> 01:34:33,580
All right.

1339
01:34:34,122 --> 01:34:37,501
If Father Bobby was gonna be involved, he
deserved to know what he's getting into.

1340
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,380
If he wasn't, I trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room.

1341
01:34:43,006 --> 01:34:44,841
I thought that Carol
needed to know, as well.

1342
01:34:45,676 --> 01:34:48,512
Jesus Christ, we were just boys.
We were not tough.

1343
01:34:52,432 --> 01:34:53,642
They held us down.

1344
01:34:57,563 --> 01:35:01,233
I told him about the torture,
the beatings, and the rapes.

1345
01:35:01,692 --> 01:35:04,069
I told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed...

1346
01:35:04,236 --> 01:35:06,572
...to Father Bobby's God
for help that never came.

1347
01:35:07,364 --> 01:35:08,699
I told them everything.

1348
01:35:08,907 --> 01:35:11,785
We can't fight anymore.
They just took it all.

1349
01:35:13,245 --> 01:35:17,541
John used to wail at night, hear
it all the way down the hall.

1350
01:35:20,586 --> 01:35:23,046
You know he wanted to be a priest,
John wanted to be a priest.

1351
01:35:27,801 --> 01:35:31,430
Then he pulls his pants down.
I didn't even know what a blow job was.

1352
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:38,645
I just blacked out what I could.
It was like I couldn't even breathe.

1353
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:42,900
Then... I started to choke.

1354
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:45,402
He was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head.

1355
01:35:48,322 --> 01:35:49,406
Then I blacked out.

1356
01:35:52,075 --> 01:35:56,455
But I do remember when, for fun,
they'd take us down in the basement...

1357
01:35:57,664 --> 01:35:59,791
...tie two or three of us together...

1358
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:03,545
...and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked'em.

1359
01:36:19,019 --> 01:36:20,562
I got a decision to make.

1360
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:27,319
I only pray it's the right one.

1361
01:36:29,196 --> 01:36:32,741
It will be, Father...
whichever way you go.

1362
01:36:38,705 --> 01:36:39,665
Good night.

1363
01:36:48,507 --> 01:36:50,926
So, you were sitting down,
you were having dinner...

1364
01:36:52,261 --> 01:36:53,929
...and two men entered
McHale's, correct?

1365
01:36:54,846 --> 01:36:58,100
Did you see them as they approached
the table where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

1366
01:36:58,308 --> 01:36:59,643
I noticed it, yes.

1367
01:37:00,143 --> 01:37:01,645
Did you hear what
was said between them?

1368
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,607
-Did you see them pull out their guns?
-No.

1369
01:37:05,857 --> 01:37:09,486
-Did you hear the shots?
-Yes, I heard the shots.

1370
01:37:09,695 --> 01:37:13,824
And what did they do? What was
their behaviour after the shooting?

1371
01:37:14,908 --> 01:37:17,578
They walked out of McHale's
as if nothing had happened.

1372
01:37:18,203 --> 01:37:22,666
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

1373
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:26,795
Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1374
01:37:27,254 --> 01:37:30,215
-Are you positive?
-Yes, very positive.

1375
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:33,552
Are the two men you saw at
McHale's in this room today?

1376
01:37:33,594 --> 01:37:34,553
Yes, they are.

1377
01:37:35,012 --> 01:37:36,555
Could you point them
out to the jury, please?

1378
01:37:37,931 --> 01:37:39,099
They're sitting right over there.

1379
01:37:40,475 --> 01:37:44,229
Your Honour, will the record reflect that
Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants...

1380
01:37:44,396 --> 01:37:47,441
...John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
as the two men in question.

1381
01:37:47,733 --> 01:37:48,567
Noted.

1382
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:50,444
Thank you. No further questions.

1383
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:53,947
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1384
01:37:54,281 --> 01:37:55,616
Yes, Your Honour, we are.

1385
01:37:56,074 --> 01:37:56,950
Good morning.

1386
01:37:57,034 --> 01:38:00,662
I just have a few questions. I won't
take too much of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

1387
01:38:01,872 --> 01:38:06,251
You stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner. Is that correct?

1388
01:38:06,752 --> 01:38:10,923
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1389
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,759
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1390
01:38:14,134 --> 01:38:16,595
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1391
01:38:17,387 --> 01:38:18,680
What do you mean "prior"?

1392
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:22,893
At lunch... maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch?

1393
01:38:23,477 --> 01:38:24,269
Yes, I did.

1394
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,605
What did you have to drink?

1395
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:30,651
I went shopping, and I stopped
at a place on Madison Avenue...

1396
01:38:30,817 --> 01:38:32,444
-...for some lunch.
-See, I didn't ask you where you went.

1397
01:38:32,611 --> 01:38:34,321
I asked you what you
had to drink at lunch?

1398
01:38:35,489 --> 01:38:37,783
-A martini.
-And what else?

1399
01:38:40,786 --> 01:38:42,120
Probably some wine.

1400
01:38:43,038 --> 01:38:47,209
Yes, and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink?

1401
01:38:49,628 --> 01:38:51,463
One glass, maybe two.

1402
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:55,050
-Closer to two?
-Yes, probably two glasses.

1403
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:02,558
It's like pulling teeth.

1404
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:07,563
I should've pinned the
questions to his shirt.

1405
01:39:09,815 --> 01:39:12,776
And tell me, then at dinner you...

1406
01:39:12,859 --> 01:39:13,860
Strike that.

1407
01:39:22,202 --> 01:39:24,663
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1408
01:39:24,872 --> 01:39:25,831
Objection, Your Honour!

1409
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,418
What Mrs. Salinas did on the
day of the murder...

1410
01:39:29,585 --> 01:39:31,879
...has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder.

1411
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,714
How much she had to
drink does, Your Honour.

1412
01:39:34,047 --> 01:39:34,882
Overruled!

1413
01:39:36,884 --> 01:39:40,387
Mrs. Salinas, what time
did you have lunch?

1414
01:39:40,721 --> 01:39:42,055
About one-thirty.

1415
01:39:42,264 --> 01:39:43,432
And what did you have for lunch?

1416
01:39:43,932 --> 01:39:47,019
It was a while ago.
Probably a salad.

1417
01:39:47,144 --> 01:39:49,146
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1418
01:39:49,313 --> 01:39:52,399
A martini, two glasses of wine
and a salad, is that correct?

1419
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:54,026
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:39:54,318 --> 01:39:58,989
And then you had wine at dinner,
about 6 hours later, is that correct?

1421
01:39:59,323 --> 01:40:00,240
Yes, that's right.

1422
01:40:00,866 --> 01:40:02,034
How much wine did you have to drink...

1423
01:40:02,117 --> 01:40:04,620
...by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHale's?

1424
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:08,916
-Two glasses.
-Would you say that four glasses of wine...

1425
01:40:09,082 --> 01:40:13,086
...and a martini within a 6-hour
period is a lot for you to drink?

1426
01:40:13,754 --> 01:40:15,005
Yes, it is.

1427
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:25,474
Have you ever heard a gun fired,
prior to the night in question?

1428
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:30,270
How would you describe the sound?

1429
01:40:30,812 --> 01:40:33,482
It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1430
01:40:34,816 --> 01:40:38,820
-Did the sound frighten you?
-Very much.

1431
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:41,657
Did you close your eyes?

1432
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:46,370
At first... until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1433
01:40:46,662 --> 01:40:50,666
Did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHale's?

1434
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:54,753
Well, I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been shot.

1435
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:59,508
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1436
01:41:00,717 --> 01:41:02,052
Yes, I did.

1437
01:41:02,219 --> 01:41:06,390
Yet, despite that fear, despite
that risk to your life...

1438
01:41:06,598 --> 01:41:10,727
...you looked at their
faces as they left?

1439
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:13,438
-Yes, I did.
-Is that correct?

1440
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:15,857
Yes, I did.

1441
01:41:16,775 --> 01:41:18,944
Did you look at their faces?
Did you really...

1442
01:41:19,611 --> 01:41:22,948
...really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1443
01:41:23,365 --> 01:41:26,702
I glanced at them when they
walked by, but I did see them!

1444
01:41:27,077 --> 01:41:30,873
You... glanced?
You didn't look?

1445
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,125
I saw them!

1446
01:41:34,334 --> 01:41:38,589
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.
You glanced at them through the eyes...

1447
01:41:38,922 --> 01:41:43,594
...of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink.

1448
01:41:44,595 --> 01:41:47,222
-Objection, Your Honour.
-There is no need, Your Honour.

1449
01:41:47,347 --> 01:41:48,724
I have no further questions.

1450
01:41:48,932 --> 01:41:51,351
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1451
01:41:55,272 --> 01:41:57,107
It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

1452
01:41:57,316 --> 01:42:00,694
Frank Magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

1453
01:42:00,986 --> 01:42:03,989
He was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation.

1454
01:42:04,656 --> 01:42:06,199
He was also King Benny's nephew.

1455
01:42:07,117 --> 01:42:09,161
Nick Davenport
was with Internal Affairs.

1456
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:12,789
He was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty.

1457
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:15,459
He knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a...

1458
01:42:15,626 --> 01:42:18,378
...maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time.

1459
01:42:19,046 --> 01:42:20,380
Frank, what is this shit?

1460
01:42:20,881 --> 01:42:22,591
If I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1461
01:42:23,342 --> 01:42:24,092
You make this one...

1462
01:42:24,176 --> 01:42:26,303
...you're gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the Commissioner.

1463
01:42:26,553 --> 01:42:29,973
You know, you got a real hard-on for this
Styler guy. What's your beef with him?

1464
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:32,309
-One more thing.
-I can't wait.

1465
01:42:32,476 --> 01:42:37,147
It's simple. No one knows who fed you
this information. And I mean, nobody.

1466
01:42:37,481 --> 01:42:38,357
How did you get it?

1467
01:42:38,523 --> 01:42:41,860
It fell into my lap... just like
it's gonna fall into yours.

1468
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:50,494
Christ Almighty!

1469
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,586
You got everything in
here but a confession.

1470
01:42:59,753 --> 01:43:01,338
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1471
01:43:01,713 --> 01:43:03,382
My preference is that
you beat it out of him.

1472
01:43:03,549 --> 01:43:05,050
There's even surveillance photos.

1473
01:43:05,926 --> 01:43:08,971
This piece of shit's pulling in about
five grand a month, ripping off pushers.

1474
01:43:09,054 --> 01:43:10,472
Has been for about 3 years.

1475
01:43:10,764 --> 01:43:12,683
-More like 4.
-He ain't gonna see 5.

1476
01:43:12,808 --> 01:43:14,184
So, you got enough for conviction?

1477
01:43:14,268 --> 01:43:16,395
That ain't up to me.
That's up to a jury.

1478
01:43:20,065 --> 01:43:21,400
Show the jury this.

1479
01:43:24,486 --> 01:43:25,487
What do you got there, Ness?

1480
01:43:25,904 --> 01:43:28,282
About 3 weeks ago,
the body of a drug dealer...

1481
01:43:28,448 --> 01:43:31,660
...named Indian Red Lopez was found
in an alley in Jackson Heights.

1482
01:43:32,244 --> 01:43:34,079
Three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

1483
01:43:34,162 --> 01:43:35,080
I'm with you so far.

1484
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:38,000
This is the gun that killed him,
and these are the shells.

1485
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:41,587
What's behind door number 3?

1486
01:43:42,296 --> 01:43:44,464
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

1487
01:43:48,802 --> 01:43:50,804
-Hey, do me a favour, would you?
-What's that?

1488
01:43:50,971 --> 01:43:52,973
If I ever make it onto your
shit list, give me a call.

1489
01:43:54,057 --> 01:43:55,767
Give me a chance to apologise.

1490
01:43:56,685 --> 01:44:00,397
So, you need anything else, you talk to
Frank. He knows how to get a hold of me.

1491
01:44:00,772 --> 01:44:03,901
Take care of yourself, kid.
Water gets choppy out your way.

1492
01:44:04,318 --> 01:44:05,360
I'll do what I can.

1493
01:44:07,154 --> 01:44:10,490
Hey, Ness... did you ever
think of becoming a cop?

1494
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:12,784
And leave the good guys?

1495
01:44:30,886 --> 01:44:32,221
The body of Christ.

1496
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,788
The body of Christ.

1497
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:03,544
Michael had done all
that could be expected...

1498
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:06,547
...of an Assistant District Attorney
seeking a conviction.

1499
01:45:07,297 --> 01:45:11,552
He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.

1500
01:45:12,052 --> 01:45:14,471
He just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence.

1501
01:45:14,638 --> 01:45:16,890
And he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.

1502
01:45:18,767 --> 01:45:21,103
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working...

1503
01:45:21,186 --> 01:45:23,647
...and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him.

1504
01:45:24,064 --> 01:45:25,190
Did you see their faces?

1505
01:45:25,649 --> 01:45:28,443
Yes, I looked at them,
and they looked at me.

1506
01:45:28,569 --> 01:45:29,653
Did they say anything to you?

1507
01:45:29,903 --> 01:45:32,531
No, they just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

1508
01:45:32,698 --> 01:45:34,866
Are you sure the two
defendants killed Sean Nokes?

1509
01:45:35,033 --> 01:45:36,159
I know they killed him.

1510
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:39,162
If the plan worked, it would
be everyone's success.

1511
01:45:39,872 --> 01:45:41,874
If it failed, the fault
would fall to Michael.

1512
01:45:45,377 --> 01:45:49,381
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the West Side...

1513
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:53,176
...remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder.

1514
01:45:54,136 --> 01:45:57,472
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1515
01:45:57,723 --> 01:45:59,308
Why didn't you turn around, Mr. Carson?

1516
01:45:59,558 --> 01:46:02,394
I was concerned for my
companion's safety.

1517
01:46:02,561 --> 01:46:04,396
Mr. Carson, did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?

1518
01:46:05,564 --> 01:46:08,525
Did they threaten anyone
in McHale's Restaurant?

1519
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,695
I didn't see it, but I know it!

1520
01:46:12,237 --> 01:46:14,531
If you didn't see the defendant
shoot the guard...

1521
01:46:14,615 --> 01:46:16,867
...then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him?

1522
01:46:40,682 --> 01:46:41,850
So, what's the emergency?

1523
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,273
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
It's too risky.

1524
01:46:48,482 --> 01:46:51,818
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

1525
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,696
Why?

1526
01:46:56,406 --> 01:46:58,700
Shakes met with Father Bobby
2 weeks ago.

1527
01:46:59,368 --> 01:47:02,371
-He hasn't heard from him since.
-It's not an overnight decision for him.

1528
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:09,670
-What if he doesn't testify?
-Then we got a very serious problem.

1529
01:47:25,769 --> 01:47:27,771
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1530
01:47:29,523 --> 01:47:32,734
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1531
01:47:33,652 --> 01:47:34,778
He already has.

1532
01:47:36,363 --> 01:47:37,239
What!?

1533
01:47:38,574 --> 01:47:42,202
I... was with him when he
talked to Father Bobby.

1534
01:47:45,414 --> 01:47:46,957
I heard everything, Michael.

1535
01:47:57,175 --> 01:47:58,260
So, you know.

1536
01:48:06,518 --> 01:48:07,936
If only you told me.

1537
01:48:13,025 --> 01:48:14,818
I think things could've been different.

1538
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:18,906
If you could've talked.

1539
01:48:24,119 --> 01:48:26,121
Maybe... maybe we...

1540
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:31,293
Maybe...

1541
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:59,279
Carmen, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1542
01:49:01,907 --> 01:49:03,742
You still have a thing for Doris Day.

1543
01:49:04,201 --> 01:49:08,247
She was a good woman.
You know the strega?

1544
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,000
It's hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye.

1545
01:49:12,918 --> 01:49:15,212
She needs the heads.

1546
01:49:20,884 --> 01:49:22,219
Take this to the witch.

1547
01:49:23,929 --> 01:49:25,514
Now, why does she need that?

1548
01:49:25,639 --> 01:49:28,559
-She takes the eyes.
-Wonderful!

1549
01:49:28,767 --> 01:49:32,271
Puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil.

1550
01:49:32,813 --> 01:49:33,647
And then?

1551
01:49:35,732 --> 01:49:40,028
People get headaches, they go to her.
She looks into their eyes...

1552
01:49:40,237 --> 01:49:43,240
...and tells them who is
wishing the headaches.

1553
01:49:43,865 --> 01:49:47,411
She says a few words, and
the headaches go away.

1554
01:49:48,078 --> 01:49:52,416
Once in a while, the person who
wished the headaches, goes away too.

1555
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:56,753
This guy, Addison, the one
who works for the Mayor...

1556
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,047
...he quits his job in 2 weeks.

1557
01:50:00,257 --> 01:50:03,760
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1558
01:50:03,969 --> 01:50:07,139
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1559
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,225
-He knows this?
-He will.

1560
01:50:11,685 --> 01:50:14,479
The boys he buys for
parties are expensive.

1561
01:50:14,646 --> 01:50:17,983
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1562
01:50:19,318 --> 01:50:20,485
How much does he owe?

1563
01:50:20,652 --> 01:50:24,656
Eight grand with a heavy vig.
I paid that off.

1564
01:50:24,823 --> 01:50:29,119
-You paid?
-Addison's debts belong to me now.

1565
01:50:30,746 --> 01:50:33,248
-You hate debts.
-I hate Addison!

1566
01:50:36,043 --> 01:50:39,254
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1567
01:50:39,671 --> 01:50:41,381
And I like to play alone.

1568
01:50:42,049 --> 01:50:46,595
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1569
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:04,321
His mother named him Edward Goldenberg
Robinson, after her favourite actor.

1570
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:06,365
To continue the Hollywood connection...

1571
01:51:06,406 --> 01:51:09,034
Eddie Robinson took the street name
"Little Caesar"...

1572
01:51:09,618 --> 01:51:12,538
...as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.

1573
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:16,250
He had a 12-year-old son in a
private school in upstate New York.

1574
01:51:17,084 --> 01:51:19,044
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother...

1575
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:22,673
...who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

1576
01:51:23,423 --> 01:51:26,593
-I want you to give me some money.
-All right.

1577
01:51:27,135 --> 01:51:30,472
I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

1578
01:51:30,973 --> 01:51:34,309
I ain't paying it back.
Somebody else is.

1579
01:51:36,937 --> 01:51:38,272
This somebody I know?

1580
01:51:38,605 --> 01:51:41,942
-Your little brother knew him.
-Rizzo?

1581
01:51:44,695 --> 01:51:45,946
How did he know Rizzo?

1582
01:51:46,572 --> 01:51:50,993
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

1583
01:51:51,285 --> 01:51:55,622
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1584
01:52:01,461 --> 01:52:04,006
Count out $8,000.
Put it in an envelope.

1585
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:12,139
You... go back a long time, old man.

1586
01:52:13,557 --> 01:52:15,017
Old men always do.

1587
01:52:15,475 --> 01:52:18,270
Ran with the guineas, back
when the guineas were tough.

1588
01:52:18,312 --> 01:52:19,646
I ran when I could.

1589
01:52:20,898 --> 01:52:22,357
Looked good doing it, too.

1590
01:52:25,277 --> 01:52:29,281
Gave the business some style, some class.

1591
01:52:31,033 --> 01:52:34,036
Made it a call for respect, the way
you wore it... the way you talked it.

1592
01:52:35,662 --> 01:52:37,664
I always liked that about you.

1593
01:52:38,207 --> 01:52:41,543
I'm no help to you.
My tailor is dead.

1594
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:52,888
I'll look up our friend and
collect the money he owes me.

1595
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,182
He owes you something more than money.

1596
01:52:55,724 --> 01:52:57,643
Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1597
01:52:58,143 --> 01:53:00,896
-This is.
-What, old man?

1598
01:53:01,897 --> 01:53:04,107
What's this guy owe that
means more than dollars?

1599
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:08,612
He owes you Rizzo. He's the man
that killed your brother.

1600
01:53:17,829 --> 01:53:19,957
They said he died of pneumonia.

1601
01:53:20,916 --> 01:53:21,583
They said.

1602
01:53:28,924 --> 01:53:30,592
What is the relevance of this?

1603
01:53:31,093 --> 01:53:33,762
So, Ralph Ferguson is
a Sunday school teacher?

1604
01:53:33,971 --> 01:53:36,765
I don't know, counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1605
01:53:37,641 --> 01:53:41,812
I understand that, Your Honour. Again,
I need to put a face to the victim.

1606
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,816
Otherwise it's just another
name in the obituaries.

1607
01:53:46,525 --> 01:53:48,610
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1608
01:53:50,779 --> 01:53:52,072
I don't have a problem with that.

1609
01:53:53,365 --> 01:53:56,702
Your Honour, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1610
01:54:23,312 --> 01:54:25,397
-Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
-Good morning.

1611
01:54:26,106 --> 01:54:29,026
I'd like to thank you for coming, I
understand it's been a long trip for you.

1612
01:54:29,985 --> 01:54:31,945
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1613
01:54:33,405 --> 01:54:35,782
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were such good friends.

1614
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:38,619
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

1615
01:54:38,869 --> 01:54:41,538
We were great friends. It would
be hard to find a better friend.

1616
01:54:42,331 --> 01:54:46,126
-Would you say you were his best friend?
-I was his closest, that's for sure.

1617
01:54:46,919 --> 01:54:50,881
-How long did you know each other?
-About 17, 18 years.

1618
01:54:51,673 --> 01:54:53,008
And did you see each other often?

1619
01:54:53,508 --> 01:54:57,930
As often as we could...
weekends, holidays, vacations.

1620
01:54:59,848 --> 01:55:03,435
-What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
-He was a good man.

1621
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:06,021
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1622
01:55:06,647 --> 01:55:09,024
Objection, Your Honour, statement
is one of opinion not fact.

1623
01:55:09,274 --> 01:55:10,442
He was asked his opinion.

1624
01:55:10,651 --> 01:55:12,778
Overruled. Please proceed.

1625
01:55:14,529 --> 01:55:18,825
Mr. Ferguson... were you aware of
any enemies he might have had?

1626
01:55:19,201 --> 01:55:20,953
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1627
01:55:21,703 --> 01:55:25,040
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1628
01:55:29,795 --> 01:55:31,296
Is that a prison?

1629
01:55:31,463 --> 01:55:33,840
No, it's a juvenile
facility for young boys.

1630
01:55:33,924 --> 01:55:36,927
Your function was what at this facility?

1631
01:55:37,052 --> 01:55:38,804
Standard stuff.

1632
01:55:38,971 --> 01:55:43,058
Keep the boys in line, make sure
they got to classes on time...

1633
01:55:43,809 --> 01:55:46,311
Keep an eye out for trouble,
put them down for the night.

1634
01:55:47,396 --> 01:55:51,149
As guards, were you and
Mr. Nokes allowed to use force to...

1635
01:55:51,316 --> 01:55:53,318
...as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1636
01:55:53,902 --> 01:55:55,904
What... what do you mean, force?

1637
01:55:56,071 --> 01:55:56,947
Were you allowed to hit them?

1638
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:00,075
Of course not.

1639
01:56:00,409 --> 01:56:04,204
Were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the Wilkinson home?

1640
01:56:05,747 --> 01:56:08,709
I'm sure something like that
may have happened. It was a...

1641
01:56:09,376 --> 01:56:12,713
...big place, but it wasn't
the common practice.

1642
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,214
Let's narrow the place down.

1643
01:56:14,381 --> 01:56:17,759
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care...

1644
01:56:17,926 --> 01:56:20,387
...at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1645
01:56:28,145 --> 01:56:30,606
Would you like me to
repeat the question?

1646
01:56:30,814 --> 01:56:31,732
No.

1647
01:56:33,817 --> 01:56:35,944
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

1648
01:56:36,987 --> 01:56:40,073
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems...

1649
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,242
...were hit on occasion.

1650
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:43,952
And how were they hit?

1651
01:56:44,161 --> 01:56:45,996
-I don't know what you mean.
-A fist?

1652
01:56:46,496 --> 01:56:50,334
Open hand? Kick? Baton, maybe?

1653
01:56:51,043 --> 01:56:54,755
-Depends on what the situation called for.
-Who determined that situation?

1654
01:56:55,297 --> 01:56:56,173
The guard on the scene.

1655
01:56:56,924 --> 01:56:58,926
That's a lot of power to
have over a boy, isn't it?

1656
01:56:59,426 --> 01:57:03,013
-It came with the job, sir.
-Did torture come with the job?

1657
01:57:12,314 --> 01:57:14,775
Boys were tortured, weren't they,
Mr. Ferguson?

1658
01:57:14,858 --> 01:57:15,859
Define torture.

1659
01:57:17,986 --> 01:57:19,613
Well, let's define torture.

1660
01:57:22,074 --> 01:57:23,116
Cigarette burning...

1661
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:25,619
...random beatings...

1662
01:57:27,162 --> 01:57:30,707
...solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1663
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:35,879
-Say that took place?
-On occasion.

1664
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:39,049
-Who tortured them?
-Guards.

1665
01:57:39,258 --> 01:57:40,259
Which guards?

1666
01:57:42,094 --> 01:57:44,429
I can't remember all of them.

1667
01:57:46,265 --> 01:57:47,224
Remember one.

1668
01:57:56,692 --> 01:57:57,734
Remember one.

1669
01:58:04,908 --> 01:58:08,245
This line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case.

1670
01:58:08,787 --> 01:58:10,789
-It will, Your Honour.
-For your sake.

1671
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:16,295
Mr. Ferguson, was there ever any sexual
abuse at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1672
01:58:19,798 --> 01:58:24,303
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1673
01:58:26,305 --> 01:58:27,764
Yes, I heard that there was.

1674
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:29,266
I'm not asking what you heard.

1675
01:58:29,766 --> 01:58:33,353
I'm asking... what you... saw.

1676
01:58:34,855 --> 01:58:35,939
Please, Ferguson, don't do this.

1677
01:58:36,648 --> 01:58:37,941
I thought you boys liked it.

1678
01:58:39,318 --> 01:58:40,611
Yes, I saw.

1679
01:58:42,321 --> 01:58:46,158
Did you and Sean Nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys?

1680
01:58:47,784 --> 01:58:49,494
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape...

1681
01:58:49,995 --> 01:58:52,831
...any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

1682
01:58:59,129 --> 01:59:02,883
Counsellors... approach.

1683
01:59:14,895 --> 01:59:16,605
I just fucked your
little friend, Johnny.

1684
01:59:16,772 --> 01:59:18,732
Counsellor, what the
hell is going on here?

1685
01:59:21,568 --> 01:59:23,654
I guess I called the
wrong character witness.

1686
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:27,574
Counsellor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness...

1687
01:59:27,741 --> 01:59:28,909
...now, it's blown up in your face.

1688
01:59:29,409 --> 01:59:31,119
Please Mr. Ferguson,
don't do this, please.

1689
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:38,710
Mr. Ferguson,
please answer the question.

1690
01:59:43,257 --> 01:59:46,093
-Mr. Ferguson, Sean Nokes...
-I like it nice and slow.

1691
01:59:46,635 --> 01:59:49,972
...visited your home on numerous
occasions, is that correct?

1692
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:53,767
Did you ever leave Sean Nokes
alone with your child?

1693
01:59:54,268 --> 01:59:55,060
A child?

1694
01:59:55,644 --> 01:59:58,981
Yes, in other words, would your
ex-wife ever leave Sean Nokes alone...

1695
01:59:59,606 --> 02:00:00,941
...with your child?

1696
02:00:01,108 --> 02:00:02,442
There would be no reason for that.

1697
02:00:02,651 --> 02:00:06,154
There would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child. It wouldn't come up.

1698
02:00:07,155 --> 02:00:10,242
Never came up?
Did she ever voice any concern?

1699
02:00:10,409 --> 02:00:13,579
We have a statement explaining
why she would never allow...

1700
02:00:14,663 --> 02:00:18,333
...Sean Nokes to be in a
room alone with your son.

1701
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:20,085
-Objection!
-Sustained.

1702
02:00:29,511 --> 02:00:31,054
You ain't gonna touch me ever again!

1703
02:00:41,565 --> 02:00:42,316
Yes...

1704
02:00:53,577 --> 02:00:54,786
Yes?

1705
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,584
Yes, what?

1706
02:01:06,256 --> 02:01:09,593
Yes, Sean Nokes had
experiences with some boys.

1707
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:16,475
-Were you there?
-Yes.

1708
02:01:17,851 --> 02:01:21,480
-Did you observe these experiences?
-Yes.

1709
02:01:24,191 --> 02:01:26,485
Did you do more than observe?

1710
02:01:26,777 --> 02:01:28,946
I was drinking then...

1711
02:01:31,698 --> 02:01:35,285
Were there any other guards
around during these experiences?

1712
02:01:36,328 --> 02:01:37,204
Yes.

1713
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:41,750
-With you and Mr. Nokes?
-Yes.

1714
02:01:42,876 --> 02:01:46,129
-On more than one occasion?
-Yes.

1715
02:01:58,350 --> 02:02:02,437
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think
that Sean Nokes was a good man?

1716
02:02:03,855 --> 02:02:04,982
He was my friend.

1717
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,029
A friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after?

1718
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,252
I have no further questions.

1719
02:02:31,049 --> 02:02:32,467
I want this to be over.

1720
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:36,430
I want this to be over.

1721
02:02:39,892 --> 02:02:41,310
Witness is excused.

1722
02:02:43,312 --> 02:02:44,104
Mr. Ferguson...

1723
02:02:46,106 --> 02:02:50,110
Mr. Ferguson, if I were you...

1724
02:02:50,277 --> 02:02:51,987
...I wouldn't stray too far from home.

1725
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:55,073
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

1726
02:02:57,910 --> 02:03:00,662
Michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time.

1727
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:05,209
Playing prosecution and defence attorney,
he exposed Ferguson for what he was...

1728
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:07,628
...and still kept John and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes...

1729
02:03:07,711 --> 02:03:09,213
...hidden from the eyes of the court.

1730
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:14,551
Little Caesar, who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket...

1731
02:03:15,135 --> 02:03:16,762
...called in the Henry Addison loan.

1732
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,641
It was a loan Addison couldn't
afford to pay back.

1733
02:03:21,391 --> 02:03:24,061
And it gave Little Caesar
the only reason he needed...

1734
02:03:24,311 --> 02:03:25,854
...to even his score for Rizzo.

1735
02:03:56,718 --> 02:03:59,846
Davenport wasted little time on
following up on Adam Styler.

1736
02:04:00,681 --> 02:04:02,933
He was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death...

1737
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:06,103
...of the Queens drug dealer, and eight
counts of corruption and bribery.

1738
02:04:21,577 --> 02:04:22,911
That's six for me, two for you.

1739
02:04:27,416 --> 02:04:29,167
Most people play this game
in the summer.

1740
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:31,962
It's easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

1741
02:04:32,629 --> 02:04:34,214
I give a fuck about most people!

1742
02:04:39,678 --> 02:04:42,848
You're gonna have a heart attack...
and I'm not breathing in your mouth.

1743
02:04:44,349 --> 02:04:45,809
Well, I'm not going to marry you either.

1744
02:04:49,521 --> 02:04:52,649
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

1745
02:04:53,442 --> 02:04:56,862
A spic be living in the White House by
the time it reaches their fucking brains!

1746
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:00,198
Snyder came through big.
He's not half bad.

1747
02:05:00,657 --> 02:05:02,701
The way you told it, I thought
he could hardly stand up.

1748
02:05:03,368 --> 02:05:05,537
He's a drunk, but he's not a fool.

1749
02:05:06,038 --> 02:05:07,956
We only win when John and Tommy walk.

1750
02:05:08,707 --> 02:05:11,210
Then you'll have to get them
out of the shooting hall.

1751
02:05:11,376 --> 02:05:14,880
You have to put them some place else.
And only a witness does that for you.

1752
02:05:15,172 --> 02:05:18,217
Now, he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker!

1753
02:05:18,634 --> 02:05:21,970
What if he doesn't show? What if
we have to go on the way we are?

1754
02:05:23,222 --> 02:05:25,057
The street is the only one that matters.

1755
02:05:25,682 --> 02:05:29,019
Court is for uptown people
with suits, money...

1756
02:05:29,186 --> 02:05:32,648
...lawyers with three names. If you
got cash, you can buy court justice.

1757
02:05:33,398 --> 02:05:36,068
But on the street, justice has no price.

1758
02:05:36,235 --> 02:05:39,696
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

1759
02:05:39,863 --> 02:05:44,368
-Out here, the bitch got eyes.
-We need both.

1760
02:05:46,245 --> 02:05:47,955
Then you need a witness.

1761
02:06:35,252 --> 02:06:38,589
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you are to disregard...

1762
02:06:38,755 --> 02:06:40,090
...the testimony of Ralph Ferguson.

1763
02:06:40,674 --> 02:06:44,011
His entire testimony is
stricken from this record.

1764
02:06:44,303 --> 02:06:46,096
That concludes the people's case,
Your Honour.

1765
02:06:46,263 --> 02:06:47,973
-The people rest?
-The people rest.

1766
02:06:48,599 --> 02:06:49,975
Is the defence ready to proceed?

1767
02:06:54,646 --> 02:06:57,482
Your Honour, I don't...
I don't know.

1768
02:06:57,649 --> 02:06:58,442
You don't know?

1769
02:06:58,775 --> 02:07:00,944
Well, I'm not sure that...
we're waiting...

1770
02:07:02,112 --> 02:07:05,115
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Present
a witness or be prepared to sum up!

1771
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:29,181
Everything good?

1772
02:08:05,592 --> 02:08:08,262
I found it very interesting
attending morning Mass.

1773
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:14,434
Your Honour, the defence
calls Father Robert Carillo.

1774
02:08:23,485 --> 02:08:25,237
Father, do you know most of
the people in your parish?

1775
02:08:25,821 --> 02:08:26,905
I know all the people in my parish.

1776
02:08:27,072 --> 02:08:29,449
Do you know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?

1777
02:08:30,951 --> 02:08:33,954
-How long have you known them?
-Since they were boys.

1778
02:08:34,788 --> 02:08:36,123
They were both students of mine.

1779
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:36,957
Remain standing.

1780
02:08:38,166 --> 02:08:40,127
-How long have you been there?
-It'll be twenty years this spring.

1781
02:08:42,713 --> 02:08:43,630
I'm a priest.

1782
02:08:43,797 --> 02:08:45,299
In the case of the people
of the State of New York...

1783
02:08:45,382 --> 02:08:47,342
...against John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1784
02:08:48,343 --> 02:08:50,679
...do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth...

1785
02:08:50,929 --> 02:08:53,432
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

1786
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:55,851
I do.

1787
02:08:56,351 --> 02:09:00,772
Acting pastor, serve Mass daily,
listen to confessions...

1788
02:09:03,025 --> 02:09:06,737
Do you recall where you were on the
night of November first this past year?

1789
02:09:07,195 --> 02:09:09,656
-Yes, I do.
-Where was that?

1790
02:09:09,907 --> 02:09:13,493
I was at the basketball game at
the Garden: the Knicks vs. the Celtics.

1791
02:09:14,161 --> 02:09:17,164
And when did the Knicks game begin?

1792
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:21,543
-About 7:30.
-What time did it end?

1793
02:09:22,377 --> 02:09:23,712
Between 9:30 and 10:00.

1794
02:09:24,838 --> 02:09:26,173
Do you remember who won that game?

1795
02:09:27,007 --> 02:09:28,550
Sad to say, it was the Celtics.

1796
02:09:28,842 --> 02:09:32,054
Kevin McHale and Robert Parish were
a little too much for our boys that night.

1797
02:09:32,346 --> 02:09:33,680
Even if it was All Saints Day.

1798
02:09:34,932 --> 02:09:37,351
Next time, you give me a call,
I'll try my guy.

1799
02:09:37,434 --> 02:09:38,393
I'll try that.

1800
02:09:41,355 --> 02:09:43,065
Father Carillo,
were you at the game alone?

1801
02:09:44,942 --> 02:09:46,276
No, I went there with two friends.

1802
02:09:47,277 --> 02:09:48,612
And who were those two friends?

1803
02:09:50,614 --> 02:09:52,449
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

1804
02:09:54,409 --> 02:09:58,163
-The two defendants?
-Yes, the same two defendants.

1805
02:09:59,289 --> 02:10:03,168
Father Carillo, at 8:25 p.m.,
the time the police say...

1806
02:10:03,752 --> 02:10:05,754
...victim Sean Nokes was murdered...

1807
02:10:05,963 --> 02:10:09,591
...were you still with Mr. Reilly and
Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

1808
02:10:09,925 --> 02:10:11,260
Yes, I was.

1809
02:10:11,635 --> 02:10:15,264
And what time did you, Mr. Reilly,
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1810
02:10:16,932 --> 02:10:20,269
It was around 10:30... a little later.

1811
02:10:20,936 --> 02:10:23,939
They dropped me off in front of the
rectory, near where they'd picked me up.

1812
02:10:25,107 --> 02:10:26,525
Did the two defendants tell
you where they were going?

1813
02:10:27,484 --> 02:10:30,279
No, they didn't, but I imagine,
after a night spent with a priest...

1814
02:10:30,487 --> 02:10:32,447
...they went looking for the
first open bar they could find.

1815
02:10:34,032 --> 02:10:38,161
So then, Father, if the two defendants
were with you at 8:25...

1816
02:10:38,328 --> 02:10:41,456
...the night of the murder, they couldn't
have shot and killed Sean Nokes...

1817
02:10:41,623 --> 02:10:44,001
...as the prosecution contends.
Isn't that correct?

1818
02:10:45,544 --> 02:10:47,838
Not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the Garden.

1819
02:10:50,883 --> 02:10:52,342
He was not shot from there.

1820
02:10:55,512 --> 02:10:57,222
And he was not shot by those boys.

1821
02:10:59,391 --> 02:11:01,476
No further questions, Your Honour.

1822
02:11:02,185 --> 02:11:03,604
Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.

1823
02:11:04,104 --> 02:11:05,063
Thank you, Your Honour.

1824
02:11:10,736 --> 02:11:12,738
Did you buy the tickets for the game
Father, or were they given to you?

1825
02:11:12,905 --> 02:11:14,573
-No, I bought them.
-On the day of the game?

1826
02:11:14,865 --> 02:11:17,075
I went to the box office
about a week before.

1827
02:11:17,868 --> 02:11:20,454
Did anyone know you were going to the
game, other than the two defendants?

1828
02:11:20,746 --> 02:11:21,663
I don't think so.

1829
02:11:22,372 --> 02:11:24,833
Was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets?

1830
02:11:24,917 --> 02:11:25,709
No.

1831
02:11:26,043 --> 02:11:28,420
-No one saw you buy the tickets?
-That's right.

1832
02:11:28,754 --> 02:11:30,756
-Did you get a receipt?
-No, I didn't.

1833
02:11:31,048 --> 02:11:33,926
Paid by check?
Mastercard? Visa?

1834
02:11:34,259 --> 02:11:37,721
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1835
02:11:39,723 --> 02:11:42,351
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

1836
02:11:42,434 --> 02:11:43,268
Very much.

1837
02:11:44,811 --> 02:11:47,064
And there isn't anything you
wouldn't do for them, am I right?

1838
02:11:47,689 --> 02:11:50,234
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1839
02:11:51,276 --> 02:11:54,613
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1840
02:11:55,447 --> 02:11:57,115
Something along those lines, yes.

1841
02:11:57,616 --> 02:12:00,577
And is it true then, as a good father,
you would want to protect them...

1842
02:12:00,744 --> 02:12:02,079
...from something they
shouldn't have done.

1843
02:12:02,287 --> 02:12:06,291
As much as I would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did.

1844
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,170
-Like a murder?
-Yes, like a murder.

1845
02:12:11,463 --> 02:12:15,092
Let me get this straight then.
No one knew you were going to the game.

1846
02:12:15,259 --> 02:12:17,719
No one saw you at the game. No one
saw you buy tickets for the game.

1847
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,388
There's no record you even
bought tickets.

1848
02:12:19,471 --> 02:12:21,515
You have no receipt for the tickets.

1849
02:12:21,807 --> 02:12:25,519
-Am I correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

1850
02:12:26,144 --> 02:12:27,771
Then how do we really know, Father?

1851
02:12:28,188 --> 02:12:29,398
How do we know...

1852
02:12:29,731 --> 02:12:32,401
...you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder?

1853
02:12:33,777 --> 02:12:37,406
I'm telling you as a witness...
and as a priest. We were at the game.

1854
02:12:37,573 --> 02:12:41,368
Yes, as a priest, and a priest
wouldn't lie? Am I right?

1855
02:12:42,035 --> 02:12:44,538
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1856
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:48,917
I always keep the stubs.

1857
02:12:53,881 --> 02:12:54,673
Do you want to see them?

1858
02:13:02,055 --> 02:13:04,308
Why is that, Father?
Why do you keep the stubs?

1859
02:13:05,058 --> 02:13:07,895
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1860
02:13:10,355 --> 02:13:12,274
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

1861
02:13:12,524 --> 02:13:16,820
No. No one ever has. But there's
a first time for everything.

1862
02:13:26,997 --> 02:13:29,625
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1863
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:34,296
Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

1864
02:13:41,637 --> 02:13:45,224
I've never recovered from seeing Father
Bobby take the stand and lie for us...

1865
02:13:45,474 --> 02:13:47,309
...to even the score for John and Tommy.

1866
02:13:48,769 --> 02:13:51,813
He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson's...

1867
02:13:52,397 --> 02:13:54,483
...and the evil that had lived
there for too long.

1868
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:57,152
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

1869
02:14:04,493 --> 02:14:07,287
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1870
02:14:07,496 --> 02:14:11,333
...do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilty or not guilty?

1871
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,501
Not guilty.

1872
02:14:12,668 --> 02:14:15,295
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1873
02:14:15,462 --> 02:14:20,133
...do you find the defendant, Thomas
Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1874
02:14:20,425 --> 02:14:21,510
Not guilty.

1875
02:14:22,386 --> 02:14:25,514
Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

1876
02:14:46,285 --> 02:14:48,579
Hi, how are you?
Could I get a hot dog?

1877
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:53,834
Mustard and relish... a lot of relish.

1878
02:14:56,879 --> 02:14:58,338
Give him two napkins.

1879
02:15:04,219 --> 02:15:05,554
You did good in there, counsellor.

1880
02:15:08,098 --> 02:15:09,558
So, what happens to you now?

1881
02:15:09,892 --> 02:15:11,518
What happens?
I walk away.

1882
02:15:13,437 --> 02:15:15,439
Wait a few weeks,
I'll hand them my notice.

1883
02:15:16,607 --> 02:15:18,609
After the way I handled this case...

1884
02:15:19,484 --> 02:15:21,486
...they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1885
02:15:24,281 --> 02:15:28,076
So, you switch to the other side and work
as a defence lawyer. The money's better.

1886
02:15:29,411 --> 02:15:31,788
There's always gonna be more
bad guys than good, Mikey.

1887
02:15:33,749 --> 02:15:36,418
And can you imagine the work you'd
get from John and Tommy's crew?

1888
02:15:37,502 --> 02:15:38,795
That's a house and a pool.

1889
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,510
Not for me. I've seen
all the law I want to see.

1890
02:15:46,970 --> 02:15:49,640
-It's time for something else.
-Like what?

1891
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:51,475
I'll let you know when I know.

1892
02:15:52,684 --> 02:15:55,229
You know, you're too old to
play for the Yankees...

1893
02:15:55,312 --> 02:15:56,688
...and you're too young to take up golf.

1894
02:15:57,147 --> 02:15:58,982
Why are you shooting holes
through all of my plans?

1895
02:15:59,149 --> 02:16:00,192
You gonna make me panic.

1896
02:16:01,944 --> 02:16:03,278
You'll work it out.
You always have.

1897
02:16:09,493 --> 02:16:11,078
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1898
02:16:13,205 --> 02:16:16,416
I just want to shut my eyes and not
have to see the places I've been.

1899
02:16:19,336 --> 02:16:20,379
I'm weary...

1900
02:16:24,925 --> 02:16:25,968
I don't know.

1901
02:16:29,054 --> 02:16:31,265
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

1902
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:34,851
Well, don't disappear on me,
counsellor.

1903
02:16:36,436 --> 02:16:38,230
I may need a good lawyer one day.

1904
02:16:38,438 --> 02:16:39,565
You can't afford a good lawyer.

1905
02:16:42,568 --> 02:16:44,069
I may need a good friend, though.

1906
02:16:47,447 --> 02:16:49,783
I'll find you when you do.
Count on it.

1907
02:16:51,952 --> 02:16:53,078
Always have.

1908
02:16:59,751 --> 02:17:03,297
A full month had passed since the
acquittal, and no one had made contact.

1909
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:06,550
In those few weeks, our lives had
reverted back to what they'd been...

1910
02:17:06,717 --> 02:17:08,552
...prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

1911
02:17:09,177 --> 02:17:12,514
Carol had returned to her
stack of social service files...

1912
02:17:12,723 --> 02:17:14,141
...helping troubled teens
and single mothers.

1913
02:17:14,975 --> 02:17:18,645
John and Tommy went back to the
streets, running the West Side Boys.

1914
02:17:19,438 --> 02:17:23,567
I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.

1915
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:26,570
Michael, as he'd promised,
resigned from his job...

1916
02:17:26,778 --> 02:17:28,989
...after working the losing
end of a "can't miss case".

1917
02:17:34,244 --> 02:17:35,996
I don't know how to fucking thank you!

1918
02:17:40,459 --> 02:17:43,128
I can't believe what you did.
I can't believe we got away with it!

1919
02:17:43,295 --> 02:17:46,173
It wasn't me. That was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1920
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:48,967
When I first heard he was taking the
case, I was gonna have him burned.

1921
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:52,679
I figured, he's a friend, and if you've
gotta be sent away on a murder rap...

1922
02:17:52,846 --> 02:17:53,513
...who better to do it?

1923
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:56,350
Well, the way he was handling the case,
I thought he sucked as a lawyer.

1924
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:57,976
I started feeling sorry for the bastard.

1925
02:17:58,977 --> 02:18:00,437
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1926
02:18:01,521 --> 02:18:02,981
Get over here, counsellor!

1927
02:18:03,941 --> 02:18:06,193
You are the real Count!

1928
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,654
Alive and well and
living in New York City!

1929
02:18:10,822 --> 02:18:13,158
You fucking maniac! All right!

1930
02:18:15,369 --> 02:18:16,870
What is this, a gay bar?

1931
02:18:18,539 --> 02:18:19,873
It was until you came in!

1932
02:18:20,165 --> 02:18:21,708
Why don't you give me a
kiss to go with that hello?

1933
02:18:28,382 --> 02:18:30,217
Get out of the way.

1934
02:18:35,889 --> 02:18:36,807
Let's have a drink.

1935
02:18:42,688 --> 02:18:44,022
The Four Gladiators!

1936
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:49,194
The "Four Gladiators", worst quartet
to ever hold a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1937
02:18:50,195 --> 02:18:52,197
But what was that name that
Shakes wanted to call it?

1938
02:18:52,447 --> 02:18:55,659
Genius wanted to call it,
"The Count and His Cristos."

1939
02:18:55,909 --> 02:18:58,161
-Nice!
-Well, you know, it's so sweet, isn't it?

1940
02:18:59,788 --> 02:19:01,790
Hey, that would've sent albums
flying out of the store.

1941
02:19:01,957 --> 02:19:04,376
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

1942
02:19:04,543 --> 02:19:06,253
That kid at the deaf school don't count!

1943
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:12,426
One song for Carol.

1944
02:19:13,135 --> 02:19:15,387
-I retired a long time ago.
-Come on, you mutts!

1945
02:19:15,762 --> 02:19:17,764
Don't you guys have to go out
and shoot somebody?

1946
02:19:23,437 --> 02:19:25,564
We always got time for a song!

1947
02:19:27,024 --> 02:19:28,775
Just kidding, you know what I'm saying?

1948
02:19:30,402 --> 02:19:31,987
You pick it, Mikey.
Nothing too slow.

1949
02:19:32,362 --> 02:19:33,196
Start us up.

1950
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:39,286
-How many songs do you know?
-One.

1951
02:19:45,125 --> 02:19:49,796
"Walk... like... a... man!"

1952
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:54,801
"Walk like a man..."

1953
02:19:54,968 --> 02:19:56,178
"...fast as you can..."

1954
02:19:56,678 --> 02:20:00,015
"Walk... like a man, my son..."

1955
02:20:01,141 --> 02:20:04,394
"Go tell the world...
forget about the girl!"

1956
02:20:04,686 --> 02:20:06,396
Don't forget about the girl!

1957
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:22,996
On March 16, 1984...

1958
02:20:23,163 --> 02:20:26,291
John Reilly's bloated body was found
face up in a tenement building...

1959
02:20:26,792 --> 02:20:29,086
...right next to the bottle of
boiler gin that killed him.

1960
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:33,382
At the time of his death, he was a
suspect in five unsolved homicides.

1961
02:20:33,757 --> 02:20:36,176
He was two weeks past
his 29th birthday.

1962
02:20:41,223 --> 02:20:44,685
Thomas Marcano died on July 26, 1985.

1963
02:20:44,851 --> 02:20:47,312
He was shot at close range 5 times.

1964
02:20:47,688 --> 02:20:50,107
The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.

1965
02:20:50,566 --> 02:20:53,735
There was a crucifix and a picture
of Saint Jude in his pocket.

1966
02:20:54,111 --> 02:20:55,571
He was 29 years old.

1967
02:20:57,948 --> 02:21:01,034
Michael Sullivan lives in a small
town in the English countryside...

1968
02:21:01,201 --> 02:21:02,870
...where he works part-time
as a carpenter.

1969
02:21:03,579 --> 02:21:06,415
He no longer practices law,
and he has never married.

1970
02:21:07,082 --> 02:21:08,792
He lives quietly and alone.

1971
02:21:11,587 --> 02:21:15,757
Carol still works for a Social Service
agency and lives in Hell's Kitchen.

1972
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,426
She has never married...

1973
02:21:17,801 --> 02:21:20,429
...but is a single mother supporting
a growing 12-year-old son.

1974
02:21:21,638 --> 02:21:25,976
The boy, John Thomas Michael
Martinez, loves to read...

1975
02:21:26,435 --> 02:21:28,020
...and is called Shakes by his mother.

1976
02:21:30,981 --> 02:21:34,484
It was our special night, and we
held it for as long as we could.

1977
02:21:35,027 --> 02:21:36,403
It was our happy ending.

1978
02:21:37,404 --> 02:21:39,823
And the last time we would
ever be together again.

1979
02:22:29,414 --> 02:22:31,542
The future lay sparkling ahead...
