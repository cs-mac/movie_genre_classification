1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,895
<i>...is not the only
such affliction.</i>

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,855
<i>And so we come to that condition</i>

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,975
<i>which most often afflicts
the more nervous sex.</i>

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,070
Hysteria.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,415
Derived from the Greek
for "uterus".

6
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,655
Much studied by the French,

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,215
it has of late come under the
scrutiny of our Austrian colleagues.

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,711
Tonight, we'll endeavor to add a
British accent to this chorus.

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,717
Bring in the patient, please.

10
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,215
As you can see,

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,175
the patient is a comely woman
of 5 and 30 years

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,895
who has been under my care
at Bethlehem Hospital.

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,135
Of impeccable breeding, she
has suffered much of her life

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,055
from the classic symptoms
of the chronic hysteric.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,735
Who can tell me what these are?

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,895
Lassitude?

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,375
Correct.
Another.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,935
The tingling of the extremities.

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,655
Yes. Another. Convulsions.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,830
Sometimes called
"hysteric fits",

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,695
during which the patient
may become violent,

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,535
<i>dangerously unmanageable.</i>

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,575
<i>Which is why,
as a precautionary measure,</i>

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,335
I've had her injected with
4 grains of heroin.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,434
<i>One cannot be too careful when attempting
to trigger a fit in a clinical setting.</i>

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,495
As I shall now endeavor to do.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,655
<i>Please.</i>

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,319
I beseech you, sir, do not.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,895
Shh, shh, shh.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,095
<i>The trigger point...</i>
Help me.

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,335
Help me.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,055
One of you, please.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,615
<i>Look at me.</i>

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,039
<i>I am not mad.</i>

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,895
I am not mad.
Look at me.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,615
<i>The trigger point may be hidden
anywhere in the female anatomy.</i>

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,415
<i>Most often upon the breasts.</i>

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,476
Do not touch me.
The inner thighs.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,475
Or the ovaries.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,157
Note the clenched fists,
the arched back,

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,876
the tonic and clonic spasms.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,833
Concluding finally

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,076
in a profound contracture.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,655
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,535
She's started
her monthly bleeding.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,869
Next patient, please.
Bring in the patient.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,495
Any questions?
What of the woman's insistence that she is not mad?

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,335
Just as every criminal
maintains he's innocent,

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,135
so does every mad woman
insist she is sane.

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,335
But she seemed so...
Reasonable?

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,015
Perhaps.
Well bred?

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,135
Beautiful?

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,799
She is all these things.

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,798
<i>And quite mad.</i>

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,855
<i>And therein lies
the paradox of insanity</i>

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,615
<i>and the great peril
of our profession.</i>

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,855
<i>Thus, I caution
you all, gentlemen,</i>

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,792
<i>as you embark on your
careers as alienists,</i>

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,375
<i>believe nothing that you hear</i>

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,278
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,872
Bloody hell.

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,255
Hey!
Wait!

63
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,975
Hello there.
Excuse me.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,935
I beg you, stop.

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,655
<i>At first, Dad
didn't want to stop</i>

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,895
on account you may be
a lunatic who escaped,

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,095
<i>but I convinced him
you couldn't be</i>

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,095
since you're headed toward the
madhouse and not away from it.

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,255
Ah, clever deduction.

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,335
And you look like a man who's
only lost his way, not his mind.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,095
Well, I'm grateful.
Thank you.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,615
<i>Are you visiting
someone at Stonehearst?</i>

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,200
<i>Actually, going there to complete
my training as an alienist.</i>

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,895
<i>That's a doctor who specializes
in asylum medicine.</i>

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,895
<i>Well, I can tell
you'll be a good one.</i>

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,415
You have kind eyes.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,795
Aw, thank you.

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,830
The madhouse
is just up that hill.

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,438
You're certain? Oh, yes. Look!

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,015
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,672
Merry Christmas.

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,678
Hello?

83
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,735
Hello!

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,935
And who the feck might you be?

85
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,135
Ah, good God.

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,935
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm... I'm Edward Newgate.

87
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,615
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

88
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,815
Might... Might you let me in?

89
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,175
Well, now, that depends.
Were we expecting you?

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,695
Well, I hope so. I did send a
letter to the superintendent here.

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,935
<i>Must have been weeks ago now.</i>

92
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,270
Well, the post isn't regular
this time of the year.

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,598
Oh, really? I...

94
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,415
I'm just acting the maggot. Of
course you can come in, Ted.

95
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,735
What kind of Christian would I be to leave
another outside to freeze his onions off?

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,255
And on Christmas Eve no less.

97
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,829
Well, thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.

98
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,311
My name's Finn.

99
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,855
I'm the chief steward.

100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,112
Welcome to our little
madhouse in the wilderness.

101
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,775
Presently we have 200
residents at Stonehearst.

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,295
Sons and daughters of some of the
finest families in the realm.

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,655
We have lords, dukes. We even
have a cousin of the Queen.

104
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,295
Now, she likes to finger
paint with her own shite.

105
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,295
There you go, Rosie.

106
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,095
We have a viscount who's
convinced he has two heads,

107
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,255
and an earl who
thinks he's a teapot.

108
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,975
Seriously.

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,655
Wait... Wait here.

110
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,035
The doctor
will be along shortly.

111
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,193
Right, yes.

112
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,935
<i>Trephination.</i>

113
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,335
An arcane medical procedure
performed by savages

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,055
<i>upon those possessed
of evil spirits.</i>

115
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,175
By boring a hole in the skull,

116
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,695
they believed it would allow
the demons to escape.

117
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,815
Let us be thankful we live
in more enlightened times,

118
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,895
don't you agree, doctor...?

119
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,575
Newgate. Edward
Newgate, from Oxford.

120
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,895
Forgive me for turning
up unannounced.

121
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,655
I did write a letter. It's just your Mr.
Finn tells me it never arrived.

122
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,955
An Oxford man
is always welcome here.

123
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,153
So,

124
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,775
what brings you to Stonehearst?

125
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,518
Well, as I wrote in my letter,

126
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,695
I had hoped I would observe
your methods in or...

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,735
Oh, no, thank you.
Nonsense.

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,495
You've had an arduous voyage.

129
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,495
From the backwaters
of blissful ignorance

130
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,415
across vast oceans
of academic blather

131
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,815
until at last
you've arrived here,

132
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,478
on the shores
of my little kingdom.

133
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,040
And at the dawn of a
new century, no less.

134
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,634
So,

135
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,935
it's asylum medicine
you wish to practice.

136
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,975
Uh, yes, since as long
as I can remember.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,375
Why?
I'm sorry?

138
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,735
Why not some specialty that's held in
higher regard? Surgery, for instance.

139
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,815
I don't much care
for blood, I suppose.

140
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,975
Tropical medicine then. Or
problems of the female anatomy.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,230
<i>Both offer better pay.</i>

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,997
Well, I've always been
fascinated by the troubled mind.

143
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,455
So is a priest But he at
least is guaranteed heaven.

144
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,835
<i>What do you hope to gain?</i>

145
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,278
The satisfaction of
helping those in hell.

146
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,775
<i>See, of all the afflictions,
I can think of none more,</i>

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
more cruel than madness, sir.

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,895
<i>See, it robs a man
of his reason,</i>

149
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,975
<i>his dignity, his very soul.</i>

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,718
And it does so,

151
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,375
so slowly, without the
remorse of death.

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,735
<i>Please, sir.</i>

153
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,695
I have the desire
and the training.

154
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,790
All I lack is the
clinical experience.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,855
Time for afternoon rounds.

156
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,015
Of course. I didn't
wish to keep you...

157
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,975
Join me, Doctor.
Thank you.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,596
Mr. Finn, help the doctor off
with his coat, would you?

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,995
Thank you.

160
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,095
<i>You'll find us well-stocked
with the usual cases.</i>

161
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,375
Neurasthenia, dementia praecox,

162
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,015
incurable homosexuality,
epilepsy, melancholia.

163
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,758
But where we differ
from other asylums

164
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,855
is in the social station
of our patients.

165
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,632
All hail from the finest
families in Europe.

166
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,935
For instance, Terrance here

167
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,520
is heir to one of the largest
railroad fortunes in the continent.

168
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,471
And what is the nature
of his disorder?

169
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,935
He suffers from an utter
lack of interest in trains.

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,615
So his family had him committed?

171
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,935
Interesting case this one.

172
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,615
Signore Balzoni was thrown from his
horse during a polo match in Milan

173
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,735
<i>and ever since he's believed
himself to be an Arabian stallion.</i>

174
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,575
He gets a tad agitated
at feeding times.

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,615
Please go ahead.

176
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,775
You'll find most
of our patients are here

177
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,495
because they are embarrassments
to their families.

178
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,873
Outcasts.

179
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,135
Signore, give the
gentleman his arm back

180
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,232
or I shall be forced to
withhold grooming for a week.

181
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,295
You... You groom him?

182
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,855
Small price to pay
to keep him contented.

183
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,415
Isn't that reinforcing
his delusion? Yes.

184
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,175
What, you don't attempt
to cure your patients?

185
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,855
Cure them?
To what purpose?

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,615
Well, to bring them back
to their senses, of course.

187
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,428
And make a miserable man out
of a perfectly happy horse.

188
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,615
<i>Madame.
Your Eminence.</i>

189
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,855
Is it always this lively?

190
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,015
Here we do not believe
in sedating our patients

191
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,455
into a stupor with
bromides and the like.

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,349
<i>We prefer to celebrate them in
their natural unadulterated state.</i>

193
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,919
Check.

194
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,015
Mm.

195
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,495
Good afternoon, my lovely.

196
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,975
<i>Nurse.
Nurse?</i>

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,815
Has she eaten today?

198
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,375
She refuses to eat until her
son returns from the war.

199
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,055
He was killed in action
in Peshawar, '85.

200
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,719
Have you tried a feeding tube?

201
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,278
We do not use such
medieval methods here.

202
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,135
I'd hardly call it "medieval".

203
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,895
What would you call it then?

204
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,375
Well, a necessary means
of preventing death.

205
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,175
Death cannot be
prevented, Doctor,

206
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,015
any more than madness cured.

207
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,270
<i>There's no cure
for the human condition.</i>

208
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,675
And it's a foolish
physician who tries.

209
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,415
<i>Suppose I were to present you
with the following case.</i>

210
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,975
A woman who suffers
from violent fits

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,912
triggered by physical
or emotional contact

212
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,535
that she perceives to be
of too intimate a nature.

213
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,255
Ah, sounds like hysteria.

214
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,455
What treatment
would you prescribe?

215
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,015
Ah, mustard packs,
I should think.

216
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,295
Is she a patient
or a pickled herring?

217
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,175
Pelvic massage?
Potassium bromide?

218
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,476
<i>I'm interested in your opinion,
Doctor, not some textbook's.</i>

219
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,215
Forget bromides.
Open your eyes.

220
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,055
Look at her.

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,775
So, I ask you again,

222
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,015
presented with a woman of
utmost grace and refinement

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,175
<i>within whose breast
roils passion so great</i>

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,615
she fears they will destroy her,

225
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,995
what treatment
would you prescribe?

226
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,575
Music.

227
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,375
3 times a day, no less.

228
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,495
Bravo, Doctor.
I concur.

229
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,295
There are few therapies better at
restoring the soul than music.

230
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,175
<i>Her name is Lady Charles Graves.
Eliza. Mrs. Graves to us.</i>

231
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,295
<i>I presume you know her husband?</i>

232
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,815
No.
Repugnant chap.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,375
<i>Possesses a tremendous fortune.</i>

234
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,575
Not to mention many
unnatural appetites.

235
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,255
<i>As one would expect, her
hysterical episodes worsened</i>

236
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,175
<i>following the engagement, until
one night she bit off his ear</i>

237
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,375
<i>and gouged out
his eye with a comb.</i>

238
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,095
So her husband
had her committed.

239
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,535
<i>No, her father.</i>

240
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,295
If it had been up
to the Baronet,

241
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,535
she'd still be at home
in his loving embrace.

242
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,495
In fact, not a week goes by that I
don't receive a letter from him

243
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,135
<i>threatening me and demanding
I declare her cured</i>

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,335
so she might be remanded
into his custody.

245
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,975
So, you refuse?

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,798
For her own safety.

247
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,655
Come, Doctor.
Yes, of course.

248
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,990
We have much to see
before dinner.

249
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,975
May I just say that your
playing is sublime.

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,015
Oh. Oh, your playing is sublime.

251
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,112
It's quite sublime.

252
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,575
I'm Newgate.

253
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,354
Dr. Edward Newgate. My name
is Edward Newgate. Doc...

254
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,935
Nurse.

255
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,655
May I have a glass of water?

256
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,636
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,655
Your playing is sublime.

258
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,175
What was that,
Mozart, Beethoven?

259
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,236
No, I wrote it.

260
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,695
Of course.

261
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,375
Let me introduce myself. My name is...
Dr. Newgate.

262
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,855
I know. We don't receive
many visitors here.

263
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,655
We're rather
like a leper colony.

264
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,877
Well, I doubt lepers
are so charming.

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,895
<i>I wish you would stop
complimenting me.</i>

266
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,975
It makes me uncomfortable.
Forgive me, Mrs. Graves.

267
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,036
The last thing I wish
to do is offend you.

268
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,455
Are you quite certain
you're a doctor?

269
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,855
Yeah, well, of course I am.

270
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,575
Because I've never known
one to apologize.

271
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,135
Or, for that matter, give
a damn who he offended.

272
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,975
Well, I'm not like
other doctors.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,231
I mean, to be honest, I still
haven't gotten used to being one.

274
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,495
Whenever someone calls "doctor",

275
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,273
I still turn to see if they're
talking to the chap behind me.

276
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,952
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you, nurse.

277
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,775
Right.

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,335
Remarkable, isn't she?

279
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,295
She should be on a stage,

280
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,295
not languishing in some asylum.

281
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,895
Forgive me,
I'm Dr. Newgate.

282
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,335
Edward Newgate.
And you are?

283
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,399
Let Jael rejoice
with the Plover.

284
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,575
Pardon me? And Hobab
rejoice with Heraclitus.

285
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,114
That is Greek for the grub.

286
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,335
<i>Ah, Newgate.
Tuxedo fits, I see.</i>

287
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,815
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

288
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,095
I'm sorry, but what's
he doing here?

289
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,455
Oh, Jeremiah. He killed
his wife with a hammer.

290
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,295
Not without
provocation, mind you.

291
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,535
But what's he doing here
in the staff parlor?

292
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,415
When I was a medical
officer in the war,

293
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,215
we would on occasion invite the
enlisted men to dine with us.

294
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,735
It strengthened the bond between
the men and... kept morale high.

295
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,895
And I believe the same
principal applies here.

296
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,935
It's therapeutic for the patients
to mix with polite society,

297
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,415
<i>and, I might add, for polite
society to mix with them.</i>

298
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,775
Dinner is served.

299
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,310
<i>Good boy.</i>

300
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,415
<i>Good boy.</i>

301
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,655
<i>Good boy.
Good boy.</i>

302
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,535
<i>Tell me, boy, what do you
think of our little asylum?</i>

303
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,415
Why, it's quite... unlike
anything I've ever known.

304
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,775
Newgate recently took his
medical degree at Oxford.

305
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,935
But why come
all the way here

306
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,095
when there are other asylums
far closer to London?

307
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,335
Well, I've always longed to return
to the countryside, I suppose.

308
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,455
You know, I grew up
in a farm in Yorkshire,

309
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,695
and, uh, some
of my fondest memories

310
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,915
are of the cows and chickens
that were my playmates.

311
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,869
<i>You don't have the
Yorkshire man's accent.</i>

312
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,550
Why's that, Ted?

313
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,175
Well, my, my, my parents
died when I was 6

314
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,655
so I was sent to an
orphanage in London.

315
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,399
Appalling place.

316
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,415
But, I mean, you know, fascinating if one
was curious about human nature as I was.

317
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,575
In a funny way, I was
quite grateful to them.

318
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,828
<i>How so?</i>

319
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,695
Well, misery has a way of
clarifying one's convictions.

320
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,335
<i>See, it was in the orphanage that I
realized what my life's work would be.</i>

321
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,750
To labor amongst the
wretched and the friendless.

322
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,695
<i>And to give these poor
souls some small measure</i>

323
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,015
of hope and kindness

324
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,235
in a world
that knows too little.

325
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,255
Forgive me, I seem to have turned
dinner into a Dickens' novel.

326
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,095
Bon appetite.

327
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,695
<i>What is this tonight, Finn?
Squirrel?</i>

328
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,255
At present we find ourselves
somewhat modestly provisioned.

329
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,335
A toast to Mr. Finn

330
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,375
for providing such fine victuals
for our Christmas repast.

331
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,175
Mickey Finn.

332
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,794
Mickey Finn.

333
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,476
I'm... I'm sorry.
Is that really your name?

334
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,295
'Tis. Why?

335
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,108
<i>Well, you know, to slip
someone a Mickey Finn,</i>

336
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,575
<i>you know,
with knock-out drops.</i>

337
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,194
<i>It's quite, quite, uh...</i>

338
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,596
Well, quite.

339
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,175
That never occurred to me.
"Slip someone a Mickey."

340
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,015
That must be how me
da got me dear old ma

341
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,237
to lie still while he
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

342
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,015
You'll forgive me if I don't
find that at all amusing.

343
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,135
No?

344
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,175
<i>What would bring a smile to that
puckered-ass of a mouth of yours?</i>

345
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,191
<i>That will be enough, Finn.</i>

346
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,678
My apologies.
I meant no offense.

347
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,175
Yeah, well, none taken.

348
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,175
That's the Christmas spirit.
Come now.

349
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,399
<i>Let me offer you a little
drink of friendship.</i>

350
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,695
No, no, no.
I've had quite enough.

351
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,535
Come on, we're celebrating.

352
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,735
<i>Honestly, Finn.</i>

353
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,175
I'm sure he doesn't mind raising
a glass to our Lord and Savior.

354
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,335
Do you now, Doctor?

355
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,710
I'd be delighted.

356
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,255
Oh, dear. I'm afraid
that will stain.

357
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,615
<i>Soda water will save it.</i>

358
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,755
Follow me.

359
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,114
You must leave here immediately.

360
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,295
But I've only just arrived.

361
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,015
You do not belong here.

362
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,815
Why, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

363
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,135
There's time before
they get suspicious.

364
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,095
They'll assume you went to your room
to change your shirt, but don't.

365
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,255
Leave your things.
Go straight to the stable.

366
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,135
The roan is the most
sure-footed on the moor.

367
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,935
She'll see you
safely back to town.

368
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,735
You want me to steal a horse?

369
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,637
Lower your voice.

370
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,593
No, not until you tell me
what's going on.

371
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,655
Do as I say.

372
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,975
Leave.
Now.

373
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,798
Eliza.
Eliza, please...

374
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,991
Mrs. Graves,
I'm... I'm so sorry.

375
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,554
<i>I didn't mean to upset you.</i>

376
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,975
Mrs. Graves, indeed,
then listen to me.

377
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,514
There's... There's something
I need to tell you.

378
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,495
Help us.
Please.

379
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,455
Get off me.

380
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,455
<i>Help us!
Help us!</i>

381
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,015
Help us.
We need food.

382
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,255
Please.
Please, help us.

383
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,793
Who are you, boy?

384
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,175
I'm a doctor.

385
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,775
<i>Liar. I've never
set eyes on you.</i>

386
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,615
Where are you from?

387
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,215
Upstairs.
Before that, you fool.

388
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,514
I'm from Oxford.

389
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,655
You listen to me,

390
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,895
<i>and listen carefully, boy.</i>

391
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,375
You have got to help us
escape from these cages.

392
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,055
<i>We're not mad.
We're not mad.</i>

393
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,015
We're not mad.
We're not mad. Please.

394
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,695
<i>Please help us.</i>

395
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,295
Of course you're not.

396
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,215
You've got to help us.
I will, I will.

397
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,455
First thing in the morning,
I'll consult with Dr. Lamb.

398
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,615
<i>Dr. Lamb?
Are you daft?</i>

399
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,495
If he learns that you found us,
he'll slit your throat and ours.

400
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,415
You must get the keys.
Let us out.

401
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,735
<i>Please, we're not mad.</i>
All right.

402
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,079
You've got to help us.

403
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,095
I'll see to it in the morning.

404
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,735
Let us out.

405
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,830
<i>Newgate.</i>

406
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,389
<i>Edward Newgate.</i>

407
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,015
How do you know my name?

408
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,615
Your letter.

409
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,255
You remember, Benjamin?
It was weeks ago.

410
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,350
The young man who wrote
to us from Oxford.

411
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,992
I remember.
Newgate.

412
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,095
<i>Your letter came
with the last mail delivery</i>

413
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,855
before Lamb overthrew us.

414
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,935
Overthrew you?
Yes.

415
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,855
Overthrew?

416
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,295
<i>What is going on?</i>

417
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,415
I am Marion Pike.
Matron.

418
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,455
<i>Charles Swanwick.
Chief medical officer.</i>

419
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,495
Nurse.
<i>William Paxton, groundskeeper.</i>

420
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,135
<i>Dr. Benjamin Salt,</i>

421
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,790
rightful Superintendent
of Stonehearst asylum.

422
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,655
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

423
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,215
If you really are
the superintendent,

424
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,495
then that means
that Dr. Lamb is...

425
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,935
A lunatic demon
of the worst kind.

426
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,615
Oh, good God.

427
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,615
<i>God.</i>

428
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,575
What happened?

429
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,895
They put something
in our drink, Doc.

430
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,135
<i>Chloral hydrate.
It's... It's a surgical anesthetic.</i>

431
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,255
It's colorless and odorless,

432
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,575
but lethal in imprecise doses.

433
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,455
I lost 4 doctors that night.

434
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,495
<i>3 of my nurses died.
Poor creatures.</i>

435
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,015
<i>They'd been planning this for months.
Treacherous bastards.</i>

436
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,255
Just biding their time
to slip us...

437
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,975
A Mickey Finn.

438
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,655
<i>I don't believe...</i>

439
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,855
They give us water,
a pittance of food.

440
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,695
But make no mistake,
Doctor, we are dying.

441
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,375
We are dying.

442
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,735
<i>You could steal
the keys from Finn.</i>

443
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,775
Ah?
Set us free.

444
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,535
They'd tear us apart before
we'd gone a hundred yards.

445
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,215
<i>We'll take our chances fighting.</i>

446
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,455
In our condition,
against their numbers?

447
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,655
<i>There are homicidal maniacs
upstairs with guns, Charles.</i>

448
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,535
Look around you. None
of us are fit to fight.

449
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,279
<i>Some of us are
too far gone already.</i>

450
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,175
There's only one solution.

451
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,015
<i>It's you, Doctor. You're
our only chance. Please.</i>

452
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,375
Run, boy.
The keys.

453
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,175
<i>Run, boy.
Get to town.</i>

454
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,175
Bring help.
Run.

455
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,055
The keys.

456
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,119
Run.
Run, boy.

457
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,295
Who is it, Eliza?
I'm frightened.

458
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,735
It's no one, dearest.

459
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,055
Just the Sandman.

460
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,895
Mrs. Graves.

461
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,015
<i>Is he going to try
and make love to us?</i>

462
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,917
Back to sleep.

463
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,670
Mrs. Graves, we must
leave here immediately.

464
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,477
You had your chance
to leave before.

465
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,870
I have found Salt and the others, Mrs.
Graves.

466
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,095
Do you realize what would've
happened if you'd been caught?

467
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,975
I have some idea.
You have no idea.

468
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,815
We can argue about this later.

469
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,095
Right now I need you
to fetch your warmest coat

470
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,855
and meet me in the gazebo
in 10 minutes.

471
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,135
We can steal a horse,
and if we're lucky

472
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,015
we can make it
to town and summon help.

473
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,215
Why would you presume I
would go anywhere with you?

474
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,055
Because I cannot...

475
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,356
I will not leave without you.

476
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,135
I must go back to bed.
Listen to me.

477
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,550
The lunatics are
running this asylum.

478
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,116
Yes, and I am one of them.

479
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,470
<i>What's this I see?</i>

480
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,375
Evening rounds
are finished, Doctor.

481
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,437
<i>I was just giving Dr. Newgate
directions back to his room.</i>

482
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,400
Lost, is he?

483
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,895
Ah, yes, embarrassingly so.

484
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,975
I was looking
for the staff library.

485
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,434
<i>I must have made a wrong turn.</i>

486
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,215
<i>Well, any event, I know
where I'm headed now,</i>

487
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,695
so I'll bid you all good night.

488
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,695
Thank you, Mrs. Graves.

489
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,575
Finn, see the young
doctor to his room.

490
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,215
My pleasure.

491
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,255
No, no.
Won't be necessary.

492
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,055
Oh, I insist. And I shall
expect you for morning rounds.

493
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,215
<i>Half past 8.</i>

494
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,335
Right.
Of course.

495
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,191
<i>This way, Ted.</i>

496
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,895
Does he suspect anything?

497
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,015
No.

498
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,715
We must endeavor to make
sure it stays that way.

499
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,695
Something is troubling
you, my dear.

500
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,935
This cannot last, Sylas.

501
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,415
Eventually
we will be discovered.

502
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,735
The spring is coming.
People will come.

503
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,895
Visitors.

504
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,911
We cannot just lock them out.

505
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,735
The only reason
any of us are here

506
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,135
is because the world
wanted to be rid of us.

507
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,655
We're embarrassments
to our family,

508
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,975
exiles to the human race.

509
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,975
We will not be discovered for the
simple reason that no one cares.

510
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,560
My husband does.

511
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,149
I promise you

512
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,431
you will always be safe
within these walls.

513
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,015
<i>I'm afraid this
is all I could find.</i>

514
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,508
Supplies upstairs
are running low.

515
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,335
<i>I'll bring more next time.</i>

516
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,335
And some laudanum
for that cough of yours.

517
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,335
Bless you, Doctor.

518
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,655
<i>It's men with guns we
need, not medicine.</i>

519
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,855
That's not an option
anymore, Doctor.

520
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,615
After last night, Finn and his
goons are watching me like hawks.

521
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,055
I barely made it
here undetected.

522
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,175
<i>Come back here.
Please mate, come on.</i>

523
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,615
I could be wrong, but
Lamb strikes me as a man

524
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,975
<i>who would rather see the ship
sink with everyone in it</i>

525
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,815
than give up the helm.

526
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,895
Oh, sweet Jesus.

527
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,295
<i>So, even if we did steal
away and find help,</i>

528
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,695
God knows what would await
us when we returned.

529
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,517
We?

530
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,015
Well, me... me
and Mrs. Graves.

531
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,215
Eliza Graves?

532
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,375
<i>Don't be a fool, man.
She's as mad as the lot of them.</i>

533
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,215
No, no, I...
I don't believe she is.

534
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,775
<i>Tell that
to her husband.</i>

535
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,895
<i>But make sure you speak into his good
ear, the one she didn't bite off.</i>

536
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,135
The man is a monster. She was
right to defend herself.

537
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,335
<i>Mrs. Pike, may I remind you on
which side of the bars you sit?</i>

538
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,749
<i>So, you cannot flee,</i>

539
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,495
<i>you cannot steal Finn's keys.</i>

540
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,935
What do you propose to do? Huh?

541
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,775
Look, I came here
to study his methods.

542
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,855
<i>Now, Lamb sees me
as his protege.</i>

543
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,255
If I could just
maintain that... that trust,

544
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,775
<i>you know, understand the
workings of his mind,</i>

545
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,553
maybe I could
bring him to reason.

546
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,270
He killed 5 soldiers
in cold blood.

547
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,792
And do you think
you can outfox him, boy?

548
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,975
If you could just
give me his case file.

549
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,615
<i>Long gone.</i>

550
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,835
It's the first thing
he'd have destroyed.

551
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,672
Well then... well then, I'd
best be back before I'm missed.

552
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,935
In the medicine cabinet.

553
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,215
Behind the Scotch.

554
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,135
<i>In his...
In my office.</i>

555
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,735
He escaped once before
and he stole it, briefly.

556
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,735
I didn't want to give him
that pleasure again,

557
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,175
so I hid his casebook.

558
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,589
Right.

559
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,375
<i>Doctor?</i>

560
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,135
<i>I want to warn you.</i>

561
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,815
I do not know what
Lamb's plan is for us,

562
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,455
but I do know that if he believes
you could jeopardize it,

563
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,095
<i>he will not hesitate
to slit your throat.</i>

564
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,935
Deplorable conditions these, but
soon I mean to make a change.

565
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,175
And what better way
to bring in the new century

566
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,455
than by doing away
with this godforsaken ward

567
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,735
and all the backward
thinking it represents.

568
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,175
Right, Finn?
Right, then.

569
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,295
So, what do you hope to do
with the current residents?

570
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,935
Introduce them
to the general population.

571
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,935
You're not serious.

572
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,135
Keep a man in a cage and
he'll behave like an animal.

573
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,135
Give him his freedom and
he'll remember his humanity.

574
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,038
And that's your plan, is it, to
create an enlightened society?

575
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,175
Do I sense skepticism
in your question, Doctor?

576
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,055
No, not at all. I suppose
I'm just curious to know

577
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,695
if you think there are any individuals
whose crimes are so heinous

578
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,756
they justify imprisonment.

579
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,175
Sadists... who find
gratification

580
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,295
<i>in the debasement of others.</i>

581
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,015
And those cowards who would send
younger men to their deaths

582
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,375
in battles they
themselves would avoid.

583
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,915
<i>Except for these, I believe
all men can be rehabilitated</i>

584
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,015
often by the simple act of
having their dignity restored.

585
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,855
Who... who's down there?

586
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,575
<i>The Ogre of Oxbridge.</i>

587
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,295
The Ogre of what?
<i>Stage name.</i>

588
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,375
<i>His family sold him off to a
side show when he was a child.</i>

589
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,557
He injured his hand a few days
ago whilst attacking a nurse.

590
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,855
<i>Would you be so kind as to
change the dressing, Doctor?</i>

591
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,535
You expect me to go down there?

592
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,518
You came here for clinical
experience, did you not?

593
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,655
Yes, of course.

594
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,575
Well, 2 grains of opium, I
should think, will do the trick.

595
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,575
Don't need that.

596
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,716
What do you expect me to
do, sing him a lullaby?

597
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,215
Use these.

598
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,312
The asylum doctor's
greatest ally.

599
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,015
Look out for the piss bucket.

600
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,077
Hello?

601
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,695
Now listen here.

602
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,895
I don't mean to harm you, Mr.
Ogre.

603
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,548
I just want to see your hand.

604
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,095
Oh, good God.

605
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,775
It's all right.

606
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,030
It's all right.
It's all right.

607
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,335
Lamb, please help.

608
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,590
<i>Eyes, Newgate.
Eyes.</i>

609
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,352
Arthur.

610
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,232
Arthur.
Arthur, please.

611
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,158
Please, Arthur.

612
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,909
Arthur.
Arthur.

613
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,815
<i>Forgive me, Arthur.</i>

614
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,274
May I call you Arthur?

615
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,335
Can I?

616
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,015
I didn't mean to enter
without permission.

617
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,375
I meant no offense.

618
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,197
I'm Dr. Newgate.

619
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,375
But you can call me Edward.

620
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,118
It's all right.

621
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,015
Eddard?

622
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,935
That's right, Edward.

623
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,535
Eddard.

624
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,615
Now, Arthur,

625
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,095
let's, let's have a look
at that hand, shall we?

626
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,855
It's okay.
All right.

627
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,015
<i>That's it, Arthur.</i>

628
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,335
Bravo, Doctor.

629
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,635
Bravo.

630
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,998
Can you take your
trousers off, please?

631
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,895
No, no. It's, uh,
it's my shoulder.

632
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,295
Please?

633
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,095
<i>I will do that, Millie.</i>

634
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,135
You may return to your duties.

635
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,277
But I want to.
Leave us.

636
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,793
Sit down.

637
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,278
Bare your shoulder.

638
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,278
Stubborn fool.
Why didn't you listen?

639
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,535
You could've left
when you had the chance.

640
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,375
I didn't know then
what I do now, Eliza.

641
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,391
Don't call me that.

642
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,495
Mrs. Graves,
you have to understand,

643
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,935
you are in danger here.

644
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,495
I can assure you I am not.

645
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,953
Give me your hand.

646
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,615
And what of those down below?

647
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,358
What about them?

648
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,855
Mrs. Pike
and the women,

649
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,375
are they suffering terribly?

650
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,994
Yes, all of them are.

651
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,535
You could go down
there yourself.

652
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,975
Or are you afraid that what you'll see
will weaken your loyalty to Lamb?

653
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,535
You have no idea what it
was like here before.

654
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,015
What monsters Salt
and his men were.

655
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,215
How we were stripped bare
and subjected to examinations

656
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,055
of the most disgusting,
intimate nature.

657
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,415
Strapped to tables,

658
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,855
given drugs to dull our senses,
and doused with ice-cold water

659
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,535
and made to suffer a thousand other
indignities too horrible to mention.

660
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,815
But you couldn't
possibly understand.

661
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,775
I can.
I can.

662
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,113
I can.

663
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,478
I can.

664
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,535
I know what cruelty is, Mrs.
Graves.

665
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,711
I know.

666
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,015
And I give you my word

667
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,735
that you will never again have
to suffer the way that you have.

668
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,095
Never.

669
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,415
Why do you care so much
what happens to me?

670
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,175
Because

671
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,255
the very thought of you
locked away in this madhouse

672
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,895
is abhorrent to everything
that I believe,

673
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,516
as a doctor
and... and as a man.

674
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,558
Excuse me.

675
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,295
<i>For Christ's sake, Swanwick,
will you give it up?</i>

676
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,295
We have as much chance
of escaping that way

677
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,535
as a man clawing his way
out of his own grave.

678
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,714
Maybe so, but at least it won't say on
my gravestone what it'll say on yours.

679
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,118
"He died like a dog
in the dark."

680
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,495
You done it.
You done it.

681
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,335
<i>Get to town.
Quick. Hurry.</i>

682
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,759
<i>Get help.
Hurry.</i>

683
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,895
<i>I still don't get
why he's walking around.</i>

684
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,215
<i>He should be down
in a cage with the others.</i>

685
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,535
I cannot continue to run this
bloody asylum on my own.

686
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,055
I need an assistant.
I thought that was me.

687
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,615
With medical training.

688
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,495
How hard can it be
to play a doctor?

689
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,575
"Turn your head
and cough."

690
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,175
"Bend over, young lady, while
I take a little look at you."

691
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,375
Your talents are better
suited to other duties.

692
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,535
Like making sure the dipsomaniacs
keep the bloody boilers stoked.

693
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,135
<i>Bloody icebox in here.</i>

694
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,469
What's he got on you?

695
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,095
What are you talking about?

696
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,395
<i>You haven't been the same
since he showed up.</i>

697
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,215
I suppose I feel a certain
sense of duty towards him.

698
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,415
He has the makings
of a fine asylum doctor.

699
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,992
<i>Reminds me of myself,
a... headstrong, idealistic.</i>

700
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,935
Ah.

701
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,916
Fetch another, would you?

702
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,989
<i>I sense a kindred spirit in him.</i>

703
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,998
I believe he may understand what
I'm trying to accomplish here.

704
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,455
Yeah, well, how understanding
is he going to be

705
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,415
<i>if he discovers Salt
and all them others?</i>

706
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,591
Come the New Year, that
won't matter any longer.

707
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,276
There'll be nothing to discover.

708
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,815
<i>I tell you, I don't trust
that little gutterfuck.</i>

709
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,432
He's up to something.

710
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,575
Perhaps I'm wrong about him,

711
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,655
<i>but he's taken a keen
interest in our Lady Graves.</i>

712
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,095
He won't be raising any alarms

713
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,895
<i>unless he has her on his side.</i>

714
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,175
And that I can assure you
will never happen.

715
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,950
Someone's escaped.

716
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,156
Oh.
Hey!

717
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,231
Here. Here. Here.

718
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,075
If they reach town,
it's the end of us.

719
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,913
They won't.

720
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,999
Come on.
Come on.

721
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,095
Oh, Lord, no.
No.

722
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,935
Now, now, gentlemen.

723
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,335
<i>You get back.
You bastards.</i>

724
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,095
Back.
Get back.

725
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,055
There's no need for tears.

726
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,455
You have my word
you won't be harmed.

727
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,415
Is that what you said
to your mother and sister

728
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,874
before you slashed
their throats? Hm?

729
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,055
Aye, Mr. Swan.

730
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,039
But your methods
have cured my madness.

731
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,615
I'm a peaceful man now.

732
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,655
I am.

733
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,035
A veritable... Iamb.

734
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,695
No!

735
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,595
It's a sad
and shameful thing that.

736
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,695
Come now, Mr. Swanwick.

737
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,951
Let's get inside before
we all catch our deaths.

738
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,791
Oh, dear.

739
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,495
One of them threw themselves
from Stag's Leap.

740
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,055
And this one came
at me like a banshee.

741
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,215
<i>The horse spooked, reared up and
kicked the old pecker in the nut.</i>

742
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,295
Fell down stone dead.

743
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,175
<i>Suicidal tendencies are not uncommon
amongst the seriously deranged.</i>

744
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,556
<i>As we know.</i>

745
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,775
<i>Finn.</i>

746
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,495
See that the body is buried.
Aye.

747
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,397
Dr. Lamb.

748
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,153
Did he stab himself
in the back as well?

749
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,575
He must have landed
on something when he fell.

750
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,670
Something sharp.

751
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,535
Pity.

752
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,630
No, you can't just
walk away from this.

753
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,215
From what, dear boy?

754
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,855
Sir, if you would only just
examine the body yourself.

755
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,375
I am not a coroner.
Nor are you.

756
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,575
Dr. Lamb, this man
has clearly been...

757
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,495
Killed by a horse.

758
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,055
<i>I have an asylum to run.</i>

759
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,575
And you I believe, Doctor,
have patients to attend to.

760
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,735
This is madness.

761
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,855
What did you say?

762
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,695
I said this is madness. Madness.

763
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,175
Madness, you say?

764
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,415
<i>How dare you accuse me of madness
in front of my own staff?</i>

765
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,055
I didn't accuse you of anything.

766
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,375
Two patients are dead, Newgate,

767
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,775
<i>because you were not doing your
duty and watching over them.</i>

768
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,975
Silas.
<i>Where were you, Newgate,</i>

769
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,975
<i>when these two fellows escaped?</i>

770
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,255
How many more must die
because of your negligence?

771
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,111
Silas!

772
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,471
Nurse, I think we'd better
get ourselves inside.

773
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,318
<i>March 1st, 1891.</i>

774
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,115
<i>This enigma called Silas Lamb
continues to mystify me.</i>

775
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,655
<i>Silas remains mute about his
years as a military surgeon,</i>

776
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,495
<i>the war,</i>

777
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,135
<i>and most of all,
the horrific incident</i>

778
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,958
<i>that had him committed
to this asylum.</i>

779
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,975
No! No!

780
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,415
<i>And yet he has
no such reservations</i>

781
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,815
<i>when it comes to
protesting what he calls</i>

782
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,559
<i>my "barbaric" methods.</i>

783
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,335
<i>How ironic to be called cruel
by a man such as this,</i>

784
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,895
<i>a man accused
of such atrocities.</i>

785
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,855
No! No!

786
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,655
<i>When you have found
the thing a man fears most,</i>

787
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,175
<i>you will have discovered
the key to his madness</i>

788
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,316
<i>and the means to control it.</i>

789
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,190
<i>Silas appears
to fear very little.</i>

790
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,655
<i>But all men have
their breaking points.</i>

791
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,975
<i>And I am bound by my oath
as his doctor to find his.</i>

792
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,535
<i>To cure him</i>

793
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,199
<i>and to make him whole.</i>

794
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,815
<i>I believe Silas enjoys
what he mistakenly believes</i>

795
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,957
<i>is his control over me.</i>

796
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,415
<i>In his tormented mind,
his stay at Stonehearst</i>

797
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,396
<i>is merely a chess match.</i>

798
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,295
<i>And I am his pawn
to move as he sees fit</i>

799
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,415
<i>for his pleasure.</i>

800
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,557
<i>But like most children,
Silas seems to forget</i>

801
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,549
<i>all games must end.</i>

802
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,718
<i>And there is only one victor.</i>

803
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,535
<i>October 3rd., 1899.</i>

804
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,695
<i>Over the past 9 years now</i>

805
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,615
<i>I have struggled to determine</i>

806
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,375
<i>what it is that haunts
the soul of Silas Lamb.</i>

807
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,975
<i>A cruel mother?</i>

808
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,295
<i>A sadistic father?</i>

809
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,935
<i>Indifferent God?</i>

810
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,735
<i>I don't claim
to know the answer.</i>

811
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,375
<i>I only know that animals
like Silas Lamb</i>

812
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,958
<i>must be broken</i>

813
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,750
<i>to be made men again.</i>

814
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,470
That's one of my suits
you are wearing.

815
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,815
Fits me well, don't you think?

816
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,215
Of course, I had to
have it taken in a bit.

817
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,975
But then,

818
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,175
you're a stouter
fellow than I am.

819
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,111
Or were.

820
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,855
I suppose
I shouldn't be surprised

821
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,455
that killing unarmed
men in cold blood

822
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,175
hasn't affected your appetite.

823
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,055
On the contrary.

824
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,055
Their deaths
were most distressing

825
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,975
to myself and my staff.
<i>Staff?</i>

826
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,855
A bunch of inebriates and chronic
masturbators more like it.

827
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,032
Funny I've never seen the
harm in chronic masturbation.

828
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,335
Nevertheless,
I bring condolences

829
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,255
and a recommendation that no
one else repeat their error.

830
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,895
<i>And as a show of good faith,</i>

831
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,975
I'll increase your rations

832
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,055
and send down more fresh water.

833
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,335
<i>You see, old friend, unlike you,</i>

834
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,735
I'm not a cruel man.

835
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,878
Whilst, uh,

836
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,775
whilst I'm here,

837
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,175
I thought you might like a report
on the condition of the patients.

838
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,815
I don't give a damn.

839
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,135
They're not my
responsibility any more.

840
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,735
<i>The melancholiacs
are less lethargic</i>

841
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,935
since being weaned off the large
doses of opium you had them on.

842
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,575
<i>The hysterics are less listless</i>

843
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,415
<i>now that they don't have you
poking around their private parts.</i>

844
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,895
Even the mongoloids are thriving since
being taken out of their restraints

845
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,615
and put to meaningful
work in the kitchens.

846
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,135
A pity it's all for naught

847
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,455
when they starve to death.

848
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,615
We are sufficiently provisioned.

849
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,015
<i>I'll tell you what I
think, old friend.</i>

850
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,255
I think that you haven't taken
anything for that cough

851
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,135
because you neglected
to lock the medical cabinet

852
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,615
and the opium addicts
got into the laudanum.

853
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,735
And I suspect that
you're wearing that suit

854
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,615
because it's the warmest
suit in my closet,

855
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,455
<i>which comes in very handy
when you have imbeciles</i>

856
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,118
looking after the boilers.

857
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,175
I hope you've enjoyed

858
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,193
pretending to be sane, Silas.

859
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,255
<i>Has this masquerade</i>

860
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,095
<i>helped you to forget
what it was like</i>

861
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,319
blowing those poor boys'
brains through their skulls?

862
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,317
Mr. Finn.
Dr. Lamb.

863
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,095
<i>Find Dr. Newgate.</i>

864
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,429
Have him meet me in the surgery.

865
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,615
Fine.
Don't eat.

866
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,015
See if I care.
Silly old cow.

867
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,519
Millie.

868
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,855
I'm tired.

869
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,335
I'm tired of being a nurse.

870
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:02,055
Can't things go back to
the way they were before?

871
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,479
<i>May I try?</i>

872
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,999
Thank you.

873
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,335
Now,

874
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,078
will you try one for me?

875
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,895
He doesn't like the taste of it.
No.

876
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,095
Your son, right?

877
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,634
And he tastes what
you taste, does he?

878
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,695
But how?
Right through the cord.

879
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,874
Do you not see how it stretches
from me out the window to him?

880
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,575
He's off fighting
the Afghans, he is.

881
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,956
You don't want me
to starve, do you,

882
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,815
Mother?

883
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,415
<i>Daniel?</i>

884
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,095
Yes.
Blessed Lord.

885
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,615
Is it really you, Daniel?

886
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,095
Yes, it's me.

887
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,975
Listen, no matter how great
the distance between us,

888
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,355
you will always be on my mind.

889
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,229
My dearest boy.

890
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,895
Listen, Mother,

891
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,695
I'm afraid I have
to go abroad again

892
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,815
on a secret diplomatic mission
for Her Majesty the Queen.

893
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,895
<i>Where?</i>

894
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,135
I'm not at liberty to say.

895
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,815
But food is very scarce there

896
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,956
so I need you
to eat for the both of us.

897
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,269
Can you do that for me?

898
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,038
For Daniel?

899
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,215
<i>I will.
I will.</i>

900
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,815
That's it.
That's it.

901
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,655
Well done.

902
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,749
Very good.

903
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,735
No, no, no. Go off to bed.
Get some rest.

904
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,455
I still have the bedpans to do.

905
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,415
No, doctor's orders.

906
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,556
Fine.
Go.

907
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,396
Millie, lock the door.

908
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,695
A couple more.

909
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,815
Very good.
That's it.

910
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,592
That's it.

911
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,392
Very good.

912
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,354
Thank you so much.

913
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,735
Millie really needs the rest.

914
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,495
Lamb has her running herself ragged
doing the work of four nurses.

915
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,815
On an empty stomach,
in a ward with no heat.

916
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,495
Well, in a few months
it'll be spring.

917
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,829
In a few months
we may all be dead.

918
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,295
Pneumonia. Typhus.
Starvation.

919
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,135
<i>Finn, even.</i>

920
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,255
Look, Lamb's experiment
is crumbling, Eliza.

921
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,575
<i>Look, he cannot see it because
he's blinded by madness.</i>

922
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,114
But you're not.

923
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,735
When I first arrived here,
Millie could barely speak.

924
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,911
Salt had put her in a
morphine coma to control her.

925
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,415
Lamb took her off
all sorts of medication.

926
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,055
Had her work on the wards.

927
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,375
It was good for her.

928
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,055
She's grown into a
capable young woman.

929
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,438
Yes, with the mind of a child,
but she's alive, Edward.

930
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,495
You love her like your own sister.
Yes.

931
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,735
That's why I can
never leave her.

932
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,955
Well, you don't have to.

933
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,535
Really, you don't have to.

934
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,335
We can go together all three of us.
Together.

935
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,749
Start a new life away from here.

936
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,135
Where?
Spain, Italy.

937
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,535
Someplace where the sun
is always shining

938
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,015
and the sky is blue,
and... and you can be free

939
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,295
to do whatever you want to do.

940
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,975
Somewhere you can be
truly, truly alive.

941
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,495
I can make that happen.

942
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,135
I can.

943
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,151
Nothing can get in our way.
Nothing.

944
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,975
My husband can.

945
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,958
If he does,
then I would kill him.

946
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,055
Be careful, Edward.

947
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,055
When you speak like that,
you don't sound like a doctor.

948
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,095
When I'm with you, I...

949
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,270
I forget that I am.

950
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,631
<i>I wouldn't get
too close to that one.</i>

951
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,793
Bit of a biter, she is.

952
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,075
<i>Dr. Lamb requests
your presence.</i>

953
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,575
Where?

954
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,477
Follow me.

955
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,375
<i>Ah, Newgate, just in time.</i>
For what?

956
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,575
To assist me in an experimental
procedure of my own devising

957
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,255
which, when perfected, I
expect to usher in a new era

958
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,158
in the humane treatment
of lunacy.

959
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,975
An unfortunate case.

960
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,455
Believes himself to be the rightful
superintendent of Stonehearst.

961
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,255
It's a common delusion.

962
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,655
Ranks right behind
Napoleon and Jesus Christ.

963
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,535
What are you going do to him?

964
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,375
Treat him, of course.

965
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,415
With Edison's miracle
of our age,

966
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,255
we shall banish to history
the straitjackets,

967
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,455
the cold baths,
the nausea machines,

968
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,335
the floggings.

969
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,079
Finn, we will start
with 3 seconds.

970
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,175
I call it "electrotherapy".

971
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,455
And I think you'll be
fascinated to see

972
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,790
<i>what happens when it is applied
to the subject's brain.</i>

973
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,695
You'll need a stronger stomach

974
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,095
if you expect to practice
asylum medicine.

975
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,095
It may look painful, but I can
assure you he feels nothing.

976
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,215
Yeah, but his heart. A tenth
of that could stop his heart.

977
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,549
You may do the honors
this time, Doctor.

978
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,495
What? No.

979
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,855
A dose of 5 seconds
should clinch it.

980
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,599
<i>But, Dr. Lamb, you can't possibly imagine that I...</i>
Do it!

981
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,911
Do it.

982
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,455
And now

983
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,575
you will see

984
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,495
the miraculous effects

985
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,796
of this remarkable new therapy.

986
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,996
What is your name, sir?

987
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,175
I don't know.

988
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,636
Are you the superintendent here?

989
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,375
I don't know.

990
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,975
<i>As you can see,</i>

991
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,015
<i>a mind that was not moments
ago tormented by delusion</i>

992
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,474
is now pacified.

993
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,514
I... Am I in hospital?

994
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,678
You are a patient
at Stonehearst Asylum.

995
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,990
Who are you people?

996
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,956
Tell him, Doctor.

997
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,752
Tell him.

998
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,118
We are your keepers.

999
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,215
I'm afraid that's the
last of the laudanum.

1000
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,435
Thank you, Doctor.

1001
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,615
Now listen. You must
rest if you can.

1002
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,295
You need your strength.
For what?

1003
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,215
Tonight I intend
to set you free.

1004
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,535
All of you.
Tonight?

1005
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,949
Why?

1006
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,255
Because I fear
Lamb's procedure on Salt

1007
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,429
was merely a rehearsal.

1008
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,353
I fear he means to
do it to all of you.

1009
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,828
Tonight.

1010
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:20,475
I never did approve
of Dr. Salt's methods.

1011
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,615
Of course, it wasn't
my place to criticize.

1012
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,935
You know, Eliza said you
were always very kind to her

1013
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,055
and the other patients.

1014
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,311
I loved them
like my own children.

1015
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,313
Even Lamb?

1016
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,415
There is some good
even in poor Silas.

1017
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,876
Though I fear it has become
deranged by madness.

1018
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,639
How do I understand him?

1019
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,719
Your first instinct
was the right one.

1020
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,935
Think of him as your patient.

1021
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,215
Shine the light of your sympathy

1022
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,375
into the darkest
corners of his mind,

1023
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:06,135
and maybe then you'll find
what he so desperately wants

1024
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,575
to keep hidden from you
and from himself.

1025
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,015
Only then will you have
what you need.

1026
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,055
To defeat him?
No.

1027
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,514
To heal him.

1028
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,935
It is difficult imagining
Lamb as a patient.

1029
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:27,512
Perhaps you should spend some time
where he spent so much of his.

1030
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,535
<i>Why won't you let me go?
I want to go.</i>

1031
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,415
Because it's not appropriate
for a girl your age.

1032
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,735
But I'm not a girl.
I'm a lady.

1033
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,593
Quite beautiful one, mind you.

1034
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,415
You should see
how the boys stare at me.

1035
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,095
Listen to me, Millie.

1036
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,655
<i>You must stay in this room
with the door locked</i>

1037
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,975
until I return,
do you understand?

1038
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,495
You just want to leave me here so you
can run away with him, don't you?

1039
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,274
Who?
Dr. Newgate.

1040
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,990
Millie, that's absurd.

1041
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,415
You're going to run away with him
and you're going to leave me here

1042
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,175
to wipe bums and empty
bedpans, and it's not fair.

1043
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,775
Oh, no. Sh.

1044
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,270
There, there.
I'm not going anywhere.

1045
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,975
Eliza?

1046
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,468
Yes, darling.

1047
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,752
What's it like?
What's what like?

1048
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,437
To be in love?

1049
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,835
You're the belle of the ball.

1050
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,315
You look beautiful.

1051
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,719
I suppose you've come
to ask me to dance.

1052
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,638
Believe me, nothing
would please me more.

1053
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,255
But there isn't time.

1054
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,575
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

1055
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,353
There's something I must
do, and if Lamb asks you,

1056
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,895
tell him I've gone outside for
some fresh air. Now tell him.

1057
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,615
Where are you going?

1058
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,655
To find a way to put
an end to all of this.

1059
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,750
Wait.
Edward, wait.

1060
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,308
Oh.

1061
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,793
Eliza.

1062
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,239
How do you do?

1063
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,455
Who? Me?

1064
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,095
Why, I'd be delighted.

1065
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,037
<i>May I butt in?</i>

1066
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,935
Well, well.

1067
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,655
What a beautiful dress.

1068
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,638
<i>And lovely shoes.</i>

1069
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,935
<i>Think of him as a patient.</i>

1070
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,135
<i>Shine the light of your sympathy</i>

1071
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,295
<i>into the darkest
corners of his mind,</i>

1072
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:31,599
<i>and maybe then you'll find what he so
desperately wants to keep hidden from you</i>

1073
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,195
<i>and from himself.</i>

1074
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,156
No.

1075
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,232
Pleurisy, I suspect.

1076
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,375
<i>Brought on by catarrh.</i>

1077
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,197
The...

1078
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,678
The poor child's heart gave out.

1079
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,156
Take the body
upstairs, would you?

1080
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,715
No.
Do not touch her.

1081
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,815
She's gone to a better place.

1082
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,455
No.

1083
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,278
This was supposed to be
a better place.

1084
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,076
It is nearly midnight.

1085
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,855
Someone.

1086
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,855
You. Fetch the champagne.
Bring it here, quickly.

1087
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,269
<i>All of my friends.</i>

1088
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,535
<i>Join me outside.</i>

1089
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,855
The new century
is nearly upon us.

1090
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,655
<i>Peter!</i>

1091
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,935
Where's Peter?

1092
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,255
Peter, my pyromaniac friend.

1093
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,975
You may do the honors.

1094
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,997
<i>Tonight we shall warm ourselves</i>

1095
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,175
<i>by the fire</i>

1096
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,316
of our ignominious past.

1097
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,073
<i>Are you quite
finished there, Ted?</i>

1098
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,775
Spiking the bubbly, I mean.

1099
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,695
You're slipping
them all a Mickey Finn.

1100
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,030
Not if Mickey Finn
slips you one first.

1101
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,295
Well, I wasn't expecting that.

1102
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,215
Ah!

1103
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,735
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1104
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,135
That's the other one!

1105
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,935
Come on.
Come on.

1106
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,839
Now, now, Ted.

1107
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,015
<i>Doctor.</i>

1108
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,015
You're just in time.

1109
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,917
Indeed.

1110
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,639
Ah, there you are.

1111
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,592
<i>There we are.</i>

1112
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,517
Won't you be joining us, Doctor?

1113
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,735
Of course.

1114
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,910
Allow me.

1115
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,615
10,

1116
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,015
9,

1117
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,415
8,

1118
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,495
7, 6,

1119
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,095
5, 4,

1120
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,655
3, 2,

1121
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,415
1.

1122
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,590
<i>Stop!</i>

1123
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,215
Stop!

1124
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:18,313
Don't drink
the fecking champagne!

1125
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,975
<i>Believe nothing that you hear</i>

1126
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,230
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

1127
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,295
Welcome back, Ted.

1128
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:03,615
There, have a little rest
while we set the stage.

1129
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,029
I'll be back in two
shakes of a whore's tail.

1130
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,794
<i>Come on.</i>

1131
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,335
<i>Dear friends.</i>

1132
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,095
A few hours ago

1133
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,415
we celebrated the arrival
of a new century,

1134
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,175
and in a few hours more,

1135
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,175
we shall celebrate
the dawning of a new day

1136
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,335
in this, the grand experiment

1137
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,775
we have been
conducting together.

1138
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,215
Oh, Eliza.
Oh, thank God.

1139
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,575
Please help me
undo these straps.

1140
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,775
Please.

1141
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,075
Eliza.

1142
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,175
It was found on your person.

1143
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,855
Why did you come here?

1144
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,135
You know why I came here,
to study asylum medicine.

1145
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,455
You're a liar.
He sent you.

1146
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,375
Who?
My husband.

1147
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,392
To take me back to him. No.

1148
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,655
I don't believe you.

1149
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,432
Why did you come here?

1150
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,034
I...

1151
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,632
I came here for you.

1152
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:43,855
For me?
Why?

1153
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,599
I saw you

1154
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,415
6 months ago
at a medical lecture.

1155
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,575
<i>I saw you.</i>

1156
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,695
You were there?

1157
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,695
Help me. One of you.
Please, I'm not mad.

1158
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,095
<i>You looked so lost
and so beautiful.</i>

1159
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,575
<i>It sickened me to see you
exhibited like a sideshow freak.</i>

1160
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,655
<i>Look at me.</i>

1161
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,375
<i>I would have stopped it
if I could, but I couldn't.</i>

1162
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,775
I couldn't.

1163
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,775
<i>So, I vowed there and then</i>

1164
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,076
that I would find you and
that nothing would stop me.

1165
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,757
Did you even know my name?

1166
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,855
It didn't matter.

1167
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,935
No, it does matter.

1168
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,415
Saying otherwise proves you're
no better than any of them.

1169
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,135
Than who?

1170
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,175
My family,

1171
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,295
my doctors, my husband.

1172
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,535
You act like I'm some
precious thing to be bartered

1173
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,575
or put on display or possessed.

1174
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,215
It's not like that
with me, Eliza.

1175
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,775
No?

1176
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,711
How is it different?

1177
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,630
It's you who possesses me.

1178
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,655
<i>Excuse us, your Ladyship.</i>

1179
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,495
<i>You must get out of here.</i>

1180
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,735
Go, please. Ride to the village.
Please.

1181
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,655
Time for Ted's big debut.
Eliza, promise me.

1182
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,735
<i>Promise me.
Promise me.</i>

1183
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,479
Eliza.
Eliza!

1184
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,495
<i>Tonight we
will show mercy</i>

1185
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,615
to a man who has betrayed us,

1186
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,695
and through the miracle
of medical science

1187
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,935
we make him in our image.

1188
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,095
And when we are done, he'll not need
to be locked below in a dungeon

1189
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,535
like the criminal he was,
but will join us

1190
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,135
up above in the light,

1191
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,295
fully rehabilitated.

1192
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,074
And we shall embrace him
as one of our own.

1193
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,815
<i>Pity.</i>

1194
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,495
You would have made
a fine asylum doctor.

1195
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,655
You showed a rare talent for it.

1196
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,636
You're mad.

1197
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,375
We're all mad,
Dr. Newgate.

1198
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,278
Some are simply not mad
enough to admit it.

1199
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,815
Crank it up, Finn.

1200
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,989
Now.

1201
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,555
We will start

1202
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,030
with a dose of 10 seconds.

1203
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,135
Wait, wait, wait.

1204
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:27,073
Before you start,
I'd like a final request.

1205
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,775
In my vest pocket

1206
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,895
there's a picture
of Eliza Graves.

1207
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,036
I'd like her to have it.

1208
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,037
Very well.

1209
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,069
Silas.

1210
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,759
<i>Silas.</i>

1211
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,714
Silas!

1212
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,375
Keep going.

1213
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,358
<i>Faster.
Faster!</i>

1214
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,235
Feck, I don't need you.
I'll do it me self.

1215
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,548
Eliza.
Eliza, my feet.

1216
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,353
Hurry.

1217
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,712
Eliza!

1218
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,076
Eliza!

1219
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,815
Eliza.

1220
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,175
<i>Look at me.</i>

1221
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,634
Look at me.

1222
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:45,352
Hit the switch.
Hit the switch.

1223
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,415
Quick, my hands.

1224
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,237
<i>Eliza.
Quick, hurry.</i>

1225
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,775
Everybody out!
Evacuate the building!

1226
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,199
Evacuate!

1227
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,215
Take these keys
and set them free.

1228
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,196
Where are you going?
To find Lamb.

1229
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,835
Everybody outside!

1230
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,119
Go that way.
Keep going.

1231
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,575
Go that way.
Keep going.

1232
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,828
Quickly.

1233
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:46,029
Please help, Dr. Lamb.

1234
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,636
<i>Dr. Lamb.</i>

1235
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,975
They were suffering, so...

1236
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,834
And I...

1237
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,629
It's over, Silas.

1238
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,510
I saved them.
I know. I know.

1239
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,916
I saved them all.
I know.

1240
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,709
The war, it's over, Silas.

1241
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,792
There you go.

1242
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,935
<i>Ladies.</i>

1243
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,111
Let's start putting the
patients in the far wing.

1244
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,135
William. William, you
may come with me now.

1245
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,455
Yes, Mrs. Pike.
Come.

1246
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,391
Inside.

1247
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,655
<i>Eliza.</i>

1248
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,319
Eliza.
Eliza.

1249
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,918
Down here.

1250
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,958
Silas.

1251
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,935
Can you hear me?

1252
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,375
Silas.

1253
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,595
<i>Eliza, he's gone.</i>

1254
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,434
<i>Eliza.</i>

1255
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,935
We could leave now.

1256
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,295
Edward, I can't.

1257
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,255
You can't what?

1258
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:31,655
I can't imagine being
anywhere but here.

1259
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,433
You can't... I'm quite
sure you don't mean that.

1260
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,935
Yes.

1261
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,975
Because you are sane

1262
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,175
and I am not.

1263
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,395
I'm not sane.

1264
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,037
I'm madly in love with you.

1265
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,695
Eliza, listen to me.

1266
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:14,495
Listen to me. There's
something I need to tell you.

1267
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,672
I should've told you right from the
beginning, but I was too afraid.

1268
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,029
Eliza...

1269
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,591
Inexcusable this.

1270
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,031
<i>No way to run an asylum.</i>

1271
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,555
Dear God.

1272
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,951
You realize we've been ringing
for over a quarter of an hour.

1273
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,615
We need to speak with your
superintendent at once

1274
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,914
on a matter of utmost urgency.

1275
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,935
No.
What?

1276
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,396
We can't speak with him?
Well, why the devil not?

1277
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,597
There you are, dear.

1278
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,756
Tea, Benjamin.

1279
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,711
<i>Sodomite.</i>

1280
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,615
Am I to understand it is you
who is in charge here, Madam?

1281
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,029
It is.

1282
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,799
Highly irregular.

1283
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,433
No mind.

1284
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,055
And what is this, sir?

1285
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,695
Release papers instructing you to
discharge a former patient of mine

1286
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,895
named Eliza Graves and
remit her to our custody.

1287
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,895
I'm afraid I cannot, sir.

1288
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,535
What?
Why not?

1289
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,615
Because she was discharged
three weeks ago.

1290
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,815
On whose orders?

1291
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,775
Dr. Newgate's.

1292
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,295
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

1293
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:13,975
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

1294
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,775
That's impossible.
Why?

1295
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,873
Because, my good woman,
I am Dr. Edward Newgate.

1296
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,295
It's as I feared.
We're too late.

1297
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,335
<i>Would someone please tell
me what's going on?</i>

1298
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,575
The young man
you knew as Dr. Newgate

1299
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,895
is neither a Newgate
nor a doctor.

1300
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,055
How silly.
Of course he was a doctor.

1301
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,310
I can assure you, madame,
he is not.

1302
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,815
Well, who is he then?

1303
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,015
A very cunning
and disturbed patient

1304
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,855
who until 2 months ago
was under my care

1305
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,495
at Bethlehem Royal
Hospital in London.

1306
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,335
Forgive me, but that
makes no sense, Doctor.

1307
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,535
Why would he go to the trouble of escaping
from one asylum only to enter another?

1308
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,375
To find my wife.

1309
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,055
<i>Next patient.
Any questions?</i>

1310
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:12,535
<i>It seems he became unduly
infatuated with Lady Graves</i>

1311
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,393
<i>at a medical demonstration
I gave at Oxford.</i>

1312
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:29,535
<i>Some time after that, he
managed to escape his room,</i>

1313
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:35,015
<i>elude two orderlies, and flee
via a laundry chute,</i>

1314
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,575
<i>in the process
stealing my pocket watch,</i>

1315
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,095
<i>my Derringer, and my, uh...</i>

1316
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,236
Identity.

1317
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,495
In any event, suffice it to say,

1318
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,215
he's a very disturbed young man.

1319
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,775
He suffers
from Pseudologia fantastica,

1320
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,095
<i>one of the most severe
cases I've ever encountered.</i>

1321
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,095
<i>In all the years I've known him,</i>

1322
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,236
<i>I've never uncovered
his true identity.</i>

1323
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,815
<i>It could very well be
that he's an empty shell</i>

1324
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,513
<i>incapable of true feeling</i>

1325
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,431
beyond a cure.

1326
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:15,455
Check

1327
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,710
mate.

1328
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,975
<i>You'll excuse me
if I disagree, Doctor.</i>

1329
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,495
<i>No one is beyond cure.</i>

1330
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,615
<i>In fact, I believe your
young man has found his.</i>

1331
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,415
<i>What precisely might that be?</i>

1332
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,194
<i>Not what.
Who.</i>

1333
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,375
Shall we, Mrs. Lamb?

1334
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,470
With pleasure, Dr. Lamb.
