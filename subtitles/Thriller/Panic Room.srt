1
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,560
I wrote it all down:
4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,360
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,940
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,530
-Is that the listing sheet?
-There is no listing sheet.

5
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,320
I heard about it this morning.
It'll be gone by this afternoon

6
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,490
-Well, how many more after this one?
-None. You know how tight the market is.

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,580
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,460
Evan!

9
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,800
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,430
You'll realise that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,480
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,480
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,020
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,980
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,160
It's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,700
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,540
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlour floor.

20
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,830
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,630
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,760
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,260
Sarah.

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,220
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,180
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,560
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,190
I don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,610
It's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,240
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,290
It allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,460
Working elevator.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,460
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,960
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,300
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,640
It's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,230
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,270
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,770
Can I see it first?

40
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,400
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,990
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,990
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,750
It's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,040
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,420
It's a fortune.

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,750
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,930
He can afford it.

48
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,100
It would be so lovely
if I could show the property before I leave.

49
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,780
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,320
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,360
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,240
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,950
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,410
I don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,290
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,090
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,680
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,850
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,680
May I ask what you do, Mrs...

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,560
Altman.

61
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,190
Actually, I'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,360
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,200
I didn't realise
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,070
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,530
Master bath.

66
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,080
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,750
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,130
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,130
I hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,510
Stop calling it "the property."
It sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,890
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,100
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,810
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,690
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,410
That's strange.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,660
What?

78
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,250
Is this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,420
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,220
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,070
It's called a panic room.

82
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,900
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,110
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-I've read about these.

84
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,450
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,200
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,660
This is perfect.

87
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,000
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,840
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? I think not.

90
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,010
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,850
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,140
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,850
Why?

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,770
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,110
No, but I loved her last album.

97
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,610
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,860
Steel.

99
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,570
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,240
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,950
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,960
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,170
Open it, please.

104
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,840
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,130
Please open the door.

106
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,800
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,840
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,770
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,480
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,980
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,490
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,200
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,450
It couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,090
I know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,660
It's working. I hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,700
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,540
579 what?

118
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,700
3000.

119
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,210
Patsy's Pizza. please hold.

120
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,400
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,900
What do you mean?

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,360
Our first night.
I should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,940
I like pizza.

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,210
Fuck him.

126
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,760
Don't.

127
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,050
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,010
I agree.

129
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,810
But don't.

130
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,670
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,250
You never asked
what I thought of this house.

133
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,460
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,880
-I liked our old house.
-Well, so did I.

135
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,340
You know what I was thinking?

136
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,100
I was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,060
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,060
Go ahead.

139
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,570
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,860
I forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,320
Dad already did it.
I'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh, yeah?

143
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,370
So I'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,540
Is that what he said?

145
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,460
Isn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,670
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,170
I'll ride with you.

148
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,510
Why'd you bring me here
if I can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,180
That's it. I quit.

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,140
Come here.

152
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,810
It's disgusting how much I love you.

153
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,560
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,070
-Mom?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,580
It's too dark.

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,880
Better?

157
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,840
That's better.

158
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,750
"Bypass non-ready zone."

159
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,550
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,380
"Shunt. Enter."

161
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,440
"Bypass non-ready zone."

162
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,100
"Shunt."

163
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,230
"Enter zone number."

164
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,740
"Shunt again."

165
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,910
In the morning I got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,530
Go, go back.

167
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,830
Do it.

168
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,510
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,260
Amateur.

170
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,430
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,140
It's about time. I'm freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,020
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

173
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,570
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,530
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,990
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

176
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,740
Open the fucking door.

177
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,330
No shit.

178
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,420
What is this?

179
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,880
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,380
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,720
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,760
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,850
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,480
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

185
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,610
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,320
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,160
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,990
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,710
Right?

190
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,120
I'm out of here.

191
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,130
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,460
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,800
It's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,140
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

195
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,140
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,020
It's just her and the kid!

197
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,060
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,270
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,360
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,820
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

201
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,870
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.

202
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,000
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,710
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,840
I don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,510
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,850
Who are you?

208
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,520
I'm Raoul.

209
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,040
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,910
This is still a good plan.

211
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,250
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
It's just got a slight twist.

212
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,670
Yeah.

213
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,800
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,890
No family.

216
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,720
You're right. It's all fucked up.
I fucked it up!

217
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,890
It's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,440
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,700
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,870
Hey, I want that money. I want it!

221
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,620
But you...

222
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,040
...you need that money.

223
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,090
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,260
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,430
Kill the phones.

226
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,810
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,560
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,780
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,450
Get up!

230
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,330
What did you do that for?

231
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,680
Where are you going?

232
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,270
-What's going on?
-People. In the house.

233
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,190
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,550
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,130
I told you. I don't hurt people.

236
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,510
They're going downstairs.

237
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,180
-That room.
-What?

238
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,770
The panic room.

239
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,440
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,110
Fuck!

241
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,110
Coming back up!

242
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,710
That's you.

243
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,050
Shit.

244
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,600
Go!

245
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,890
Fuck!

246
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,560
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,570
Damn it! Mother--

248
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,530
Shit!

249
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,830
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,130
Shit.

251
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,770
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,920
Oh, damn.

253
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,590
-It doesn't work?
-It's a different phone line.

254
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,550
I never hooked it up.

255
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,720
Now what?

256
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,170
I can't hear a thing.

257
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,880
What do you think they want?

258
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,840
I don't know. Rob us...

259
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,130
I don't know.

260
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,800
What do we do?

261
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,970
We wait.

262
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,930
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

263
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,810
They can't get in. It's not possible.

264
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,520
Mom. I heard you.

265
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,650
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

266
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,190
-You shaky?
-No.

267
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,740
-Chills?
-No.

268
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,540
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,470
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,390
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,810
Here he comes.

272
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,900
I locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,940
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,230
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,450
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,660
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,410
I checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,540
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,580
-I thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

280
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,590
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

281
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,300
Do it.

282
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,930
Excuse me.

283
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,270
The police are on their way.

284
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,990
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

285
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,200
It's not an intercom. It's a PA system.

286
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,000
I know. I'm just scaring her.

287
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,540
I suggest you leave before they get here.

288
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,220
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,760
How could he know that?

290
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,470
Take what you want and get out!

291
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,520
If only it were that easy.

292
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,850
Some paper. I need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,610
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,490
-What is he doing?
-I don't know.

296
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,050
"What we want is in that room"?

297
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,930
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,350
What do you know about this room?

300
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,180
What do we know about that room?

301
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,680
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

302
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,120
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,160
Get out of my house!

304
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,540
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

305
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,500
-Mom.
-What?

306
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,550
"Get the fuck out of my house."

307
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,800
Get the fuck out of my house!

308
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,810
Okay, I have an idea.

309
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,730
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,770
She won't believe you.

311
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,820
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,580
Conversation's over!

313
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,170
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,760
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,010
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,470
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,720
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

318
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,930
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,520
If cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,400
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,770
How do we get into that room?

322
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,160
What is funny about this?

323
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,910
Is this shit funny to you?

324
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,330
I spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,660
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,630
It's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,460
We can't.

328
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,220
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,970
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,260
And why would she do that?

331
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,430
I don't know.

332
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,650
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,030
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
...and I don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,660
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,240
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,830
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm working on that.

339
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,260
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

340
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,770
Small space?

341
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,770
I'm okay.

342
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,810
-You can't wig out.
-I know.

343
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,650
-I mean it.
-I won't.

344
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,610
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,700
I guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,990
Really?

347
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,660
Yeah, I read that.

348
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,210
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,800
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,760
What are they doing now?

351
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,810
I don't know.

352
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,120
They're locking us in.

353
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,250
This is not happening.

354
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,300
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,810
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,270
Sarah!

357
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,260
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

358
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,890
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,720
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,890
We'll see.

361
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,390
Hey. This is what I do.

362
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,520
If some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,730
...do you really think
that I would still have a job?

364
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,490
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,110
Neighbour.

366
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,570
Help!

367
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,990
Please help us!

368
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

369
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
Help us!

370
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,970
Help!

371
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,140
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

372
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,430
Shit!

373
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,710
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,510
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,960
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,640
Could you be any louder?

377
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,980
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,650
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,620
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

381
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,000
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,700
Oh, this is good.

383
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,870
This could work.

384
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,330
I was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,380
-Open it.
-I just did.

386
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,340
Open it some more.

387
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,340
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,090
They'll get the point.

389
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,760
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,770
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,980
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

392
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,690
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,200
What is it?

394
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,950
It's bad.

395
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,580
They're coughing.

396
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,210
If they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,960
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,380
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,860
Mom.

400
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,820
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,120
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,000
Cut it back a little.

403
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,080
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,250
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,800
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,100
Turn it down.

407
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,310
Turn it down! It's too much!

408
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,980
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

409
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,360
I'm turning it down.

410
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,950
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

411
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,550
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

412
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,880
-No.
-Turn it down.

413
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,600
-Mom?
-Just a second.

414
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,360
Get under this.

415
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,200
Oh, my god.

416
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,120
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-It's my fucking idea.

417
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,630
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

418
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,530
What is that?

419
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,530
Turn the gas off.

420
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,590
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,570
Get back!

422
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,360
Shit!

423
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,620
God!

424
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,040
Get it off me!

425
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,670
It's okay.

426
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,010
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
I'm coming in there!

427
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,180
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,320
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,360
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,570
I won't.

431
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,960
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,390
What?

433
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,390
Talk to him.

434
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,850
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,290
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

436
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,130
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,670
Titanic.

438
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,140
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,650
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,620
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,200
Get up.

442
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,660
Come on.

443
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,170
Wake up.

444
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,520
The first thing I'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,610
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,820
I want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:22,990
Fine!

448
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:27,410
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,210
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,860
Got him.

451
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,320
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,900
I'm not losing
my half of the money because--

453
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,490
Slow down. Half?

454
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:08,030
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third...

455
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,250
Come on.

456
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,590
I'm letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,590
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,010
You're right. It wasn't your idea!

459
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,260
None of this was your idea!
It was my idea!

460
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,520
Come on, look over here.

461
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,150
Yes.

462
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,320
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,290
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,300
-We're here!
-Help us!

465
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,170
We're over here!

466
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,890
Help!

467
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,190
Open your window!

468
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,600
Help!

469
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,450
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,170
I'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,670
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,880
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,470
Are you done?

474
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,850
No. I'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,810
I'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

476
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,770
Wait a minute.

477
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,150
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,120
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,450
Where's the third guy?

480
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
I left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,500
I earned that money.

482
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,300
I will not let you jeopardise
my fucking plan...

483
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:30,720
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,560
Got it?

485
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,060
If I don't come back, close this door.

486
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,940
Just do what I say.

487
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,190
He touches me again, I'll shoot him.

488
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,320
Christ!

489
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,990
Wait!

490
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,830
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,250
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,290
I'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,790
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,590
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,550
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,590
...because I saw that movie, too.

497
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,010
What is this?

498
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,720
I got some news for you.

499
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,390
Go.

500
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,060
Go!

501
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,880
Fuck!

502
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,550
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,640
No.

504
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,970
Charger!

505
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,850
She has a cell phone.

506
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,350
No!

507
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,650
All right, signal.

508
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,570
Come on. Signal.

509
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,540
I don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,250
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

511
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,720
No signal.

512
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,100
I didn't hook up this line,
but I hooked up the main line.

513
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,730
If we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,530
I can't go to prison, man.
I'm not built for that shit.

515
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,830
Be careful.

516
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,640
Get the phone.

517
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,930
-It doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

518
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,650
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,370
Junior, when I asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,960
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,860
Shit!

522
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,030
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,370
-What are we doing?
-I have no idea.

524
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,070
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

525
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,400
Okay.

526
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,490
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,790
Okay.

528
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,420
Dial tone.

529
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,770
911 emergency.

530
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,690
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

531
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,980
-please hold.
-No, no. God.

532
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,570
Call Dad.

533
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,500
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,000
-Hello?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,960
-Who is this?
-It's Meg.

536
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,470
Do you know what time it is?

537
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,140
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

538
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,100
Move.

539
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,600
-Hello?
-You've got to help us.

540
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,650
Move!

541
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,150
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

542
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,490
What--

543
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,590
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

544
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,210
He'll call the police.

545
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,510
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,140
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:14,310
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,850
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,230
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

550
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,530
I'm sorry.

551
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,950
No, I'm sorry.

552
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,120
Why?

553
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,490
I was trying not to tell you.

554
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,710
What?

555
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,330
I'm dizzy and hungry.

556
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,840
All she's got is Nyquil and fucking Midol.

557
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,760
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,890
Whose fault was that?

559
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,390
This is impossible.

560
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,270
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,060
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,940
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,030
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,610
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,490
I'm just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,660
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:19,040
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,830
Let's check it again.

569
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,330
Mom, I did it.

570
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,590
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,880
If  we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,510
You're making me nervous.

573
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,380
I'm sorry.

574
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,550
What if I keep dropping?

575
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,680
You won't. I'll figure something out.

576
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,980
You know, he's right.

577
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,190
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,860
What are you talking about?

579
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,110
I just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,530
I don't need to be involved...

581
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,450
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,410
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

583
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:05,290
I don't need the fucking aggravation.
I'll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,550
They'll find the floor safe. I'll inherit.

585
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,470
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,100
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:20,390
Fuck, I'll still put away 8 or 9 hundred grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,310
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,980
Wait a minute.

590
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,150
Say what you just said again.

591
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,830
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,420
When? Before?

593
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,040
Yeah, before.

594
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,840
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,880
What are you doing?

596
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:55,970
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,720
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,650
-I'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

599
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,360
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,030
Where else?

601
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,610
Travel kit.

602
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,490
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,120
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,460
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,540
...so now I don't know what to think.

606
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,500
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,550
How much is in there?

608
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,180
Mouthwash.

609
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,010
Saccharin.

610
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,600
Hey, I'm talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,480
Fine. There's more.

612
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:50,320
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,820
It doesn't matter now.
It's totally fucking moot!

614
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,780
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

615
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,320
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,530
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,950
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,750
What's the matter with you?

619
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,880
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,550
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,430
Your eyes were huge
when I told you about the gig...

622
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,930
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,510
Things didn't work out.

624
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,560
Play past it.

625
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,770
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,520
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,150
I'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,150
It's looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,080
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,910
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,250
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,130
I'll see you, Burnham.

633
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,630
Later, Raoul.

634
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,100
Mom!

635
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,150
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,450
...think you know all about it.

637
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,490
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,540
Sarah, listen to me:

639
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,620
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

640
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,790
Okay.

641
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,840
You should see the look on your face.

642
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,510
What's happening?

643
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,100
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

644
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,560
Come here.

645
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,020
Come here.

646
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,020
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

647
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:55,520
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

648
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,200
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

649
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,870
Clown? Idiot? Fucking asshole?

650
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,210
Who's the clown now?

651
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,330
Me.

652
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,880
That's right.

653
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,170
It's burning me.

654
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,670
Who's got the gun?

655
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,420
You.

656
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,680
Remember that.

657
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,890
Find out who the fuck that is.

658
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,180
Give me your wallet.

659
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,940
Give me your wallet.

660
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,400
Stephan Altman.

661
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,870
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

662
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,040
What did she say?

663
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,090
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,920
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

665
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,260
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,770
No.

667
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,020
He's telling the truth.

668
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,310
Yeah.

669
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,190
Yeah, he probably is.

670
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,280
Because when I do this, people don't lie.

671
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,690
What?

672
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,240
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

673
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:26,780
-I can't.
-Yeah, you can.

674
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,790
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

675
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,910
You want me to just make something up?

676
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,170
You've got till the count of three.

677
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,750
Then you end up like Junior over there.

678
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,010
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

679
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,220
Two, squeeze.

680
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,930
I don't know what to tell you.

681
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,180
-Three.
-Wait!

682
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,010
Okay.

683
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,430
I got an idea.

684
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,110
Maybe.

685
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,650
Maybe.

686
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:05,240
Help! Rubber Soul...

687
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,950
...Yesterday and Today,
Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album...

688
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,330
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

689
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,750
Let It Be, Reviver, Sgt. pepper...

690
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, god!

691
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,460
Dad?

692
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,760
No, no.

693
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,650
Take it easy.

694
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,860
Open the door! Open the door!

695
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,740
No.

696
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,160
Don't open the door!

697
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,920
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

698
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,630
Open the door!

699
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:08,880
Don't open--

700
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,930
Knock it off!

701
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,150
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

702
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,200
Oh, god.

703
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,530
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

704
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,040
Lie down.

705
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,460
All right.

706
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,000
You'll be fine. Come on.

707
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,300
He's fucking crazy.

708
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,260
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

709
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,510
You're a strong girl.

710
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:55,010
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

711
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,520
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

712
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,600
It's almost over.

713
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,610
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

714
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,470
All right, turn around.

715
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,390
I'll be right back.

716
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,770
It's got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

717
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,970
Get your tapes.

718
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,290
Who's this?

719
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,130
It's her kid.

720
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:32,050
What happened to her?

721
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,920
Who gives a fuck?

722
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,450
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

723
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,700
Hey, lady.

724
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:46,790
Mom?

725
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,630
What are you doing?

726
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:58,010
What are you doing?

727
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,480
We've got your kid.

728
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,440
Come down here.

729
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,280
Let's get this over with.

730
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,790
Get her, get her!

731
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,720
Shit!

732
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,360
What happened?

733
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,480
No! Let her out!

734
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,110
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

735
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,530
No!

736
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,580
-Where's your gun?
-I don't know.

737
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,250
Open up!

738
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,790
Open it.

739
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,550
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

740
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,180
She's got your gun!

741
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,300
Stop screaming. Stop it.

742
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:49,120
I know you've got the gun.

743
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,040
put the gun down
and step away from the door.

744
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,920
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

745
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,090
She needs an injection.

746
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,470
Do you hear me?

747
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,130
Open the door so I can give her a shot.

748
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,760
Or I swear to God, I'll kill you both.

749
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,640
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.

750
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,940
So give her the shot yourself.

751
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:20,110
Give her the shot!

752
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,830
Do you need this?

753
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,670
Can you do this yourself?

754
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,380
What happens if you don't get it?

755
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,180
Coma.

756
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:52,760
Die.

757
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,940
Fuck! Open it.

758
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:07,320
put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.

759
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,950
And I'll give her the shot, all right?

760
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,840
I told you to leave the gun!

761
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,470
Shit.

762
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,700
You fucking bitch!

763
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:01,250
If you pull any shit like that again,
I will fucking kill her.

764
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,040
Do you hear me?

765
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:07,460
If you step outside, I'll kill her!

766
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:13,640
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'll cut her fucking throat!

767
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,720
Do you understand?

768
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,690
Yes.

769
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,530
But please, just give her the shot.

770
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:31,360
Please.

771
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:34,870
please.

772
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,830
Don't fucking do it.

773
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:42,830
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

774
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,920
Are you going to open the safe?

775
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:52,300
Don't you look at me.

776
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,520
All I know about this is what I see on TV.

777
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,570
You got to talk me through this.

778
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,950
This right here?

779
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,200
It's this?

780
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,130
Yeah, okay.

781
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,180
Nice house you guys got.

782
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,430
Your mom's rich.

783
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,350
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

784
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,200
Tap it.

785
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:20,390
I wish I could have put my kid in
a place like this.

786
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,310
It's not that I didn't try.

787
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,150
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,110
Done.

789
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,860
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

790
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,740
He had it all worked out.

791
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:41,620
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

792
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,620
Thanks...

793
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,040
...Burnham.

794
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:55,840
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

795
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,010
She's going to be okay.

796
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,350
I gave her the shot. She's all right.

797
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,640
It'll be over soon.

798
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:27,870
Stephan.

799
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,090
Oh, my god.

800
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,880
Can you move?

801
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,300
Not much. I think my arm is broken.

802
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,950
Raise your arm.

803
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,330
Come on, raise your arm.

804
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,850
Try again.

805
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
Come on. Try again.

806
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,360
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:39,190
They're going to kill us.

808
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,110
Just do everything they ask.
It'll be okay that way.

809
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:45,030
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,760
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,340
The police.

812
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,720
You called the police?

813
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,640
Of course, I called them.

814
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,770
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,430
She killed the kid.

816
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:14,690
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,190
All right, take this.

818
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,860
Don't say a word.

819
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:27,030
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,910
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!

821
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,870
Where is she?

822
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,090
There.

823
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,920
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,270
She's going to handle it.

825
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,410
I'm just trying to unlock...

826
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,660
-Is everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

827
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:18,960
What are you... What time is it?

828
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:22,340
It's a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,260
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,930
Somebody called you?

831
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,970
Can we come in?

832
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:31,640
What do you want?

833
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:34,930
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

834
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,310
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,270
I'm fine.

836
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,530
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:54,410
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:58,630
Come on, I'm freezing out here.

839
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,840
"There are three."

840
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,220
What?

841
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,590
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:12,600
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

843
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,850
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:20,310
And your neighbours...

845
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:25,190
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,990
That was the TV. It's off now.

847
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:34,950
Can I just ask you one question?

848
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:38,370
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:43,500
When you said, "There are three"...

850
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,170
...what was the rest?

851
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:51,800
Look...

852
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,680
My husband and I just split up...

853
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:01,730
...and it's my first night in a new house...

854
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:05,320
...and I admit I was a little drunk.

855
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:10,070
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,780
...was going to be:

857
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,750
"There are three things that I'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

858
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:28,590
Thank God I came to my senses
before I said all that, and I hung up...

859
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,390
...so nobody would ever have to know
what I was thinking.

860
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:33,930
Unless, of course...

861
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:38,520
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,610
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,980
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,410
All right.

865
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,740
Ma'am...

866
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,040
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,790
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:11,300
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:14,800
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,140
Something like that.

871
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,310
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,120
Man...

873
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:39,370
...you guys are good.

874
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,790
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,300
They really train you guys.

876
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,720
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,520
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,690
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,420
This kid has seen my face.

880
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,250
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

881
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,420
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

882
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:33,670
You're on the hook, too.

883
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:37,800
Do one. Same price for the rest.

884
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,560
Stay the fuck away from me.

885
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,560
You know how this is going to end.

886
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,600
Goddamn!

887
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:43,600
What's up?

888
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,150
Why the hell didn't we do that?

889
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:08,450
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

890
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,500
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

891
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,090
Just let me drill, man.

892
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,860
Empty?

893
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,400
Come on, man.

894
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,230
Bank bonds.

895
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,520
One second.

896
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,730
Two, three, four, five...

897
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:45,320
Why are we doing this?

898
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,990
Because it's going to come to that.

899
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,660
There are 22.

900
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,750
22 million dollars.

901
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,580
That lying little shit!

902
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,750
Let's get out of here.

903
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,340
Lift.

904
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:21,440
Leave that. Christ, I'll buy you new tools.

905
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,650
You'll be okay.

906
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,420
It's glass. I got you. Come on.

907
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,300
Hurry up.

908
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,260
Watch the glass.

909
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,860
Get down here.

910
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,030
Wait.

911
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:04,240
Wait. You don't want to do that.

912
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:05,910
Dad, don't shoot him!

913
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:10,130
Let my daughter go.

914
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,630
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

915
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,880
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

916
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,050
Let her go.

917
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,390
Okay.

918
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:27,100
It's okay.

919
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,980
Let's go.

920
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,110
Let's go.

921
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,750
Just let her go. Let her go.

922
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,080
Let go of her!

923
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:50,960
Put that gun down.

924
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,000
-Sarah, come here.
-Put that gun down!

925
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:53,750
-Sarah, come here.
-Put that gun down!

926
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,670
-Do as I say.
-Don't be crazy, man.

927
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:59,170
-Just let her go.
-Let her go!

928
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,570
Are you okay?

929
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:22,530
-Did they hurt you?
-No.

930
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,660
-Did they touch you?
-No.

931
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,500
Stephan, shoot him. Shoot him!

932
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:35,400
Get off her!

933
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,730
You'll be okay now.

934
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:28,700
-Police!
-Don't move!

935
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:31,330
-Nobody move!
-Everybody on the ground!

936
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,080
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.

937
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,370
Are you okay?

938
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,380
Are you all right?

939
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:46,220
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

940
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,340
Don't move! I will kill you!

941
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,140
Move away from the wall!

942
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,220
Get off the fence! Move!

943
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,190
Put your hands in the air!

944
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,520
It'll be okay. It's fine, Dad.

945
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,820
Is there anybody else in the house?

946
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,150
No.

947
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:12,410
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.

948
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:22,000
It's okay. I'm all right.

949
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,550
I want to see the palms of your hands!

950
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:32,050
Do you hear me? Open your hands!

951
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:47,650
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.

952
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,900
Everything is going to be fine.

953
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:22,690
This sounds interesting.

954
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:25,230
"Two-bedroom with den or third bedroom...

955
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,820
"...new kitchen, original bath, 70s East."

956
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:32,240
I thought you liked the West Side.

957
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:35,950
"61st and Central Park West.

958
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:40,120

-"...conserg..."
-Concierge.

960
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,460
-What's that?
-It's French for "superintendent."

961
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,220
What's W.E.A. mean?

962
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:52,050
That's West End Avenue.

963
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:54,050
"81st and West End Avenue.

964
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:57,680

"...cathedral windows--"

966
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:01,060
Do we need all that space?

967
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:06,400
How about this?

968
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:09,610
"West 83rd, two-bedroom,

969

"...park block, partial views, bright and cheery,
high ceilings and wood floors."

970
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:20,091
Yeah, that one. I like the sound
of that one.
