00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,078
Many adults go into foster parenting

2
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:27,481
with the idea that love conquers all.

3
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,183
"They think," If I can
just love this child enough,

4
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,919
he or she will come around."

5
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:34,287
But this isn't always the case.

6
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:35,489
In this audiobook,

7
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,057
we will be dealing with how best to care

8
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:38,325
for a foster child

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,526
and guide you through the issues

10
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,727
you are likely to encounter

11
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,662
as a first-time foster parent.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:51,471
- You go get up on that hill.
- All right.

13
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:00,080
A good way to establish a
bond with your foster child

14
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:02,849
is during the ritual of the family meal.

15
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:47,928
Dude, did you catch me
throw that sick whip?

16
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,522
Whoo! Ha!

17
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:17,591
Did you just jump over a bathtub?

18
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,092
Yeah, man.

19
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,661
Damn, dude, that was insane...

20
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:24,731
Yeah, hey, post that shit on my channel.

21
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:34,474
A major challenge with teen children is,

22
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,409
sometimes they've been touched by trauma

23
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:39,980
they neither acknowledge nor
know how to talk to you about.

24
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,789
Tony, where the hell is that tractor?

25
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:25,325
What's up, Helen? Just
pushing a car off 90.

26
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,294
Why the hell does everything
take forever around here?

27
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,107
Small town, boss...

28
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,827
- I figured you would be used to it by now.
- Light a fire under his ass.

29
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,314
- I'm gonna get a smoke.
- Yeah, make it quick.

30
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,467
Hey, let me borrow your phone.

31
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,702
- Why?
- Just a quick call.

32
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,589
You figure out what this is about?

33
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,957
Is it drug-related?

34
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,458
All I know is, Stig's
got someone in the trunk,

35
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,859
and we're going off turf to make a kill.

36
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,062
- Who? Who's in the trunk?
- I don't know.

37
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,663
It's some job for hire.

38
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,193
What if they want me to kill him?

39
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,661
Don't. Sit tight.

40
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:34,896
- I'll track you.
- No.

41
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,097
I'm not on my phone.

42
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,632
We're at a gas station near Tivoli...

43
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,933
Grey four-door, Maine plates.

44
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:42,003
Chris.

45
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,771
You find a glory hole? Come on.

46
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,314
Thanks, kid.

47
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,190
Uh... ugh.

48
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,592
Only one.

49
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:05,593
Don't drop it.

50
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,963
Nice.

51
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,498
Oh, come on.

52
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,567
Are you kidding me?

53
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:14,102
Thanks.

54
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,503
Damn.

55
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,941
Hey, how many hits I get?

56
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,079
Uh, 22... In less than five minutes.

57
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,281
That's not bad, actually.

58
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:27,782
No, damn, that's good.

59
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:28,917
Any comments?

60
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:31,953
Rose says that you're "dope."

61
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,421
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

62
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,722
You know that kid Tommy at school?

63
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,424
He has a DSLR. I'm gonna borrow it.

64
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,592
The resolution on it is so sick.

65
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:38,860
It's so much better than this.

66
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,862
I mean, sponsors are
gonna flip out over this.

67
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,397
Really? It's that good?

68
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,598
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

69
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,832
I never had footage this good.

70
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:48,303
I mean, it's... here.

71
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,305
I mean, you're amazing.

72
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,806
I mean, you're awesome.

73
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,012
What the hell you doing?

74
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,348
Nothing. I'm not...

75
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,591
Okay.

76
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,160
So, uh...

77
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:15,263
So I... I got a ton of
air on those jumps, huh?

78
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,498
Yeah, but...

79
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:21,803
you know, those whips aren't easy.

80
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:25,506
I didn't say they were.

81
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,308
I thought you were into motocross.

82
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,484
No, I'm not, actually, so...

83
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,585
Hey, now... hey, hey.

84
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,721
Hey, sit down. Sit down.

85
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,752
Wait.

86
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,033
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

87
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,467
What if someone sees us?

88
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:28,903
Yeah, like a squirrel?

89
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:30,972
No one's gonna know about this,

90
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,740
because you're never gonna tell them.

91
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:04,806
Hey.

92
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:08,376
Are you kidding me? I'm not doing that.

93
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,912
Sorry, I just...

94
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:14,115
everyone in the city carries one.

95
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,683
You've done this before?

96
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,586
Yeah. It's okay.

97
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,888
It's okay. It's fine.

98
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,731
Shit, it's my dad.

99
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,307
Chris, trunk. Check the area.

100
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,408
Check the area for what?

101
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,745
Shut your mouth and do what I say.

102
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,246
These guys are gonna shoot you...

103
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,280
I've got a gun in my belt...

104
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:47,682
- ... you with me?
- Yeah.

105
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,756
Chris, get him out of the trunk.

106
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:57,859
Come on.

107
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:59,827
- Who are those guys?
- I don't know.

108
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,596
Want a hand, or what?

109
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:03,281
Get under the bed, now!

110
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,035
Come on.

111
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,040
Set him down.

112
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,258
Get the door.

113
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,695
This ain't right.

114
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,963
We got to figure this out, man.

115
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:19,981
What? Relax.

116
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,983
Damn it, Stig, this ain't right.

117
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:22,984
We can't be doing this.

118
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,218
Jesus, Chris, I'll do it.

119
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:25,803
Move!

120
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,783
Dude, it's cool, man, all right?

121
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,218
I'm with the FBI.

122
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,310
Please...

123
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,785
Damn it, come on.

124
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,153
We got to go. Let's go!

125
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,664
Dude, get the bike, go. Get the bike!

126
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,317
What are you doing?

127
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:49,353
Listen to me. We can't
say anything to anyone.

128
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,688
Are you kidding me?
He was gonna kill us.

129
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:51,923
Who would blame you for killing him?

130
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,725
You don't get it! I'm not gay like you!

131
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:57,495
No one even knows we talk, got it?

132
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:00,131
It's him!

133
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,671
- Is that... is that a deer?
- It's a deer.

134
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:12,410
- We got to tell Helen.
- Tell her what?

135
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:13,978
We were in the cabin, naked?

136
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,747
No! Never gonna happen.

137
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,784
Okay, well, I won't say anything.

138
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,027
He was gonna kill me. If
you hadn't stopped him...

139
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:34,699
If you hadn't...

140
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,822
Let your little inner chimpanzee out.

141
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,130
Come on, me and you. Right now.

142
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:08,042
- Good?
- Yeah, very good.

143
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,321
Mmm.

144
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,627
Philip's sleeping inside.

145
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,563
Yeah, that's the best
thing about having a kid.

146
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:29,964
You get to sneak around.

147
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:35,670
- I should make him breakfast.
- Come on.

148
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,438
We can pick something
up on the way to school.

149
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,840
No, I want to.

150
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,341
Meals are supposed to be the best time

151
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,410
to bond with your kids, right?

152
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,548
Sorry.

153
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:48,883
Me too.

154
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:54,022
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah?

155
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:55,323
Don't be mad.

156
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,158
He's probably just
trying to make friends,

157
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,994
but it looks like Philip
snuck out last night.

158
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,030
Well, they warned us
he might not be ready.

159
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,498
He's only been here for six weeks.

160
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,366
We all need time to get adjusted.

161
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:06,734
Went straight to voicemail.

162
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,137
Mm, 'cause he's in the city with her.

163
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,439
What, you're tracking Philip's phone?

164
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,275
That's probably not the best
way to establish trust, babe.

165
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,177
Yeah, well, maybe not, but
he's our responsibility,

166
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:17,178
so we'll get him.

167
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:18,913
Slow down. He's with his mother.

168
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:20,348
Exactly.

169
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,383
Why don't we just wait and see
if he catches the bus back...

170
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,785
- in time for school?
- Why?

171
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,054
The court said no
visitation till she's clean.

172
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:27,422
Yeah, but look.

173
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:28,823
We're offering him a better life.

174
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,426
We can't make him forget about his mom.

175
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,498
There's some dead guys in my cabin.

176
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:38,866
What?

177
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,034
Who? How many?

178
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,036
I don't know. I mean, it's a mess.

179
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:44,272
- They're all shot up.
- Really? Okay.

180
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,673
Um, I'll... I'll come check it out.

181
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:54,649
You be careful, babe.

182
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:56,017
Yes, I will.

183
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:57,718
I'll call Tony.

184
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,356
- And you get Philip.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,825
Thank you.

186
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,152
Philip, honey?

187
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:34,755
Honey. Hey.

188
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:39,627
Hey.

189
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:40,761
You can't be here.

190
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,263
- If the judge finds out...
- I'm done.

191
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,498
I can't go back.

192
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,099
I can't go back there.

193
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,534
It's okay.

194
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:48,536
I want to stay here with you, Mom.

195
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,841
Just a little... a
little bit longer, honey.

196
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,610
But I...

197
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:58,146
I'm getting better.

198
00:15:58,181 --> 00:15:59,814
I swear it, baby.

199
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,252
You always say that.

200
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:07,788
Honey...

201
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,957
this time it's real.

202
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:14,195
But if the court finds
out that you've been here,

203
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,964
then they're never
gonna let you come home.

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,499
I know.

205
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,605
Um, I brought you a little something.

206
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,313
A little gift from the boonies.

207
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,714
I love you.

208
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,383
Love you.

209
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:44,091
Is it, um...

210
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,426
Gabe and Helen?

211
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,262
Are they treating you good?

212
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,497
Yeah, they're treating me good.

213
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:50,665
It's not them.

214
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,646
Tell me nice things... about you.

215
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:09,217
School, love life...

216
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:11,385
What?

217
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,453
Oh.

218
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,122
Oh, my God, you got to tell me.

219
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:16,924
What's her name?

220
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,995
Lukas.

221
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:31,472
Does he know that you like him?

222
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:35,176
He knows.

223
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:38,913
But he wants to keep it a secret.

224
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,115
It's real ugly over there.

225
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,550
Nothing I want you to see.

226
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,118
So for now, the quarry...

227
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,987
I don't want you riding
over there anymore.

228
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,089
Okay, Dad.

229
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,357
You're good, though, right?

230
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:50,891
Yeah. Yeah, Dad.

231
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,382
Step aside, please.

232
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:18,486
Kamilah Davis... FBI.

233
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,064
So what do these guys have to do

234
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,399
with your investigation?

235
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:37,667
They're Vescovi's.

236
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:40,003
They were making a play
to distribute heroin.

237
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,042
Chris Petronelli.

238
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,245
Does that ring a bell?

239
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,646
No, these guys are foot soldiers,

240
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,081
so not our priority.

241
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,317
I'm gonna need to log that wallet.

242
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:01,086
You got much trouble with
the Vescovi's in Tivoli?

243
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:03,855
No, I just hand them speeding tickets

244
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,123
when they're passing through.

245
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:07,826
Well, you might want
to keep it that way.

246
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,128
Well, I'm gonna need to
question them about this.

247
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:13,798
- Nope.
- Vescovi ring's off limits.

248
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,034
And how am I supposed to
investigate in the meantime?

249
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,270
There's nothing to investigate.

250
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,676
You know how to set up a perimeter?

251
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,814
Thanks.

252
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:49,634
Hey.

253
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,070
It's Chris.

254
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:53,672
Kamilah...

255
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:56,174
Chris knew what he was getting into.

256
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,343
- Now we need to bury this.
- I know.

257
00:19:58,378 --> 00:19:59,678
The Bureau finds out that we let our

258
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,713
only informant get killed,

259
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:04,683
- I could get suspended.
- Oh, really?

260
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,217
Because if the Vescovi's find out...

261
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:08,119
that Chris was informing on them,

262
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,455
then my sister's dead.

263
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,391
- Look, asshole, social
services is gonna take my baby

264
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,594
unless I show 'em my
husband's pay stub by tomorrow.

265
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,128
I told you, Chris quit yesterday.

266
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,530
Rudy, slip two.

267
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,332
That's bullshit. I dropped him off.

268
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,600
A couple guys came to see him.

269
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,902
Next thing I know, he was gone.

270
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:24,903
- Hey.
- Hey!

271
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,372
- Were they Vescovi's?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,945
Hey.

273
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,780
- Hey!
- What?

274
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:37,816
Now you write me a pay
stub for Chris Petronelli

275
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:39,751
so I can keep a roof
over my kid's head.

276
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:41,920
- Do it.
- Okay.

277
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:59,638
Hey, you forgot this.

278
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:01,373
Uh...

279
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:06,578
- You okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,547
It was Anne's birthday.

281
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,049
Really?

282
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,350
Yeah, she's all alone,

283
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:13,618
you know, I didn't want to miss it.

284
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:15,654
Your mom always made such a big point

285
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,122
of telling me we're both Capricorns.

286
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:18,923
That's mostly in January.

287
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:24,129
She doesn't have anybody.

288
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,397
You guys got each other.

289
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:27,132
You don't really get it, you know...

290
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,566
I'm sorry, one second.

291
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:30,568
Sorry. Tony?

292
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:32,337
It's okay; it's just the way she is.

293
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:34,706
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:37,142
Okay.

295
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:39,377
Damn it, I have to go help
Tony with those three bodies.

296
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:42,547
Babe.

297
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:44,683
I'm sorry, Philip.

298
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,084
Um, what happened?

299
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,454
There was a shooting.

300
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:53,291
Um, where there, um... who died?

301
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:55,927
It was three gang members,
no one from around here.

302
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,796
Philip, you can't tell anyone anything

303
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:59,464
about Helen's work, okay?

304
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:03,568
What is it?

305
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,371
Nothing, it's just, um...

306
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:08,907
seeing a dead body sucks.

307
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:10,542
You've seen one before?

308
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:14,979
Uh, I got to go.

309
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:17,716
Bye, Philip.

310
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:24,622
So, Helen, are you okay?

311
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
You know, I was at the crime scene,

312
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:29,861
standing over the dead bodies,

313
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:32,063
and I...

314
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,799
I felt, for the first
time in a long time...

315
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:38,303
I don't know, since I moved here...

316
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:40,171
the sense of something...

317
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,107
of meaning and purpose,

318
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:45,076
and it just felt good.

319
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,285
Come on.

320
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:57,021
I didn't mean it like that.

321
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,256
Okay.

322
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,478
Hey, Philip, if you still
want to borrow my camera,

323
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:22,380
- I need some collateral.
- What?

324
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:23,648
I don't know, your jacket.

325
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,717
Oh, um, yeah.

326
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:28,086
- Cool, thanks.
- Okay, cool.

327
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,625
Hey, Helen said she found
three bodies in the cabin.

328
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,760
Wait, you told Helen?

329
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:37,395
Wait, what? No, no, no.

330
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,396
Listen to me.

331
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,265
There were four guys
in the cabin, right?

332
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,499
Yeah, so?

333
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:44,636
Yeah, so then why did Helen
only find three bodies?

334
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:47,605
Hey, who's your new friend?

335
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,706
Get out of here.

336
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,074
What if somebody survived?

337
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:52,944
Lukas,
listen to me, all right?

338
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:56,781
Okay.

339
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,653
Hey!

340
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,290
Okay, break it up!

341
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,558
Get off, bitch!

342
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,226
Get off! You're a goddamn freak!

343
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,628
Back! Back! Enough.

344
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,967
_

345
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,500
_

346
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:24,358
- Hey.
- Tony?

347
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:26,293
Big day, huh, Helen?

348
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:29,730
- Triple homicides and FBI...
- What is this?

349
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:30,898
It's our first murder board.

350
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,533
Uh, well, my first murder board.

351
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:33,634
I mean, you've...

352
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,002
You didn't have to do all this.

353
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:36,537
Hey, that's what partners do, right?

354
00:25:36,572 --> 00:25:38,806
What exactly are we partnering on?

355
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:39,907
The case.

356
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,876
I kind of figured that you
might need back-up out there.

357
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:43,110
Listen, don't get excited.

358
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:44,445
The FBI want me to back off.

359
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,248
They say that there's
nothing to investigate.

360
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,450
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,318
Damn, I went all the way to Red Hook...

362
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:52,787
to get these thumb tacks, too.

363
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:54,722
We have thumb tacks.

364
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:55,862
Yeah, but they're white.

365
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:57,130
I wanted a color code, see?

366
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,398
Look, I even put, like,
different colors...

367
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,734
- for each victim.
- Okay, partner.

368
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,035
Did you fill out the homicide report?

369
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,237
I'll have to co-sign.

370
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:07,040
Um, okay, I couldn't find those.

371
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:09,543
We've never had
a murder here before.

372
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:12,579
Here you go.

373
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,116
Uh, I have never looked
in this drawer before.

374
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:18,785
Okay, you know what?
You know what I think?

375
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:22,055
No, don't think until
you fill out that report.

376
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,725
I think that the FBI folks
think that we're small-time.

377
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,027
That's because we are. Stop.

378
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,228
Give me that pen.

379
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:33,233
Sign it again.

380
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:42,542
Chris Petronelli had
calluses on his left hand.

381
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:45,846
Yeah, maybe 'cause he did construction.

382
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:48,715
Yeah, or maybe 'cause
he was left-handed.

383
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,551
Will you go get me those
traffic citations...

384
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:54,121
from the back of my Jeep? Thank you.

385
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:55,856
- What's up, Philip?
- Hey.

386
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,591
Hi, Philip.

387
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:00,093
I heard what happened at school.

388
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,762
I just, uh...

389
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:03,230
just got into a little
thing with this kid.

390
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:04,831
It's... it's fine.

391
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,433
Yeah, you okay?

392
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:09,669
Yeah, um, you busy?

393
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:13,173
No. No, sorry...

394
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:16,076
You don't want to see that.

395
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:18,178
What's going on?

396
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,981
Uh, I just...

397
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:25,052
I just wanted to tell you that, um...

398
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:28,455
that I didn't mean to
lie to you and Gabe.

399
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,023
About your mom?

400
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,925
- Mm-hmm.
- I know it's tough,

401
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,761
but sometimes there
are rules for a reason.

402
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,496
So you gonna send me back?

403
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:37,964
One minute.

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,699
I'm sorry, what?

405
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:42,669
Nothing, I'm just... I'm kidding.

406
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,772
Mind if we talk about
this tonight at dinner?

407
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:47,507
I'll cook.

408
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,342
Make you whatever you want.

409
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:54,214
Mmm, I like Chinese takeout.

410
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:56,917
You got it.

411
00:27:58,487 --> 00:27:59,820
All right, what you got?

412
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,691
Shoot, this signature doesn't slant.

413
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,892
What you mean?

414
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,928
Well, I can't tell if he's left-handed.

415
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:09,529
Those guys are usually strapped.

416
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,831
I'm sure if Chris was left-handed,

417
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:11,932
he'd have a lefty holster.

418
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,333
Good call, Tony.

419
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,701
I'll go to his place... check it out.

420
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,840
Hey, uh, bad time, buddy...

421
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,007
Helen had to head out.

422
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:22,409
You, uh... you want a ride anywhere?

423
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:23,743
Back home or anything?

424
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:36,324
Chris, pick up the phone!

425
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:37,558
_

426
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,025
Pick up the phone.

427
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:40,460
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

428
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:42,796
Yeah. It's okay.

429
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,974
Sheriff Helen Torrance. Can
you open the door, please?

430
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:35,048
Is this the home of Chris Petronelli?

431
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,584
No.

432
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,421
Then all these people
got the wrong address too?

433
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,261
Very sorry for your loss.

434
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:49,663
If I could just come in for a minute,

435
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:50,730
I have a couple questions for you.

436
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,065
I don't know anything.

437
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Chris didn't mention any
plans the night he died?

438
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:55,368
Was he working for someone?

439
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:57,003
He's getting cold.

440
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,004
Is this... can I just ask,

441
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:01,609
is this Chris's hockey stick?

442
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:04,311
Was.

443
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,694
And he got pissed,

444
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,697
and he just started punching
me, so I had to defend myself.

445
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,933
- And, like, it wasn't...
- Doesn't matter who started it.

446
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:28,234
It doesn't matter, Philip.

447
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,473
It takes time to adjust to a new school.

448
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,763
And this isn't just new for you.

449
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:32,811
I mean, I've...

450
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:35,847
I've never done this
parenting thing before.

451
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,916
Why are you guys doing it now?

452
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:40,518
Well, Helen and I, uh,

453
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:42,320
wanted to give it a shot.

454
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,389
Together... a family.

455
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,828
You could have adopted...

456
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:53,431
like a cute, little,
chubby baby or something.

457
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:55,967
Gabe's family fostered teenagers...

458
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:58,236
when he was growing up.

459
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:01,906
And, um, did you still see them...

460
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,141
after they aged out?

461
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,076
I still see them now.

462
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:07,045
That's cool.

463
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,380
That's good.

464
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:12,116
Listen, Philip, I'm sorry I
left you in my office today.

465
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:13,651
But you more than made up for it.

466
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:16,054
You brought home Fang Chow.

467
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,056
Yeah, I did.

468
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:19,891
How many points do I get for that?

469
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:24,863
Um, food's hot... It's not burnt.

470
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,764
Excuse me?

471
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,467
I'd say it's a swish from half court.

472
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:31,636
Yeah, like Steve Kerr.

473
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,972
Uh, that was about 20 years ago, babe.

474
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:36,207
More like Steph Curry with the shot.

475
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:37,208
Okay.

476
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:38,510
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

477
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,111
I don't know who either
of those people are, so...

478
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,481
Sorry, guys. Hold on.

479
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:44,782
Yeah, Tony?

480
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,251
I found something on the surveillance

481
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:47,252
at the gas station.

482
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:49,254
That Vescovi guy, Chris...

483
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,055
Yeah, he was talking to some kid.

484
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,457
Looks like he borrowed his phone.

485
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:53,658
Great catch.

486
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,326
Find the kid, and get that number...

487
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,661
that Chris dialed for me that night.

488
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:57,862
Okay.

489
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:00,131
Wait, how did you think
to check the gas station?

490
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:03,468
It's the last place
to piss for 30 miles.

491
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:04,769
Thank you, Tony.

492
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:12,043
Well, that must've been important.

493
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:13,244
Sorry.

494
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:20,418
Philip, what were you gonna
tell me in my office earlier?

495
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,923
Um...

496
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:30,895
my mom... the judge...

497
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:33,598
He said that he might give us visits...

498
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,634
if she got into rehab.

499
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,770
You think she's ready for that?

500
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,538
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:43,474
Great. Let's work on it.

502
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:58,022
Mm. Wow.

503
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,924
That was really nice.

504
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,025
Mmm.

505
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:06,264
What time do we have to be there?

506
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,132
Oh, we got time.

507
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,978
Shit, he's back.

508
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,152
Nice.

509
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:34,993
Hey.

510
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:38,062
Come back to bed.

511
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:48,237
_

512
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:55,880
Hello, this is Kamilah.

513
00:33:55,915 --> 00:34:00,084
- Hello, Kamilah.
- Who gave you this number?

514
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,886
Hey, babe, remember we got our meeting

515
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,221
with Phil's principal this morning.

516
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:04,522
You want to ride together?

517
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:06,357
Nope, I just have to
stop by the station first.

518
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:08,192
I'll be right behind you.

519
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,496
Is that about the case?

520
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:14,265
No, I just have to
sign off on the budget,

521
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,633
but I'll see you there.

522
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,235
9:00.

523
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:24,275
Hello?

524
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,577
You know the old car wash on Route 9?

525
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,179
Yeah.

526
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:30,014
I'll see you there in an hour.

527
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,427
So what's to discuss?

528
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:43,628
Told you it was a one-off.

529
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,430
Yeah, you also told
me Chris Petronelli...

530
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:47,031
was a foot soldier you'd never met.

531
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,332
Yeah, that's right.

532
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:50,334
So you want to tell
me why he called you...

533
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,371
an hour before he was killed?

534
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,906
Someone walked away from that cabin.

535
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:56,708
Well, the FBI didn't
find any evidence of that.

536
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:59,243
Well, that's embarrassing,
because I did.

537
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,713
- Chris is a lefty.
- So?

538
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:03,448
So why is he holding his
gun in his righthand...

539
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:05,550
unless someone placed it there?

540
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:06,951
I think the killer is still out there.

541
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:08,653
If there is a killer out there,

542
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,288
are you gonna be the one to find him?

543
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,024
What is that supposed to mean?

544
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,525
Just figured you wouldn't
be up to the task...

545
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:15,893
you know, after Buffalo.

546
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,646
Dr. Caldwell?

547
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:51,596
Come on...

548
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,397
Sita, you pulled a gun on the foreman...

549
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:55,466
while you were holding your baby.

550
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:57,301
Don't! No, you can't take him!

551
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:59,604
No, please, don't! No, get off me!

552
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,410
No, no!

553
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:34,269
_

554
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:45,829
_

555
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,878
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,847
Oh, are you gonna hit me again, huh?

557
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:24,858
What the hell were you thinking

558
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:25,893
talking to me in front of everyone?

559
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,761
That doesn't matter anymore.

560
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,597
The guy... he was barefoot.

561
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,366
What?

562
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,700
One of the guys on the murder board...

563
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:34,701
he was barefoot.

564
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,737
That means he's dead.

565
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:38,772
Yeah, one of the other guys...

566
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,642
must've just lived and
then passed out, right?

567
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,077
Yeah, but the guy who saw us...

568
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:45,279
he's dead.

569
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:46,647
- He's dead?
- We're safe.

570
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,682
- We're safe.
- Yeah, we're safe.

571
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:56,623
No. I can't.

572
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:57,824
What?

573
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,297
I can't believe what's happening.

574
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,166
You're into me. That's what's happening.

575
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,634
Just deal with it.

576
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,304
No, no, no. No one knows.

577
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:17,778
So what if they do? Who cares?

578
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,880
I care.

579
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:21,248
You don't get it.

580
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:23,984
I don't... I don't want to be that guy.

581
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,186
And my dad... he doesn't
want me to be that guy.

582
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,722
And Rose...

583
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:31,191
No one wants me to be that guy.

584
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,392
What if you are?

585
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:36,964
You don't know me.

586
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,900
I know that you're just some...

587
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:43,337
some spoiled-ass rich kid.

588
00:38:43,372 --> 00:38:46,173
But you know everything
'cause your mom's a junkie?

589
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:51,845
Okay, you didn't have to say that.

590
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,416
Sorry.

591
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:57,985
Neither did you.

592
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:06,960
My dad's in Poughkeepsie tonight.

593
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,356
No. No.

594
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:37,357
- No, no, no, no.
- Huh?

595
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:38,358
- No!
- What?

596
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:40,227
No, no!

597
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:43,697
I'm not gonna be your little bitch.

598
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,033
- What?
- You got Rose for that.

599
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,668
You can't hit me in the face,

600
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:51,571
not want to be seen with
me like I'm some freak,

601
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,473
and then you want to fool around.

602
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:55,876
No, no.

603
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,979
No, you got to decide.

604
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,982
What's there to decide?

605
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,450
All right.

606
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:41,621
Flat.

607
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:51,686
