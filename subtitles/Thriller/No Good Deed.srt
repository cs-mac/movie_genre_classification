<i><font color="#ffff00">NEWSCASTER</font>: Colin Evans, convicted
of voluntary manslaughter</i>

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,681
<i>for one of the most brutal
murders in recent history,</i>

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,529
<i>is up for parole today.</i>

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,808
<i>Five years ago, Evans was one of</i>

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,724
<i>the most wanted men
in state history,</i>

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,121
<i>having emerged as
the prime suspect</i>

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,487
<i>in the disappearance
of five young women.</i>

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,611
<i>Evans was eventually
apprehended for the crimes,</i>

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,969
<i>only to escape and elude
authorities for several months,</i>

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,840
<i>until the night he was arrested
for the fatal barroom brawl</i>

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,321
<i>that would lead to
his manslaughter conviction.</i>

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,286
<i>The evidence necessary
to try Evans</i>

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,445
<i>for the abduction of the five
young women proved illusory.</i>

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,841
<i>The DA's office
decided to settle</i>

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,201
<i>for what it knew it could
prove in a court of law.</i>

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,002
<i>Hence, the lesser
manslaughter conviction.</i>

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,810
<i>No mention of Evans
being the primary suspect</i>

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,771
<i>in the disappearance and presumed
death of the five young women</i>

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,127
<i>was ever made at
his manslaughter trial.</i>

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,122
<i>But now, on a day when one
of the most feared men</i>

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,204
<i>in the annals of state
history might walk</i>

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,126
<i>after having served only five
years in prison for manslaughter,</i>

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,441
<i>the five families

<font color="#ffff00">DRIVER</font>: I'm hoping you get
a fair shake today, Colin.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,485
I prayed hard for it Sunday.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,925
I appreciate that.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,604
In my experience,

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,409
if you give a man
a second chance,

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,130
usually, they rise
to the occasion.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,645
Well, except politicians.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,722
I've never met one of them ever
learned from their mistakes.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,643
What about you, Officer Reid?

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,125
Can I count on your support?

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,409
They pay me to guard
you, not to talk to you.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,767
Don't mind him, Colin.
He's got woman troubles.

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,364
You know how that goes.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,281
Yeah.

<font color="#ffff00">COLIN</font>: Thank you, sir.

52
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,084
I'm not going to stand
here and lie to you,

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,401
because I'm not
very good at that.

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,408
When I was sentenced,
I was angry.

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,080
I told myself fights like this
get out of hand all the time.

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,166
Accidents happen
and I could have

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,049
easily been the man
that died that night.

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,608
But as time went by,
I realized I was wrong.

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,366
I shouldn't have been angry.

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,330
I should have been ashamed.

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,803
A man had died, and there was
no way I could bring him back.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,048
But I could make
a change within myself.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,124
And others, perhaps.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,646
I started a teaching program,

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,609
teaching other prisoners
to read and write.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,284
And the warden saw this,

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,921
and they're talking about taking my
program statewide to other prisons.

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,921
I feel like
that's an achievement.

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,811
I stand here right now
as a changed, humble man.

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,084
I've been in the prison correctional
system for five years now,

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,562
and that is exactly
what I am, corrected.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,163
Rehabilitated.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,488
I just want you to
give me a chance.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,571
I won't let you down.

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,160
Thank you for your time.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,406
Mr. Chairman, if I could
have just a moment?

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,244
<font color="#ffff00">CHAIRMAN</font>: Go ahead.

78
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,051
You see, I did my
homework on this man.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,287
And I can tell you
with confidence

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,170
that he's actually
quite a good liar.

81
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,888
<i>That fight that got out of hand,</i>

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,444
that was actually Mr. Evans
flying into a murderous rage

83
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,888
because of how the victim was
looking at his girlfriend.

84
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,123
And as a younger man, there
were other acts of violence,

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,090
frequently involving
the attentions of a woman.

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,450
Mr. Evans fits the criteria
of a malignant narcissist.

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,282
Charming, highly intelligent,
as you've witnessed,

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,201
but malignant narcissists are
compelled to prove their superiority.

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,364
Everything's a seduction,

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,405
and if they're rejected,

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,763
or things don't go their
way, they lose control.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,121

malignant narcissists were

Please sit down,
Mr. Evans.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,571
I can tell you there's
violence in this man.

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,690
And his control over
himself is slender.

100

make up their own minds,

101

five families outside

who are hoping and praying that
we do not set Colin Evans free.
