1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,334
I wanna come home,
Claire. Let me come home.

2
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,462
Please.
Just get out.

3
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,505
Get out!

4
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,846
Don't tell me Dad's not
coming back. Don't tell me that.

5
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,599
Kevin, wait. Kevin?

6
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,276
Claire.

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,028
I love you like a sister,
but you have got to

8
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:28,613
get those divorce
papers signed

9
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:29,989
and move on.

10
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:32,825
It's been nine months.

11
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,494
What? Are you having
second thoughts?

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,454
I'm having dinner.

13
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:37,872
With Garrett?

14
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,957
Oh, you pussy!

15
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,667
It's for Kevin's birthday.

16
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:45,171
Honestly, Vicky, sometimes I
think you're rooting against us.

17
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,297
Who's "us"?

18
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,757
You and me,
or you and him,

19
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,092
because I kinda
thought that was done.

20
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,511
He's the father of my kid.

21
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,387
Who cheats
with the secretary

22
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,515
every time he goes
to the home office.

23
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,933
Brings a whole new meaning

24
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,267
to "the San Francisco Treat. "

25
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,393
Not funny.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,313
He said she smelt like chocolate
chip cookies.

27
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:04,232
Goodbye. I'm just quoting his email.

28
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:07,276
You don't have to! Okay?

29
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:11,114
Because it's
burned in my mind.

30
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,532
Forever.

31
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:19,956
And for your information, he
doesn't go to San Francisco anymore.

32
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,752
So, stop bringing it up.
It's not fair.

33
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,546
Ta-da!
Make a wish.

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,755
Happy birthday!

35
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,633
You made that?
Of course!

36
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,343
Come on. I've been
waiting all day.

37
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:33,719
I want you to see this.

38
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,514
Okay.
I'll help you.

39
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:37,974
One, two, three!

40
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,934
Ta-da!

41
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,728
Oh, my God! Dad!
Huh?

42
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,021
It's like a high-powered

43
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,607
gaming tower
with an arctic cooler.

44
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:47,692
And you made this?

45
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,902
Three weekends in a row.
Triple processor.

46
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:52,155
Dad, thank you so much.

47
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,906
Let's do cake.

48
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,119
What are you guys
doing for Labor Day?

49
00:02:58,203 --> 00:02:59,745
I don't know. Why?

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,664
I thought we'd go camping
like the old days.

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,000
Mom, too? GARRETT: Yeah, of
course. That's what I was thinking.

52
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,793
Oh, it will be a lot of fun.
We could catch fish,

53
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,086
and, Mom,
you could cook it.

54
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,504
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

55
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,922
Please?

56
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,341
Look at you, you got schmutz
everywhere. Go clean up.

57
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,719
Okay. All right,
be right back.

58
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,429
Come on, what do you say?

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,805
Um...

60
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:20,808
When were you
thinking of going?

61
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,560
I get back from
a business trip

62
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:24,103
the Thursday
before Labor Day.

63
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,771
Business trip?

64
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,273
Yep. Get back
Thursday night,

65
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,482
we'll leave, three days.

66
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,609
Where?

67
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,778
That old cabin we used
to go to at Mammoth Lakes.

68
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:33,863
That sounds great!

69
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:38,159
No, I meant where
is your business trip?

70
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:42,288
Let me guess. San Francisco?

71
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,373
It's work.
It's not what you think.

72
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,000
Does she still work there?

73
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,668
Claire, it doesn't matter.

74
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:49,462
No, I guess
it doesn't matter.

75
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:51,881
Mom?
Yeah?

76
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,382
So, you coming or not?

77
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,634
Mmm. You know what?

78
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,136
That's the weekend
before school starts.

79
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,765
So, you know, you guys should
just keep it a guy trip.

80
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,226
You'll have a blast.

81
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,769
Okay.
Okay.

82
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,342
Kevin!
Honey, we gotta go.

83
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,303
Kevin!

84
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,721
I know.

85
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,850
Mom, the door is jammed.

86
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,560
Mom, look,
can we just forget it?

87
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,896
Because I don't wanna
see another doctor, okay?

88
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:50,648
He's not gonna tell you
anything any different.

89
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:53,025
He is the best allergist
in the Valley, okay?

90
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,277
We're going.
You know what?

91
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,487
I'll lift the door,
you pull the cord.

92
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,532
Okay. Okay.

93
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,660
Okay, you ready, Mom?

94
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,705
Just pull it up! It's
too heavy.

95
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,248
It's too heavy.
Pull it up, baby.

96
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:09,000
I got it.

97
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,503
I can fix that
for you if you want.

98
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,131
And you are?

99
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,049
My nephew.

100
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,759
Oh, hey, Mr. Sandborn.

101
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,804
Noah. I'm staying
next door with my uncle.

102
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,972
Claire.

103
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,640
He's here to help me

104
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,310
when I get the, uh,
bone marrow transport.

105
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,436
Right.

106
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,438
"Transplant," Uncle Bob.
"Transplant. "

107
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:31,647
Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,066
He's got a real knack
for fixing things.

109
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:36,152
I can, uh, take a
look at this real quick.

110
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,903
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Noah.

111
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,613
Kevin. Yeah. Um...

112
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,240
I don't know
what the issue is.

113
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,075
It might be
off the track, but...

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,994
Nah. Actually,
it's the clutch.

115
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,330
We can get another one at the
hardware store if you want.

116
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,581
You wanna go? Come on.

117
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,625
Well, you know, we actually
had somewhere to be,

118
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,003
but now that
we're gonna be late...

119
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,087
Mom?

120
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,299
Okay.

121
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,884
Go ahead.
Cool.

122
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,136
All right. It was nice
meeting you. You, too.

123
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
Uncle Bob?
Are you gonna be okay?

124
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,680
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.

125
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,098
Look at me.

126
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,559
Hey. Love you.
Love you, too.

127
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,770
His parents died last year.

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,273
I'm all he's got now
in the way of family.

129
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:16,776
He seems like a nice boy.

130
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,277
Yeah, he is.

131
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,863
You up for some coffee?

132
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,740
Yeah, sure. Sure.
Come on.

133
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,618
So, the entire time,
it was the clutch.

134
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:26,786
Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,954
How old are you,
anyway?

136
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,623
Almost 20.

137
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:31,874
But you're not
from around here.

138
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,085
No. San Bernardino.

139
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,088
My uncle, actually,
my great-uncle, uh,

140
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,964
he needed help,
I needed a change,

141
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:41,425
so I figured I'd go
back to school here.

142
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,927
You mean college?

143
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,346
There was this, uh...

144
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,639
Accident.

145
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,474
So, I lost some time.

146
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,226
So, I'm gonna finish up
at Monroe High.

147
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,396
That's where I go. My mom
teaches there, actually.

148
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,649
She seems way too cool
to be a teacher.

149
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:57,775
She is cool.

150
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,110
For a mom.

151
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,905
Okay. We got everything.

152
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,740
Good to go?
Yeah, let's go.

153
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,200
Okay.

154
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:07,618
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

155
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,204
Whoa.

156
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,498
Can you, uh, pay for this?

157
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,500
What?
Uh...

158
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,419
Look,
that's Allie Callahan, okay?

159
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,462
She's the most
beautiful girl in school

160
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,965
and I just can't think when I'm
around her. So, just, can you...

161
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,508
I don't know.
I hate to tell you this,

162
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,176
but she's already seen you.

163
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,469
Just go on
and talk to her.

164
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,595
And say what?

165
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,099
Just tell her,

166
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,601
"Here are some garage parts. How much?"

167
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,603
Go!
Wow. Very funny. Yeah.

168
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,813
Come on.
Thank you.

169
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,149
You want me to fail.

170
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,194
Hi.
Hi, Kevin.

171
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,780
Hi, Allie. Um, I didn't
know you worked here.

172
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,657
My dad's making
my brother and me

173
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:49,034
do split shifts
to earn gas money.

174
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,494
It could be worse.

175
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,538
If you didn't have a brother,
you'd be working full time.

176
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:53,873
Noah Sandborn.

177
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,791
Allie. Nice to meet you.

178
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,959
Nice to meet you, too.

179
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,461
I'm friends
with Kevin here.

180
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,212
I'm gonna go look around.

181
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,505
Okay, sure.

182
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,508
So, you're having
a good day?

183
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:05,718
Yeah.
Great.

184
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,470
How about you?
Actually...

185
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,725
Hey, check it out.

186
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,394
Look who it is! Whiz!

187
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,645
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

188
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,813
Okay, okay!

189
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,982
Jason! Guys!
Did you pee-pee?

190
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,609
Oh, what is this, huh? Come on.

191
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:22,902
Is this your EpiPen?

192
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,528
Your little
penis purse?

193
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:27,072
You guys, stop it!
Get out of the store!

194
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,991
The kid still pisses the bed.
All three of you, get out!

195
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,452
Okay, all right,
fine, fine.

196
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,413
See you later, Whizzy. Stay away
from liquids.

197
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,458
Hey, Noah,
are you ready to go?

198
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:40,836
Uh, Allie, how much
is this gonna be?

199
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,796
I'll ring it up.

200
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,716
Clutch is in.
We're all good.

201
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,218
You thirsty?

202
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,345
Yeah.

203
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,223
Thanks for fixing the door.
And for including him.

204
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,559
Hey, there was this kid
at the hardware store

205
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,186
giving him a hard time.

206
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,812
Jason Zimmer?

207
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,358
Um, skater kid, red hair,

208
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,609
permanently dumb look
on his face?

209
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,279
That would be the one. Kept
on calling him "The Whiz. "

210
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,327
He actually had an incident

211
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,037
a couple of years ago
on a playground

212
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,541
where he got stung by a bee,
and his throat swelled up

213
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,210
and he panicked

214
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,295
and lost control.

215
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,838
Whiz.
Whiz.

216
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,340
Oh, man.

217
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,635
Kids can be cruel. Especially
kids like Jason Zimmer.

218
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,305
But, please,
don't tell him I told you.

219
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,473
He'd be mortified.

220
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,184
You can trust me.

221
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,565
Anyways, uh, you're all set.

222
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:47,736
This is very exciting. Very
exciting moment.

223
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,825
It works!

224
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,579
Thank you.

225
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,791
I'm gonna take off
this cover real quick.

226
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,877
Put it over there.
On the ground?

227
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,670
Uh, wherever. Just set
it down, doesn't matter.

228
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:47,796
Set it down?
Yeah.

229
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,506
All right, now this
bad boy right here

230
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,175
is the alternator.
You know what this does?

231
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,052
No.
It charges the battery.

232
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,595
So, I'm gonna
do one piece of it,

233
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,388
you're gonna do the other,
all right? All right.

234
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,015
All right?
Yeah.

235
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,644
You're actually
going the opposite way.

236
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,728
Yeah.

237
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:03,937
All right, we're gonna
check out the alternator.

238
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,440
You're loosening it up
rather than tightening it.

239
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,276
How's that?

240
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,613
It's in there. You wanna
finish it off, Noah?

241
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,198
I'll just do it in there.

242
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,659
Okay.

243
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,871
Yeah, this one
needs two...

244
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,833
Make sure it's
actually in there.

245
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,418
To the right?

246
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,861
Okay,
I'm changing the subject.

247
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,031
Um, how long will your
uncle be in the hospital?

248
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,616
Um, I don't know.

249
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:00,244
It's all about
the transplant taking.

250
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,539
Well, until he's better, you
can come over for dinner here

251
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,957
anytime, okay?

252
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,750
I don't want you eating
by yourself. I mean it.

253
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,752
Thanks, but I don't
wanna impose.

254
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh, I do. Especially if
she's making the guacamole.

255
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,382
You are not an imposition.

256
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,883
Are you saying I am?
Mmm.

257
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,510
Well, in that case,
I wouldn't mind

258
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:17,803
imposing on your
literature class.

259
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,056
Oh, no, dude,
you don't wanna do that.

260
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,391
They call her
"The Crusher. "

261
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,684
Is that what they call me?

262
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:24,768
Yes.
Yeah.

263
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,186
You know what? Carry
your own plate.

264
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,479
Clean up all the dishes.

265
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,358
Now he's really
worried about it.

266
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,611
Strange kid.

267
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:35,904
Why?

268
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,990
Can't put my finger on it.

269
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,408
Don't try so hard.

270
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,162
Okay. He's interested
in literature?

271
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:46,915
In the classics.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,501
Back in San Bernardino,
we were studying the Odyssey.

273
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,670
You want me to help
you out with that?

274
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,922
Sure. Here you go.

275
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,758
You know, I'm teaching
Homer next semester.

276
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,134
Really? He's my favorite.

277
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,469
You're kidding, right?

278
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,179
Second that.

279
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,097
Dude, you gotta
read the lliad.

280
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,558
Achilles is this
total badass.

281
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,934
Hot-tempered, full of pride,

282
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,061
completely consumed
by his emotions.

283
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,396
You know what he
called Agamemnon?

284
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,564
Who?

285
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,150
"A pitiful excuse
for a king. "

286
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,861
To his face.

287
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,529
He killed this guy, Hector.

288
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:18,906
But instead of hiding out
like a pussy, he...

289
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,200
Dragged his dead body around
for everybody to see.

290
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,702
Yes! He stood by his
actions, right or wrong.

291
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,538
Well, because to him
they were justified.

292
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,207
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

293
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,000
No.
No.

294
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,088
Homer's a genius,
my man.

295
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:39,218
Just like Shakespeare,
Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan.

296
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,469
Ugh.

297
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,336
Poets.

298
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,239
I'll have him
back Sunday afternoon!

299
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:02,115
Bye, Mom, I love you!

300
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,681
Oh, hey, Noah,
come on in.

301
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,349
You know,
Kevin already left.

302
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,686
Actually, I, uh, picked
something up for you.

303
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,528
Oh, my God,
this is a first edition?

304
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,155
I can't accept this, this
must have cost a fortune!

305
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,033
It was a buck at a garage
sale. One man's trash...

306
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:49,371
Noah, I can't.
Honestly...

307
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,455
Claire, please!

308
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,165
I've been eating here
every single night.

309
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,625
It would mean a lot to me.

310
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,464
Thank you.

311
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,429
Those yours?
Oh, no.

312
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,681
They were a gift from Vicky. Good.

313
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,516
Why?

314
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,228
Those kind of shoes are
for women trying to be sexy.

315
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,480
You don't need to try.

316
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,194
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have, uh...

317
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,614
No. No, it's okay.

318
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,827
Where are you?

319
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,161
Almost there.

320
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,496
Well, hurry up!

321
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,664
Vicky, I can't do this!

322
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,124
I haven't had a date
in 18 years,

323
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,126
I don't even know
what to do anymore!

324
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:01,712
Three yhings.
One, laugh a lot.

325
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,880
Two, take off
your wedding ring.

326
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,841
Three, give him head.
What?

327
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,301
Kidding!
Just get here, pronto!

328
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,182
And yhe closer
I get to this car,

329
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,768
the smell is getting stronger
and stronger.

330
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,062
And I walk up to
the guy's window,

331
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,522
rolls down the window,

332
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,191
I look and on
the passenger seat is

333
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,651
his dead dog!

334
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,278
You did not tell me that.

335
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,698
So, Ethan tells me you teach.

336
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,866
English, is it?

337
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,201
The classics.
Wow.

338
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:34,911
What does that mean?

339
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,539
Oh. No, he just
means as a compliment,

340
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,541
like, "Wow, you teach
the classics. "

341
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:43,086
It's fancy.

342
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:45,172
I mean, I don't know

343
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:46,673
how many kids nowadays
are going to use

344
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:49,092
what they learn
from classics.

345
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,636
No offense.

346
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,014
Oh, none taken.
I am a vice principal

347
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,974
and I just want to see
these kids employed.

348
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,225
Shall we order?

349
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,728
Silly me,
I just want them educated.

350
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:01,480
I'm fine with education,

351
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,440
but we gotta
get them working.

352
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:06,777
Practical skills.
That's where the money is.

353
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,489
Ah! Money!
That's the goal, then.

354
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,157
Oh. Ethan,
how's your mom?

355
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,575
Gallstones.

356
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,494
Oh, gallstones.
Mm-hmm.

357
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:17,579
Are those the ones you
pass? Or are those the other stones?

358
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,872
Yeah,
she's getting better.

359
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:22,000
You know, money's fine, except
when it's motivated by greed.

360
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,421
You're a little firecracker when
you get riled up, aren't you?

361
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,714
I think it stopped raining.

362
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,174
Firecracker?

363
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,551
Is that how you regard
women with an opinion?

364
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,179
Only when they
disagree with mine.

365
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,937
Pleasure to meet you, Benny.

366
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,688
No, Claire,
stay, stay!

367
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,653
J. K. Rowling.

368
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:51,029
I'm sorry?

369
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,280
Billionaire.

370
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,907
Classics major.

371
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,953
She's a lot of laughs.

372
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,206
You gotta get to know her.

373
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,350
Hello?
Quesyion.

374
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:06,730
I tried to defrost
a chicken in the microwave.

375
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,566
And some of it's
kind of cooked,

376
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,359
some of it's kind of not.

377
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,569
Do you think
it's still cool to

378
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:14,321
eat the cooked part?

379
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:16,990
No! Do not eat that!

380
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:19,868
Then, please, come over
and bail me out. Um...

381
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:21,912
Um... Uh...

382
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,039
Okay.

383
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,874
Perfect. Okay.

384
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,167
Yes.

385
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:28,418
See you soon.

386
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,086
Okay.

387
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:40,639
I mean,
that date was awful.

388
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,350
Like that chicken.

389
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,560
I'm sorry I couldn't salvage
it more, but... You did fine.

390
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,770
The damage was done.

391
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:49,814
Yeah. I'm glad
I had you next door.

392
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,903
What?

393
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,325
God, you're beautiful.
You know that?

394
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:02,285
Oh, no, I'm...

395
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,162
Amazing.

396
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,291
And sweet,
natural and sexy.

397
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:12,837
So sexy.

398
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,381
Noah!

399
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,258
Kiss me, Claire.
Just...

400
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,343
I can't.
Just once.

401
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,804
Please.
I have to go.

402
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:24,015
Tonight, in the window...

403
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,685
You were watching me.

404
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,021
I can't do this!

405
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:32,607
Noah!

406
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,276
I want to watch you now.

407
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,195
This can't happen.
We can't.

408
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,530
It's wrong!

409
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:45,704
It doesn't feel wrong,
does it?

410
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,297
Wait.
It feels so...

411
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,215
Oh, my God, stop.

412
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,550
...nice.

413
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,056
Soft.

414
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,726
Please, please stop.

415
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:17,152
Noah, please!

416
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:18,903
Stop.

417
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,325
No judgments.

418
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:27,912
No rules.

419
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,334
Just us.

420
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,918
Oh, my God.

421
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:36,212
A woman like you

422
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:38,006
should be cherished.

423
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,758
Loved.

424
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,180
Let me love you, Claire.

425
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,820
You are perfect

426
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,531
in every way.

427
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,813
Oh, my God!

428
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,994
Hey! Where are you going?

429
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:14,579
Home.

430
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:16,372
I gotta get home.

431
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:17,582
No, you don't.

432
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,918
Kevin doesn't get home till
later. Have some coffee.

433
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,127
I can't. This...

434
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:22,504
Was incredible.

435
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,344
Hey, you're having second
thoughts, it's normal.

436
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,012
This isn't normal, okay?

437
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,515
Nothing about this
is normal.

438
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,974
Where's my coat?

439
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,186
Would you just stop
for one minute?

440
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,396
Look, Noah,
I don't want you to think

441
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:42,106
that any of this
was your fault, okay?

442
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,858
I'm the adult, I'm the
one that should've known...

443
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:47,195
Stop, stop! Just stop!

444
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,863
What we did wasn't wrong.
No matter what you say,

445
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,114
it wasn't wrong!

446
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,950
I wasn't thinking
clearly, okay?

447
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,744
I got swept up in the
moment. I was vulnerable

448
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:57,956
and you're very sweet.
No.

449
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,291
And it was flattering, but I... No.

450
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:02,544
It was more than that.

451
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,467
God damn it!

452
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,809
Noah, look,

453
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,519
it wasn't more
than that, okay.

454
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:21,062
I was feeling vulnerable.

455
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,357
How can you say that?
Last night was so perfect.

456
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:26,442
Because it's true.

457
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:28,319
And in time, you're
going to see it, too.

458
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,119
Just leave.

459
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,329
Are you okay?
Go!

460
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,480
Mom, we caught seven trout.

461
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,691
Wow!

462
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:10,278
Yeah, he was, uh,
pretty amazing.

463
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,113
Uh, Mom, can Dad
stay for dinner?

464
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,866
Um...
Please?

465
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,409
Dad?

466
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,372
Please?
Sure.

467
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,794
I saw this video
on YouTube,

468
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,963
where this, just like,
big, you know, mountain dude

469
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,633
who lives all alone in
this old shack in Montana.

470
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,217
And he cooks all
his food on a shovel.

471
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,762
No, you didn't.
We did.

472
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:38,264
I mean, we wrap it up
in tinfoil first...

473
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:39,724
And eat off the shovel?

474
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,726
Yeah, well, the
foil-covered shovel.

475
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,645
It was a great meal.
It was delicious.

476
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,647
Yeah, it was, like, one of
the best meals I've ever had.

477
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:46,981
Oh! Thank you!

478
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,149
No. No offense, Mom.

479
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,402
You know what I mean.
I don't mean it like that.

480
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,404
This was great.

481
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,866
What do you
think she made?

482
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,201
I bet you it's cookies.

483
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,800
I'll get it.

484
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,051
You want any coffee?

485
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:16,594
Yeah,
I'll have some if you are!

486
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,764
Noah! What's up?

487
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:20,848
Hey, man,
you're back.

488
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,141
How was the trip?

489
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,519
Hey, Dad,
this is, uh, Noah.

490
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:25,937
Remember, I've been
talking about him a lot?

491
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,313
Hey, nice to meet you!

492
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,691
I feel like I know you,
he talks about you so much.

493
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,860
Told me about the alternator
you put in the truck.

494
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,238
Oh, actually,
Kevin helped out, too, so...

495
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,531
Yeah?
Yeah, I did.

496
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,657
Yeah. It was so cool.

497
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:38,991
I had no idea
you could do that yourself.

498
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:40,118
That's what
friends are for.

499
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:41,202
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

500
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,453
Hey, Noah.

501
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:43,579
Wow, looks perfect.

502
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:45,081
You tell them what
happened this weekend?

503
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,250
What happened?

504
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,293
Oh, there was a big
thunderstorm up here.

505
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:50,795
You guys didn't
get it up there?

506
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:52,839
No, beautiful,
dry as a bone at the lake.

507
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:54,966
Well, it got
pretty wet here.

508
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:56,092
Wow.

509
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,679
You know what, big day
tomorrow. First day of school.

510
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:00,930
It's getting kind of late.

511
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:02,098
But it's, like, 8:30.

512
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:04,809
No, no, no. Actually, I gotta get
going. It's a big day tomorrow.

513
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,894
I'll walk out with you,
Mr. Peterson.

514
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,688
Oh, I'm going to stay
around awhile, thanks.

515
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:10,189
Well, you know, I'll
walk out with you, Noah.

516
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,275
Yeah, come on.

517
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,235
Uh, do you want to take
a cookie for the road?

518
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,653
I love your
mother's cookies.

519
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:16,738
They're great, right?

520
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,198
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. You, too, pal.

521
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:24,495
Nice kid.

522
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,421
You know, we need
to figure out

523
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,631
what we're doing here,
Garrett.

524
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,008
What do you mean?

525
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:42,096
I mean, we're in limbo here

526
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,516
and maybe, you know,
it's just time to move on.

527
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:46,976
I'm not seeing her
anymore.

528
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,604
But you might as well be, because
I'm always going to think you are

529
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,147
and I don't want
to live that way.

530
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:53,065
And you shouldn't want
to live that way, either.

531
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,777
Hey, it wasn't about her.
It was about us.

532
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,696
Okay? We were broken.

533
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,365
We both checked out.

534
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,743
I'm not saying what I
did was right, it wasn't.

535
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,119
It was...

536
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,121
It was stupid.

537
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:10,166
Smart people do dumb
things. They make mistakes.

538
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,252
Haven't you ever
made a mistake?

539
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,630
Don't throw
our marriage away

540
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,173
because I made a mistake.

541
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,510
Don't file. Not yet.

542
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,473
Just take...
Take some time.

543
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,898
All right.

544
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:37,985
Come on.

545
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,178
Welcome, everybody,

546
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,930
to the start of
a brand-new year.

547
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:08,683
This year,
we are studying

548
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,686
Homer's lliad
and its themes.

549
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:14,897
The first one we'll be studying
is the wrath of Achilles.

550
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:16,899
Mrs. Peterson.

551
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:20,403
Principal Warren,
what a nice surprise.

552
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,988
Good news.
I've approved your request

553
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,948
for Noah Sandborn
to join your class.

554
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,372
"No man or woman born,
coward or brave,

555
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,583
"can shun his destiny!"

556
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,962
I think it was Achilles
who said that, right?

557
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,633
Wait!

558
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:44,969
Ed?

559
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:46,554
Wait!

560
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,222
Wait a second.

561
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,850
This is a class
for AP juniors,

562
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:53,144
Noah Sandborn
is a transfer senior, so...

563
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:55,479
I'm confused.

564
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,440
Your transfer request
said, yeah,

565
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:59,358
that he'd be an asset
to the class.

566
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,740
This was your email.

567
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,117
That's right. Thank you.

568
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,578
Have a great year.

569
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,443
Hey!

570
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,528
Stop following me!

571
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:46,614
I'm not following you, Claire.

572
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,907
I live next door.

573
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,967
Kevin!

574
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,343
Yeah?

575
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:09,553
Did you send an email
from my account

576
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:10,972
to Principal Warren?

577
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:13,557
No, why?

578
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,435
Because somebody did.

579
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,941
It sounds like
you've been hacked.

580
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,734
You should really
change your password.

581
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,736
You know, I'd be happy to help
you out with that, if you want.

582
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:27,113
No, thanks.

583
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,324
Hey, you ready to go?

584
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,617
Yeah!

585
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:33,411
Kevin!

586
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:36,664
Noah, can you give us
a second, please?

587
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,460
You can wait
for him outside.

588
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,838
Yeah, I'll be
down in a minute.

589
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,047
Oh, sure, yeah.

590
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,384
Mom, that was really rude.
Why'd you do that?

591
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:49,927
He's here way too much.

592
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:51,220
You're the one who
told him he could be

593
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,513
and he's coming
to dinner tonight.

594
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,682
No, your dad's
coming to dinner tonight.

595
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,100
So, why can't
he come, too?

596
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:58,936
I want it to just be
the three of us, okay?

597
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,231
Okay, yeah.
Okay.

598
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,151
All right.
I'll see you later, then.

599
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,406
My Uncle Bob was
a tail gunner in Korea,

600
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,825
and a sergeant in Vietnam.

601
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,785
Tough old dude.

602
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,788
Now he's laying
in Valley Memorial,

603
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,291
hoping the transplant takes.

604
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,418
Here, you got that?

605
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:23,919
Thanks.

606
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,051
Your dad seems to be
around a lot now, huh?

607
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:31,927
Yeah, I guess.

608
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,474
Like a dinner
and a camping trip

609
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:38,476
can just make you forget
about how he walked out on you.

610
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,107
Yeah, it's so predictable.

611
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:46,525
A guy hits middle age,

612
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,611
and suddenly
staring death in the face.

613
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:49,987
You know,
tire around the waist,

614
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,155
hair in the drain,

615
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,740
cock that just
won't stand up anymore.

616
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,033
He wants to
feel alive again.

617
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,159
He wants to
feel that rush,

618
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:57,661
you know, he felt
when he was our age.

619
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:03,000
So, he picks up
a younger woman and poof!

620
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,128
Whole new life.

621
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:09,673
Go ahead and aim.

622
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:18,891
Almost.
Little better, right?

623
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:20,976
Yeah. Here,
switch with me real quick.

624
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,897
Then the guilt sets in.

625
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,733
Because he basically just
left the first kid in the dust.

626
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,902
So, he tries to bribe him.

627
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,071
With things.

628
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,283
Like computers.

629
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,127
Wow.

630
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,964
You follow me?

631
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,469
So, what's up?
How's school?

632
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,680
It is what it is.

633
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,598
Tell him about
your computer class.

634
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,809
He's learning how to
write his own software.

635
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,144
Like father, like son.

636
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:06,230
That's cool. We can
do some stuff together.

637
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,692
I dropped it.
What?

638
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,903
I dropped it.
It was boring.

639
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,865
Going out for boxing now.

640
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,576
You're going out for boxing?
You don't like boxing!

641
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,329
How would you know?

642
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,415
Seriously, how would you know
what I like and what I don't like?

643
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:25,666
Am I missing something here?

644
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,876
Yeah!

645
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,919
Okay. You've been missing it
for nine months, Dad!

646
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,337
You just can't
come back in here

647
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,964
and expect to pick up,
like nothing happened!

648
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,465
All right, Kevin,
that's enough!

649
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,968
No! Mom, he's gotta
hear this! Okay.

650
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,970
Life's been happening, Dad.

651
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:42,683
You know what, Mom,
I got homework to do.

652
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,936
Kevin, wait. At least
finish your dinner!

653
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,855
Let him go.

654
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,273
He just probably
needs some space.

655
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,411
Here we go.
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,041
Hey, uh, how was
dinner with your dad?

657
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,669
Let's just take a break,
all right?

658
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:12,671
No, keep going!

659
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:14,340
Come on, talk to me.
Dinner?

660
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:18,594
God, I was a jerk, okay?

661
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,846
I feel really bad about it.

662
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:23,057
No! No! Dude, that's good.

663
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,059
It means he knows
you're onto his bullshit.

664
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,937
We just have to hope that
your mom doesn't fall for it.

665
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,939
Can't let her, uh,
be his meantime girl.

666
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,358
What's that?

667
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,693
You know, someone he
screws in the meantime.

668
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,656
Hey, uh, come on.

669
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,325
Someone he screws
in the meantime?

670
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,454
Yeah. Put your body
into it, there we go!

671
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:47,331
Kev! Take it easy, Kev!

672
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:48,874
Calm down!

673
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,460
Easy, easy! Kev!

674
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,170
Hey! Hey! Hey!

675
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,755
Kev! Kev!

676
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:56,966
What do I do?
What do I do?

677
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:58,384
God damn it!

678
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,849
Where's your pen?
Where's your pen?

679
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:12,690
Shit!

680
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:18,779
Kev. Kev, I got it!
What do I do with it?

681
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,114
Oh, my God!

682
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,950
Where do I put this?

683
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:24,785
Shove it in the leg!

684
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,874
Is it working?

685
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,796
You good?

686
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,131
Oh, my...

687
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,717
Are you all right?

688
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,510
Oh, my God.

689
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,432
You're not dying
on me today, okay.

690
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,475
God! Get over here!

691
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,366
Garrett's coming on
a little strong,

692
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,076
don't you think?

693
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,078
What makes you think they're
from Garrett?

694
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,416
Did you read my card?

695
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,126
Would I read your card?

696
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,593
"Please give me
another chance. "

697
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,387
What? It's a thin envelope.

698
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:26,638
Ugh.

699
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,099
Tell me you're not going to.

700
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:30,934
I'm thinking about it.

701
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,520
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Oh, I know! I know.

702
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,938
Let's tell him
to take his cookies

703
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,231
and shove 'em
right up his ass.

704
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:38,901
You know what? Enough
with the cookie jokes.

705
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:41,487
We've all done things in our lives
that we wish we wouldn't have.

706
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:44,740
You know what?
Maybe you should start

707
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:46,575
worrying about yourself
for a change.

708
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,203
It's way more fun
worrying about you.

709
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,664
Make him grovel
just a little bit, I swear...

710
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,249
Hey!
Hey!

711
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:56,335
Um...

712
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,629
Uh, did I catch you
at a bad time?

713
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:01,048
No, never. They're beautiful, Garrett.

714
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,050
What is?
The flowers!

715
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,802
Flowers? What flowers?

716
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,889
Claire? Hello?

717
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,808
You know what, I'm
going to call you back.

718
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,172
I need to talk to you.

719
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:46,969
I'm busy with
physical education.

720
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,221
I believe you're familiar
with that subject, right?

721
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:50,639
Noah!

722
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,645
Those flowers?
What were you thinking?

723
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,188
They were
a peace offering.

724
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,108
Do you know what
that looks like?

725
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,110
A student sending
a teacher flowers?

726
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,528
That's why I didn't
sign the card.

727
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,030
And you hacked my email?

728
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,116
You said I could be
in your class.

729
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,368
And you're trying to turn
Kevin against his father!

730
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:12,911
You can't blame me

731
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,247
for the trouble your cheating
ex-husband has brought upon himself.

732
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:16,582
Stop it!

733
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,627
You're welcome, by the
way. For saving your son?

734
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,884
Thank you.

735
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,594
You know what,
you're right,

736
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:29,845
I should have thanked you.

737
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,598
Everything okay,
Claire?

738
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:33,974
Yes, Mike.

739
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,642
Everything's fine.
Thanks.

740
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:41,565
Look, I just want us
to start over, Noah, okay?

741
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:42,983
Can we do that, please?

742
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,071
Yeah. I can if you can.

743
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,325
So, deal?

744
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,452
You can trust me, Claire.

745
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay?

746
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,916
Okay.

747
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:15,015
Allie? Hey.

748
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:17,518
Hi, Kev.
Need something?

749
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:21,688
Yeah, um, I need four three-eighth
hex head bolts, nuts and washers.

750
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:25,150
And I need an air filter
for a 2012 Silverado Z71.

751
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,110
And I need you to go
to a movie with me.

752
00:42:28,363 --> 00:42:30,197
I'm kind of busy with work.

753
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,491
And now that school's started... Um...

754
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,535
Okay.

755
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,453
Um...

756
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,288
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, then.

757
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,791
But I don't have
a date to the Fall Fling.

758
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,255
Uh, me neither.

759
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:49,299
That'd be really great.

760
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:52,302
Like, really, really, um...

761
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:53,720
Great?

762
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,180
Yeah, great.

763
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,682
Great.

764
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:58,976
Okay. Well, um,
I'll see you around.

765
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,519
Okay, cool.
Okay.

766
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:22,457
I think I like
the first one better.

767
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,917
You do?
Yeah.

768
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:28,005
Then the soldier says, "No, no,
buddy, she didn't have a head. "

769
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:31,925
Oh, God.
It's stupid.

770
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,927
It is stupid.

771
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:49,943
I'm not ready.

772
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:51,111
What?

773
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,780
There's someone else?

774
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:56,575
No! But we were apart.

775
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,660
Hey, no, no. I don't wanna
know. Look, it was nothing.

776
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:01,038
It just made me
realize how lost I was.

777
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:03,206
Me too, Claire.
We gotta...

778
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,833
Listen, we gotta
have a clean slate.

779
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,001
Okay.

780
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:09,004
But until I get
my head straight,

781
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:11,548
I'm not ready to
just jump back in,

782
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:13,550
and I need you
to know that.

783
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:18,513
All right.

784
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,141
It's honest. Okay?

785
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:23,518
No guarantees, I get it.

786
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:24,978
Okay.

787
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:28,315
Um...

788
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,693
I think I had one too many.

789
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:34,363
Can I crash on the couch?

790
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:38,450
Okay.

791
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:54,359
I just want you to know,
I'm not giving up on us.

792
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:58,989
Well, I want you know
that I'm not asking you to.

793
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,916
Kevin! Let's go!

794
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:19,468
What a fucking whore
you are!

795
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:20,802
"Deal," you said.
"Let's make a deal. "

796
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:22,262
You trying to
play me, Claire?

797
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,805
Is that what this is?
Of course not.

798
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,015
Bullshit!

799
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:26,141
What?

800
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,059
Why are you doing this?
Because you're a fucking liar!

801
00:46:28,144 --> 00:46:29,102
What is wrong with you?

802
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:30,187
I'm seeing things
clearly now.

803
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,939
You have to stop! Hey,
Noah, what's going on?

804
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,358
Game on.

805
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,527
Mom, what just happened?

806
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:39,404
Honey, I need you to
stay away from Noah, okay?

807
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:40,989
He's a bad influence.

808
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:42,199
What're you talking about?

809
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,284
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one.

810
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,495
No, I'm not going
to trust you! Okay.

811
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,371
'Cause you're not taking away
the one good friend I have.

812
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:49,748
He is not your friend!

813
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:51,500
Bullshit!
Mom, he's my friend!

814
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:54,169
Excuse me? Watch your
mouth and get in the car!

815
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:56,129
You know, he said you'd do this. What?

816
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:57,464
He said you'd do this,
and if you did,

817
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,799
then it was Dad
talking and not you.

818
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:00,592
He's been right all along!
This is crazy!

819
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:02,511
Noah, wait!

820
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:05,555
Kevin! I'm asking you
to get in the car.

821
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:09,851
See you at school.

822
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,149
Hey! Whoa!

823
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,901
Excuse me.
Hello.

824
00:47:18,528 --> 00:47:20,403
Move! Move!

825
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:34,918
Hey, Peterson!

826
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,421
Your movie was on Turner
Classics last night.

827
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:40,340
The Wiz.

828
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:43,760
It's like the black version
of The Wizard of Oz.

829
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:47,389
The Wizards of Waverly Place
are on tomorrow.

830
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,473
Fuck you, Zimmer!

831
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:49,933
Want some of this?
Yeah, fuck you!

832
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,360
Stop it! Noah, stop it! Stop it!

833
00:48:00,528 --> 00:48:02,028
Get off!

834
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,700
Get up! Get the fuck up!

835
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,453
Noah, stop!

836
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:14,916
Fuck you!

837
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:18,628
So, I was looking
at your files.

838
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:19,754
Why?

839
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,090
I'm a vice principal.
It's my job.

840
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Whatever.

841
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,427
So, what a surprise
I found when we didn't

842
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,053
have your transcripts
from your old school,

843
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,431
so I called them.
Know what they told me?

844
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,141
To mind your own business?
No!

845
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,102
That you were kicked out
for disorderly conduct.

846
00:48:34,896 --> 00:48:37,898
Jason Zimmer's skull is fractured.
You could have killed him!

847
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:39,065
Okay.

848
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,692
I'm not done.
I am.

849
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,445
I'm not! Sit down!

850
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:45,655
I said sit down!

851
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:51,494
You know what I see?

852
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:54,998
I see a pattern of disturbing
behavior. Poor impulse control.

853
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:56,291
You know what I see?

854
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,753
A pathetic old woman
who's trying to look

855
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:00,921
and act like
something she's not.

856
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,255
Something she'll never be.

857
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:05,133
Because all she really is

858
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:11,848
is a dried up,
dirty, fucking cunt.

859
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,148
You're gone,
you're expelled!

860
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,158
Kevin, you don't want
to keep her waiting.

861
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:31,534
Come on,
you're going to be late!

862
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:32,994
Mom, we're going
to get there too early,

863
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,579
nobody's even
going to be there.

864
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,333
Okay, how do I look?

865
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,837
Like the handsomest man
on Earth.

866
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:44,130
Mom, come on,
please, stop.

867
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,173
Seriously, come on,

868
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:46,341
tonight has gotta be
perfect, all right?

869
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:48,677
Because Allie Callahan's the
most beautiful girl in school

870
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:50,512
and I just never thought
she'd actually go out with me.

871
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:51,763
Okay, please, stop.

872
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:54,766
Well, she obviously knows
quality when she sees it.

873
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:56,768
Mmm.

874
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:02,440
She'll love it! Come on!

875
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:05,860
Hey!

876
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:15,286
Hi, Kev.
You look amazing.

877
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:18,832
Thanks, Allie. Uh, you
look really great, too.

878
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,209
Thanks.

879
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,004
Uh, this is...
That's for you.

880
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,213
Thank you.

881
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:26,965
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes?

882
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:28,591
Um, some of the guys
said there's water

883
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:30,051
running out of
the boys' bathroom.

884
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:31,845
Oh, okay. Um...

885
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:34,389
You guys go. Have fun.

886
00:50:34,473 --> 00:50:36,057
Okay.

887
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:37,892
I'll check it out.
Okay.

888
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,606
So, do you like the flower? Yeah.
I love it, thank you so much.

889
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,236
Anybody in there?

890
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,114
Ugh.

891
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:18,975
We need to talk.

892
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:24,856
Your behavior has been
completely unacceptable.

893
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,066
My behavior?

894
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,109
And I'm not going
to stand for it.

895
00:51:28,944 --> 00:51:30,445
Just let me go.

896
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:32,572
So, what, your shit-head
husband comes crawling back

897
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,324
and you're just
done with me?

898
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:35,825
Suddenly,
I'm nothing to you?

899
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,912
Like what we had
never even happened.

900
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:41,456
It was one night, and it was
a mistake! We had nothing!

901
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,876
Hey, hey! Yes, we did.

902
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:50,340
And you loved it.

903
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,051
Just like this.

904
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:54,177
No.

905
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,304
Just like this.

906
00:51:56,388 --> 00:51:57,430
No.

907
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,601
Just like this.
Don't.

908
00:52:10,486 --> 00:52:11,778
You think you can scare me

909
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,988
with some graffiti
on the wall?

910
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,324
Think again!

911
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,993
It's going to be
your word against mine!

912
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:20,745
And who do you think
they're going to believe?

913
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,789
Stay away from me!

914
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,667
And stay away from my son!

915
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,236
Sorry, guys.

916
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:36,863
Good morning!

917
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:46,289
Um...

918
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,832
Give me one second, okay?

919
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:35,713
What's going on?

920
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:37,548
She locked us out.

921
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:41,219
Mrs. Peterson.

922
00:54:47,393 --> 00:54:49,686
Mrs. Peterson,
open this door!

923
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:56,359
Mrs. Peterson!

924
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:02,782
Open this door now!

925
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,632
Mrs. Peterson,
I'm coming in!

926
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,731
Come on in.

927
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:35,857
What the devil's going on?

928
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:37,025
The bell rang
five minutes ago.

929
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:38,192
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed.

930
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:39,360
Take a seat. Come on.

931
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:41,070
Why was your
door locked, Claire?

932
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,947
Oh, I just had
a personal call.

933
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:47,368
You guys take
your seat, okay?

934
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,162
All right.

935
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,914
You know what, give Mrs.
Peterson and I a second.

936
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,633
I'm concerned, Claire.
Very concerned.

937
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:05,636
Your behavior lately has
raised a lot of eyebrows.

938
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:08,014
Mike Avenido
reported an incident

939
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,308
in the gym with you
and Noah Sandborn.

940
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:13,436
Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

941
00:56:13,645 --> 00:56:17,190
That was when I was reprimanding
him for skipping class.

942
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,317
Mike said that you
got physical with him,

943
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:21,402
that you put
your hands on him.

944
00:56:21,653 --> 00:56:23,446
Now, you know what
our policy is regarding

945
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,239
the use of physical force
on students.

946
00:56:25,324 --> 00:56:27,700
Well, I would hardly say
I was using physical force!

947
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:31,079
I'm not questioning
your integrity here, okay?

948
00:56:31,163 --> 00:56:33,664
But I'm questioning
your behavior.

949
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:35,958
Get it together.

950
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:38,002
Please.

951
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:47,804
Hey, Kev!

952
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,478
What?

953
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:57,355
I told your mom
I'd pick you up today.

954
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:01,567
Because I think it's time
for you to drive this bad boy.

955
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:15,498
I'm not used to you driving.

956
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:17,667
Yeah, well,
I've been doing it awhile.

957
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:18,876
I guess.

958
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,922
Come on, buddy,
slow down.

959
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,092
You like to drive fast,
isn't that right?

960
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,970
I mean, why else
get a car like this?

961
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,388
Unless you're trying
to be something

962
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:31,889
that you're just
completely not.

963
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,062
Kevin, slow down!

964
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,647
Do you have any idea
what that was like

965
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:40,982
when you were gone?

966
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,609
You didn't
see her, Dad, okay.

967
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:44,944
She wasn't Mom anymore.

968
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,988
She was just
completely torn apart,

969
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:48,489
and I had to
sit back and watch

970
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:50,032
and there was nothing
that I could do about it!

971
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:54,704
Kevin!

972
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,080
Slow this car down!

973
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,876
Oh, no!

974
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:02,086
Oh.

975
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,713
What's wrong?
What's going on?

976
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:04,964
It's not braking!

977
00:58:05,132 --> 00:58:06,757
Hit the brakes! It's not working!

978
00:58:06,925 --> 00:58:08,259
Downshift!

979
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,386
Downshift, downshift!

980
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:12,805
There's no clutch! What do
you mean there's no clutch?

981
00:58:12,973 --> 00:58:15,057
Look out!
Here comes a car!

982
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,225
Look out! Watch out!

983
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,895
Oh, fuck!

984
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,230
Okay. All right, here goes.
Straight, straight.

985
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:23,733
Here comes another one,
Kevin. Stay right here!

986
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,610
Kevin, look out!
Look out!

987
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:29,113
Nothing's working, Dad!

988
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,449
We gotta get off the road!

989
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:33,075
Emergency brake, punch it!

990
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,660
Punch it!

991
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,163
Oh, shit!

992
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,922
I'm so sorry!

993
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:49,342
Are you all right? It's okay.

994
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:52,220
It's okay, son.
It's okay.

995
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,167
Kevin!

996
00:59:26,922 --> 00:59:27,922
Garrett?

997
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,257
Hey, we're in here
watching TV.

998
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:34,178
What happened to your car?

999
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:36,722
Oh, nothing. I had a
little fender bender.

1000
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:38,140
We're all right.

1001
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:39,559
Yeah.

1002
00:59:39,726 --> 00:59:41,394
They look, uh,
fine to me.

1003
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,480
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

1004
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,899
We're watching
the Detroit Grand Prix.

1005
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,150
Come on in
and get a slice.

1006
00:59:48,402 --> 00:59:50,820
Yeah, there's
plenty of room.

1007
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:54,532
I gotta unpack
the groceries.

1008
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:57,994
I'm gonna get something
else to munch on.

1009
01:00:00,455 --> 01:00:01,581
Look at these clowns.

1010
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:02,915
Do you have any chips?

1011
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,334
You took pictures!

1012
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:07,670
A video, actually.
Capture the moment.

1013
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,089
Come over tonight.

1014
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,966
After they're asleep.
Say, 2:00?

1015
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,634
Go fuck yourself!

1016
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:15,511
I'd rather fuck you.

1017
01:00:16,388 --> 01:00:18,347
You're fucking crazy!

1018
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,642
Who should I
show it to first?

1019
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:22,935
Garrett?

1020
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:25,605
Or maybe... Kevin!

1021
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,189
No!
Yeah?

1022
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,775
Do you want a soda?

1023
01:00:30,402 --> 01:00:32,111
That sounds good.
Thanks!

1024
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,696
Hey, I'll take another
cold one, please!

1025
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,364
Yeah, anything
for you, Garrett.

1026
01:00:38,744 --> 01:00:40,244
I'll leave the light on.

1027
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:52,882
Noah?

1028
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,767
Hey, you're early.

1029
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:04,185
Where's the damn video?

1030
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,228
Why are you so angry?

1031
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:07,980
What you did in my
classroom today?

1032
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:09,440
You've been avoiding me.

1033
01:01:09,524 --> 01:01:11,734
What do you think? This is some
kind of game we're playing here?

1034
01:01:11,943 --> 01:01:13,235
This is real life!

1035
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,404
That is my home!

1036
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:16,906
Okay. You're doing things
in front of my kid,

1037
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,282
in front of my husband?

1038
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,328
Your husband. Your fucking
cheating, lying husband?

1039
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:25,915
Okay. What's your plan?

1040
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,334
What do you think? What do
you think, we're going to date?

1041
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:31,879
We're going to go on
family vacations together?

1042
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:34,632
What do you think
is going to happen here?

1043
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:37,051
Here? Nothing.

1044
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:39,345
But it's a big world
out there, Claire.

1045
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,763
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

1046
01:01:40,847 --> 01:01:42,473
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

1047
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:44,934
Wait.

1048
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:55,277
You see that video,
and the proof of our love

1049
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,783
as a threat to this life,
but I see it as a promise.

1050
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:02,868
For a better one.

1051
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,122
And none of this will
ever see the light of day.

1052
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:17,800
If you let me show you
what's possible.

1053
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:22,847
Because, Claire,

1054
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,809
I will never

1055
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,478
ever gonna let you go.

1056
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:36,819
Fucking crazy!

1057
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,756
Oh, Claire.

1058
01:02:57,674 --> 01:03:00,050
Okay,
why didn't you tell me?

1059
01:03:01,553 --> 01:03:04,054
I thought that
I could handle it.

1060
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:06,682
I thought that it was gonna
just blow over, I don't know.

1061
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:08,851
I didn't think he was going
to turn into a stalker!

1062
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:11,771
Okay, okay. Look, we can look
at this picture and we see,

1063
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,273
we know that
he's a psychopath,

1064
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,776
but it's not the way the rest
of the world's going to see it.

1065
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,195
And there's a video.

1066
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:22,865
What?

1067
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,409
There's a video,
and if it gets out,

1068
01:03:26,244 --> 01:03:28,204
you know I'm going to
lose my son,

1069
01:03:28,288 --> 01:03:32,208
my husband,
my job, my life.

1070
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:34,627
Everything that I've ever worked
for. Okay, Claire, listen to me.

1071
01:03:34,753 --> 01:03:37,046
Claire, that's not going
to happen. Do you know why?

1072
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,882
I'm not gonna let that
happen, and neither are you.

1073
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:42,718
No one is going
to see that video.

1074
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:44,804
It won't see
the light of day.

1075
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:16,103
What? VICKY OVER PHONE:
Claire, he saw me.

1076
01:05:16,187 --> 01:05:18,272
Get the hell out of there,
he's coming back there!

1077
01:05:18,356 --> 01:05:20,774
Wait. I haven't even found
the video or the files yet.

1078
01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:23,694
Get the hell out of there,
you got five minutes max!

1079
01:08:03,897 --> 01:08:05,481
Mrs. Peterson!
Mr. Sandborn!

1080
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,484
You scared the living
daylights out of me. I'm sorry.

1081
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:10,819
What in the world
are you doing here?

1082
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:12,237
Sorry.

1083
01:08:15,366 --> 01:08:16,700
Tell me that you're home,

1084
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:17,910
and that all the doors
are locked.

1085
01:08:18,078 --> 01:08:19,328
Yes.

1086
01:08:19,454 --> 01:08:22,915
And I found the computer
and I deleted all the files.

1087
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:24,666
Good. Good.

1088
01:08:24,751 --> 01:08:26,835
But I found something else
even creepier.

1089
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,088
I'm not surprised.
He's a freak!

1090
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,548
Does Ethan know any cops
in San Bernardino?

1091
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:32,925
Oh, I'm sure he does.

1092
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,301
If we're not having
dinner with his mother,

1093
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:35,803
we're having dinner
with cops.

1094
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:37,012
Why?

1095
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:39,014
Just a hunch.

1096
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:42,434
I might have to go
there later. I'll call him.

1097
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,061
He went to Laughlin
with his mother

1098
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:45,938
for her birthday.
Welcome to my world.

1099
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,356
But listen...

1100
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:49,608
Whay?
He's here!

1101
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,943
Get out of there! Run!

1102
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:53,362
Claire! Claire!

1103
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,030
I'm gonna call the cops!

1104
01:08:57,117 --> 01:08:59,034
Talk to me, Claire! I'm dying!
He's trying to force the lock.

1105
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,202
Whay?

1106
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,912
Oh, God!

1107
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,748
Run, hide!

1108
01:09:09,003 --> 01:09:10,879
Hey, Mom,
what's with the knife?

1109
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:12,131
It's Kevin.

1110
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:13,382
Oh, my God!

1111
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,591
Oh.
I'm going crazy.

1112
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:18,011
You guys have to spend the
night with me, out here, okay?

1113
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:19,972
Oh, God.
I love you very much.

1114
01:09:20,306 --> 01:09:22,057
I'll talk to you later.

1115
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:37,656
Ethan, uh, said you wanted to
take a look at the Sandborn case.

1116
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,782
Yes.

1117
01:09:38,867 --> 01:09:40,117
Sad. I remember it.

1118
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:44,079
They were on a back road
outside San Bernardino.

1119
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,875
Tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car.

1120
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:02,598
The crash killed both
passengers instantly.

1121
01:10:02,682 --> 01:10:04,516
And it was ruled
an accident?

1122
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,518
Bodies were destroyed,
so there was no toxicology.

1123
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:08,478
But we assumed
the driver was drunk.

1124
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:10,230
Why was that?

1125
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,524
Well, he had
a long history of DUl's.

1126
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:16,278
Or his brakes went out. I mean,
they could have been tampered with.

1127
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,281
Well, Mrs. Peterson,
even if his brakes went out,

1128
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:21,742
there was no indication
of malfeasance.

1129
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:23,785
Sometimes,
breaks malfunction.

1130
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,121
Sometimes, people drive
while intoxicated.

1131
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:27,581
This is the Sandborn car.

1132
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:36,840
If you don't need
anything else...

1133
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:41,136
One more question,
Detective. Um...

1134
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:45,474
Was this a 2006 minivan?

1135
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:49,144
Well, yeah.
That's exactly what it is.

1136
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:52,898
Is there something else I
need to know, Mrs. Peterson?

1137
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:57,069
No.

1138
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:01,823
Thank you.

1139
01:11:18,925 --> 01:11:20,175
Hey, Noah.
Are you home?

1140
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,343
Yeah, what's up?

1141
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:22,761
You got plans tonight?

1142
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,930
Well, I'm supposed to go
to that car show with my dad.

1143
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,848
Well, I'm over here
working on Vicky's tractor.

1144
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:28,016
You're at Vicky's?

1145
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:29,851
Yeah, I'm at her ranch.
You know where it's at?

1146
01:11:29,936 --> 01:11:32,020
Yeah, no, I think
I know where that is.

1147
01:11:32,105 --> 01:11:33,188
Is everything all right?

1148
01:11:33,273 --> 01:11:35,148
Can you and your dad swing by
and give me a hand?

1149
01:11:35,233 --> 01:11:36,525
Yeah, okay. Let me ask.

1150
01:11:36,609 --> 01:11:37,818
Just get over here.

1151
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,736
Okay, catch you later. Bye.

1152
01:11:43,658 --> 01:11:46,034
Let me just start off
by saying I'm sorry.

1153
01:11:46,911 --> 01:11:50,872
No, really, I am very,

1154
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,668
very sorry,
Vice Principal Lansing.

1155
01:11:55,795 --> 01:11:58,964
See,
I've got a bit of a temper.

1156
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,300
There's no denying that.

1157
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,594
And sometimes,

1158
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:06,805
it gets the best of me.

1159
01:12:07,473 --> 01:12:10,392
Like, when I feel
like I'm being bullied.

1160
01:12:10,768 --> 01:12:13,145
And no one likes
to be bullied, Vicky.

1161
01:12:13,855 --> 01:12:15,689
Can I call you Vicky?

1162
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:18,358
I mean, given that
I'm in your house,

1163
01:12:18,443 --> 01:12:20,068
and it's after hours,

1164
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:22,696
calling you Vice Principal
just feels,

1165
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:26,074
I don't know, wrong.

1166
01:12:30,538 --> 01:12:32,581
See, my guess, Vicky,

1167
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:35,792
is that, uh, you don't
like to be bullied.

1168
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,337
I mean, who would?

1169
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,716
But that's what you were
doing to me today.

1170
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,761
You and Claire.

1171
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,387
Now, the two of you,

1172
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,849
with your little secrets.

1173
01:12:52,894 --> 01:12:54,561
You were playing a joke.

1174
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:56,938
A silly little game.

1175
01:12:57,648 --> 01:13:00,484
Trying to make me think
that you were her,

1176
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:04,363
so she could do what?

1177
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,828
Something sneaky?

1178
01:13:13,331 --> 01:13:15,332
Something...

1179
01:13:17,377 --> 01:13:19,669
She's hiding from me?

1180
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:22,172
What was it, Vicky?

1181
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,470
No, no, no.

1182
01:13:29,514 --> 01:13:30,931
Let me.

1183
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,061
Vicky!

1184
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,105
Listen, I am pretty sure

1185
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:40,816
that Noah tampered with the
brakes on his parents' car

1186
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,150
and that's why they crashed.

1187
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,654
And I'm pretty sure he did
the same thing to Garrett's.

1188
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:48,073
Claire, I need you.

1189
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,450
I need to talk.
Can you come over?

1190
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:23,191
Vicky?

1191
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:49,509
Vicky! Are you upstairs?

1192
01:15:02,273 --> 01:15:03,482
Vicky?

1193
01:15:10,823 --> 01:15:11,865
Vicky.

1194
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,262
Oh, my God!

1195
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:40,977
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1196
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,792
911. What's your emergency?

1197
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,627
Out!

1198
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,630
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1199
01:16:12,677 --> 01:16:14,094
You killed Vicky!

1200
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:17,472
For you. For you, okay? She
wasn't your friend, Claire!

1201
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,224
Hey, hey, hey!

1202
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:22,143
When I love somebody,
I protect them.

1203
01:16:22,228 --> 01:16:24,187
That's what heroes do.

1204
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,232
No heroes kill their
mothers and fathers!

1205
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:31,736
I would never ever
hurt my mother.

1206
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,863
I loved my mother,

1207
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:35,490
but she killed herself.

1208
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:41,162
My cheating father
and his whore

1209
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,789
got what they deserved.

1210
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:43,999
But, hey.

1211
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,419
I protect people I love.

1212
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:49,879
This is all for you.

1213
01:16:49,964 --> 01:16:51,131
Okay?

1214
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:54,843
No!

1215
01:16:56,887 --> 01:16:58,430
Now, let's go.

1216
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:16,865
Garrett!

1217
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,828
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

1218
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:25,123
Well, he ran into
a 14-inch crescent wrench.

1219
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,458
Mom!

1220
01:17:27,126 --> 01:17:28,251
Kevin!

1221
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:31,379
Noah, you hurt my mom,
I swear to God...

1222
01:17:31,464 --> 01:17:32,464
Really, Kevin?

1223
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:34,257
I would never
hurt your mother.

1224
01:17:35,426 --> 01:17:36,426
I love your mother.

1225
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:38,887
Just steady your breathing,
baby!

1226
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,222
And honestly,
I'd hoped you'd see me

1227
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:43,016
as a mentor
who cared about you

1228
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,479
more than your
cheating father ever did.

1229
01:17:48,773 --> 01:17:49,939
Tell him, Claire.

1230
01:17:50,107 --> 01:17:51,149
Do you need your shot?

1231
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:52,400
Mom.

1232
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:54,611
You know,
it's destiny, Claire.

1233
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:56,404
And you can't
interfere with destiny.

1234
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:57,822
Mom.

1235
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,123
We're meant to be.

1236
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,792
And Garrett

1237
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:12,087
needs to know that.

1238
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:14,297
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

1239
01:18:22,139 --> 01:18:23,306
It's gonna be okay.

1240
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:26,810
You know, I was going
to take Kevin with us.

1241
01:18:28,396 --> 01:18:31,064
Seems like he's got too
much of his father in him.

1242
01:18:31,148 --> 01:18:32,273
No, he needs to go.

1243
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:33,775
No! No, no, no.

1244
01:18:35,486 --> 01:18:37,112
No, he's not like
his father at all.

1245
01:18:39,824 --> 01:18:42,784
Noah, you've taught him.
You've changed him.

1246
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:51,209
All right.

1247
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:52,836
All right, then, uh...

1248
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,005
He'll come with us.
Yes.

1249
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,634
Form our own family.

1250
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,150
Mom! Mom!

1251
01:19:32,543 --> 01:19:33,668
Please, Noah!

1252
01:19:33,753 --> 01:19:35,587
Please, just stop this!
Let me help you.

1253
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,255
There's still time.

1254
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:40,383
There's no time.
This is our time!

1255
01:19:40,468 --> 01:19:42,510
You'll never be lovelier
than you are right now!

1256
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:45,889
We will never be here again!

1257
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,201
What are you doing?

1258
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:09,287
Building a funeral pyre.
What does it look like?

1259
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,375
You can't do this!

1260
01:20:14,919 --> 01:20:16,211
No!
Stop!

1261
01:20:19,465 --> 01:20:20,757
I'm sick and tired
of everyone

1262
01:20:20,841 --> 01:20:22,634
going back and forth!

1263
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:24,344
So, it's time to
make a choice, my love!

1264
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:28,056
You either live with me
or you die with them.

1265
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,099
No! No!

1266
01:20:58,796 --> 01:21:00,255
Take Kev
and get out of here!

1267
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:03,466
Ahhh!

1268
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,803
No! No!

1269
01:21:08,556 --> 01:21:11,099
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1270
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,978
Oh, my God!
Stay with me, Garrett!

1271
01:21:15,354 --> 01:21:18,356
Garrett, stay with me!
Stay with me!

1272
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,109
All right.
Let's go, Claire.

1273
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:26,698
You'll see.
You and me. Off-grid.

1274
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:30,326
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

1275
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,625
You can trust me.

1276
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:39,419
But, Noah,

1277
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:41,713
you can't trust me!

1278
01:22:01,025 --> 01:22:03,151
Die, you piece of fucking shit! No!

1279
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:25,882
Ahhh!

1280
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:58,289
Sorry, buddy,
but sometimes even heroes

1281
01:22:58,374 --> 01:22:59,707
have to make tough choices.

1282
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:00,792
Noah!

1283
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:03,711
Noah! Noah!

1284
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,048
You're no hero!

1285
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,832
I'm here.
I'm right here.

1286
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,585
All right, guys, lift
on three. One, two, three.

1287
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,921
Me and Kevin
are right here, sweetie.

1288
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:55,596
We got him now, ma'am.

1289
01:23:55,681 --> 01:23:57,724
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be fine.

1290
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:00,810
Just hang in there.
Hang in there.

1291
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:03,312
You're gonna be okay.

1292
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:08,109
You're going to be okay.

1293
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,487
And then we're
gonna go home.

1294
01:24:14,241 --> 01:24:16,200
You hear me?
We're going home.
