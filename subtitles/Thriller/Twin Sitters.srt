1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:02,521
Previously...

2
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:04,365
We'll talk later.

3
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:08,918
Albert, if you come up to Lewis Fork,
I can recommend a place for lunch.

4
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:16,919
- Leo called you?
- He asked for the rest of the money.

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,885
She was supposed to hand it
over today. She checked out on us.

6
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,759
We're lucky we're in jail.

7
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,798
You know what's gonna go down
with Leo when we get out.

8
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,525
No!

9
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,400
No!

10
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:59,160
No, no, no, not in my room.
In here, in here!

11
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:02,518
- Jerry, back from Paris?
- Ben, what a nightmare!

12
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:06,481
Right there! No, right there.
What is with you guys?

13
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,445
I've got a sandwich in there,
I want all those bags open.

14
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,643
We're looking till we find it...

15
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:15,766
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back.

16
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,358
- Sylvia...
- Benjamin!

17
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,566
OK, OK... Gone! Goodbye!

18
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,562
Brother Ben, this is the best
damn sandwich I ever ate.

19
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:33,480
It's a baguette with brie and butter.

20
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,036
I had four of these every day I was there.

21
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,846
You've got to try this thing.

22
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,760
Here, go ahead, eat it. Go ahead.

23
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,918
Go ahead!

24
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:45,526
Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,405
This is incredible, Jer!

26
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:10,045
You know what this reminds us of?
You know who likes this?

27
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,364
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny
down by the river.

28
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:20,920
- My God, you're right!
- Am I right? Am I right?

29
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,605
Oh, no wonder!

30
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:34,083
Jer, outside, outside.

31
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,358
Always a pleasure.

32
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,324
Jerry...

33
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:02,762
Leland's daughter was murdered,
and the Norwegians left.

34
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,760
- Did they sign?
- Deal's off.

35
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:16,766
We had those Vikings by the horns!
What happened?

36
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,842
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took their translator with them.

37
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:27,486
Did you say Leland's daughter
was murdered?

38
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,524
Yes.

39
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,522
I'm depressed.

40
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,677
I can fix that.

41
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,166
There's a new girl
at One-Eyed Jacks,

42
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,717
freshly scented
from the perfume counter.

43
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:51,683
And you, brother Jer, have
a 50-50 chance of being first in line.

44
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,677
I like those odds.

45
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:02,477
All work and no play
make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

46
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:06,640
- That's right.
- Let's jump in the boat.

47
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,758
That's great huckleberry pie,
Mrs Hayward.

48
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,081
Thank you, James.

49
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:34,156
Well... Mrs Hayward and I are going
to say good night, James.

50
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,603
- Good night, James.
- Good night.

51
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,837
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mom.

52
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:43,238
Don't worry about the dishes,
I'll clean up.

53
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,559
Are you coming to church with us
in the morning, Donna?

54
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,604
Yes.

55
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,401
- Nine o'clock sharp.
- OK.

56
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,997
- Good night, James.
- Good night, sir.

57
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,442
Hi, sailor!

58
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,360
Good evening, Mr Horne.

59
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,164
Ben, we're not gonna go
in the casino first?

60
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:32,361
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt,
I just came to take it off.

61
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:36,486
- Kim, the Horne brothers are here.
- I'll tell Blackie.

62
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,766
I'd like to order two drinks.

63
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,680
One double scotch on the rocks.

64
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,482
And my brother would like
a double scotch on the rocks.

65
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,881
That's two double scotch on the rocks.

66
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,885
Next stop, rocket science.

67
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,481
Jerry...

68
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,557
- Blackie!
- Benjamin.

69
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,200
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

70
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,483
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate

71
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,605
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May

72
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,998
"And every fair from fair
sometimes declines

73
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,159
"By chance or nature's
changing course untrimm'd

74
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,046
"But thy eternal summer
shall not fade

75
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:43,324
"Nor lose possession
of that fair thouowest

76
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,877
- "Nor shall death brag..."
- Where's the new girl?

77
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:53,637
When you really want love,
you'll find it waiting for you.

78
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,884
Heads.

79
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:58,483
Come on. We'll take care of you, Jerry.

80
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,321
Well...

81
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:13,118
Donna, I don't think that
what we're feeling or doing is wrong.

82
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,558
Why not?

83
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,722
Because it's the truth.

84
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:23,157
Because I think it would have
turned out this way anyway.

85
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,363
You do?

86
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:31,523
Yes. I remember
a time in school, in the hall.

87
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:35,356
We were suddenly alone,
and we looked at each other.

88
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,883
I almost told you I loved you then.

89
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,158
It's true.

90
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,283
It is true, isn't it?

91
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:54,558
Oh, James. I guess because of Laura
I couldn't say anything.

92
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:59,078
- I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me, too.

93
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:05,723
Are we gonna be together, James?

94
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,564
Are we?

95
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,316
Are we, James?

96
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,282
- Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Hello, it's Hawk.

97
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,080
Deputy Hawk,
how is Ronnette Pulaski?

98
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:54,320
- Body and spirit are still far apart.
- What did you find out?

99
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:58,082
Ronnette recently quit at the
perfume counter of Horne's store.

100
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,681
Everything else is quiet,
ex cept there was...

101
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,844
a one-armed man snooping
around intensive care.

102
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:07,124
- A one-armed man?
- Left.

103
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:11,997
- Did you question him?
- No. I pursued, but he got away.

104
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:17,878
Maintain an around-the-clock watch on
Ronnette. We'll speak in the morning.

105
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,606
Got it?

106
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,918
Supposed to leave it
in this stupid football.

107
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,318
Is it in there?

108
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,838
Not all of it.

109
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,842
Cash on delivery, Bobby.

110
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,000
He's got a gun.

111
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:17,845
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey.

112
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,964
Who's that?

113
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,441
- Is someone with you?
- Never mind.

114
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,639
Toss it over here, quarterback.

115
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,361
It's empty.

116
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,485
Weren't you supposed to
leave something for me?

117
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:42,966
This barely covers what we paid for.
Where's the rest?

118
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,324
- Where's the rest of the money?
- There's a...

119
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,081
- There's a problem.
- Problem?

120
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:54,198
- Laura had it.
- You think you got problems?

121
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,399
We can get it.
Wait until everything settles down.

122
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,842
You punks owe me ten grand.

123
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,721
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.

124
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:09,317
OK. We won't take delivery
on the drugs until you get the cash.

125
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:13,162
- Do I look like a bank?
- I appreciate your position.

126
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,285
How could I anticipate
this thing with Laura?

127
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,438
Laura was a wild girl.

128
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,199
Tell me about it.

129
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,881
Maybe. Someday.

130
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:28,115
Take your hand
out of your pocket, Mike.

131
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,677
- What is your problem, Leo?
- Problem?

132
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:35,080
You want to know about problems?

133
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:36,680
OK.

134
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:41,762
You're on the road,
driving back and forth, gone for days.

135
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:45,442
- You get back, and guess what?
- What?

136
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:49,395
You find out your old lady's
been giving it away.

137
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,523
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

138
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:55,720
Stepping out in your own
damn bedroom. That's a problem.

139
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,764
I guess so. I guess it is.

140
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,758
- Do You know who?
- A man needs a clean house.

141
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,321
Sure. So do You know who?

142
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,800
- I'll take care of it.
- Sure.

143
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,959
And this other thing,
we'll take care of it, don't worry.

144
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,716
We'll get the cash,
and everything will be square.

145
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:30,481
- Go out for a pass.
- What?

146
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,639
- Go out for a pass.
- OK, just...

147
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,399
- Run.
- Take it easy.

148
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,286
Run! Run!

149
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,921
Damn it, I'm done, Bobby.

150
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,999
Let's get the hell out of here.

151
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,485
- Ed!
- Sorry, I didn't see it.

152
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,558
Youstepped on my drape runner!

153
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,606
- It was in the middle of the floor.
- Think that's an accident?

154
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:42,602
I laid those out there myself. I was up
all night working on that invention.

155
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,637
- I'm real sorry, Nadine.
- Ed, you make me sick!

156
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,718
That's it! Exactly sixty feet, six inches.

157
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,196
It's perfect.

158
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,520
What do you think he's up to?

159
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,161
It beats me.

160
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,399
Invitation to love.

161
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:43,395
Each day brings a new beginning,

162
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:49,244
and every hour holds the promise
of an invitation to love.

163
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,078
Right.

164
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:00,044
- Who is it?
- The big, bad bobcat.

165
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,203
Are you crazy?
What are You doing here?

166
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,961
I just passed Leo out in North Bend.

167
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,403
- We've got at least twenty minutes.
- Where's your car?

168
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,558
Parked in the woods. Open Sesame!

169
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:14,800
Somebody might see me out here,
and that'd be worse.

170
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,077
Bobby, you cannot
come by here like this.

171
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,958
We can't meet, for a while.

172
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,555
What the hell happened to you?

173
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:37,283
Leo Johnson happened to me.

174
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,961
That bastard. Come here.

175
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:46,166
Bobby! If he finds out about us,
he's gonna kill you.

176
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,598
He'll kill us both.

177
00:19:54,527 --> 00:20:00,238
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.

178
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,842
I mean it.

179
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,718
Cup of coffee.

180
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,686
It's not the first time,
it won't be the last,

181
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,367
but I'm in that doghouse again.

182
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,722
What happened this time?

183
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:54,802
I popped a grease gun, stepped on a
drape runner, and all hell broke loose.

184
00:20:54,967 --> 00:21:00,280
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store.
All she talked about is the drape runners.

185
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:03,683
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.

186
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,279
Bobby sure gave me a good one?

187
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:14,276
- Where do you want these rocks?
- There by the doughnuts, Deputy.

188
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,086
- Anyone for a warm-up?
- Oh, yeah!

189
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,846
- You bet!
- Thanks, Lucy.

190
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,080
Damn good coffee!

191
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,839
And hot!

192
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,321
Would everyone please take a seat?

193
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,521
By way of explaining
what we're about to do,

194
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:52,159
I am first gonna tell you a little bit
about the country called...

195
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,084
Tibet.

196
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,605
An extremely spiritual country,

197
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:02,884
the leader of Tibet is known
as the Dalai Lama.

198
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:07,080
In 1950,
communist China invaded Tibet.

199
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,357
While leaving the Dalai Lama
in charge,

200
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,722
they seized control of the country.

201
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:14,765
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising
against the Chinese,

202
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:17,481
the Dalai Lama fled to India

203
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,286
and has lived in exile ever since.

204
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,602
Following a dream three years ago,

205
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:25,486
I have become moved
by the plight of the Tibetans

206
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,962
and filled with a desire to help them.

207
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,765
I awoke

208
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,966
realising I had subconsciously gained
knowledge of a deductive technique

209
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,925
involving mind-body coordination
operating hand in hand

210
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,885
with the deepest level of intuition.

211
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:45,362
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please
assist me, I will now demonstrate.

212
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,519
On the day of her death

213
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,081
Laura Palmer wrote
the following in her diary,

214
00:22:56,207 --> 00:23:02,282
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight."
Today we'll concentrate on the "J's".

215
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:07,317
Harry, when I give the word,

216
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:11,235
would you read aloud each name
I've written on the blackboard?

217
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:15,878
Deputy Hawk, stand here and hold this
bucket of rocks where I can get to them.

218
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,117
Would you please put on
the kitchen mittens.

219
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:21,717
Deputy Andy, move down,
stand by the bottle.

220
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,644
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.

221
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,999
Not too near, Andy!

222
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,922
I'm getting ex cited.

223
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:36,757
If I hit the bottle after a particular name,
make a check on the name.

224
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:42,280
Sheriff, when you say the name, state
that person's relationship to Laura Palmer.

225
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,483
- Ready?
- Ready.

226
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,844
James Hurley...secret boyfriend.

227
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,398
James Hurley.

228
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:06,876
Josie Packard...was instructed
in English by Laura.

229
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,561
Josie Packard.

230
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:16,201
So there's no check
next to either of these names?

231
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,522
That's correct. Please continue.

232
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:22,482
Dr Lawrence Jacoby...
Laura's psychiatrist.

233
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,760
Dr Lawrence Jacoby.

234
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,158
You did it! You hit it!

235
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:34,036
Lucy, make a note that the bottle
was struck, but did not break.

236
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,720
Very important.

237
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:39,157
Andy, put that bottle back
exactly where it was!

238
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:44,845
Johnny Horne. Laura was
his special education tutor.

239
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,202
Johnny Horne.

240
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:57,964
Norma Jennings...helped Laura with
the meals-on-wheels programme.

241
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,163
Norma Jennings.

242
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,077
Shelly Johnson...
waitress at diner, friend.

243
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:08,124
Shelly Johnson.

244
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,643
- Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?

245
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:20,119
It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt a bit.

246
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:23,842
Where there's no sense,
there's no feeling, Andy.

247
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,599
Coop...

248
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:34,195
Tell me...

249
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:39,487
The idea for all this
really came from a dream?

250
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,638
Yes. It did.

251
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,835
Jack with One Eye...

252
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:57,285
Maybe it's the letter 'i',
but there's no 'i' in Jack.

253
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,716
I think it means he only had one eye.

254
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,441
Sounds like Nadine,
Big Ed Hurley's wife.

255
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:05,246
No, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jacks,

256
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:06,965
across the border in Canada.

257
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:09,880
We're gonna have to check that place out.

258
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm going to erase this,
because it's a place, not a person.

259
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:16,317
Maybe the person
could be in the place.

260
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,682
- So should I erase it?
- Yes.

261
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,757
Yes, a person could be in a place,
or yes, I should erase it?

262
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:25,600
Erase it, Lucy. Next name, Harry.

263
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:30,286
Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck,

264
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:34,520
connection with Laura...unknown.

265
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,126
Leo Johnson.

266
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:11,281
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

267
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:17,442
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.

268
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:37,326
- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma. A cup of coffee, please.

269
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:43,644
Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs.

270
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,758
Thanks.

271
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,117
I'm gonna go say hi.

272
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,046
Hi.

273
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,118
Hi, Donna.

274
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:29,081
So my parents said they saw you
at church today. I didn't see you.

275
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,084
I came by because of Laura.

276
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:37,003
What do you mean?
I didn't think you liked her.

277
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:39,925
There were things about Laura
I didn't like,

278
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,845
but she did take care
of my brother Johnny.

279
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:45,043
I loved her for that.

280
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,038
Do you like coffee?

281
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,880
Yeah, with cream and sugar.

282
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:10,926
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

283
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,758
Audrey!

284
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:23,116
But Agent Cooper
likes his coffee black.

285
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,598
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

286
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,840
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

287
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:43,164
What do you mean?

288
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,599
Nothing.

289
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,917
No, what do you mean?

290
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:54,847
He used to sing to her.

291
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:01,843
I love this music.

292
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:06,961
Isn't it too dreamy?

293
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:56,804
Hawk found this half a mile
down the tracks from the crime site.

294
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:02,441
It's a nasty piece of work.

295
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:10,759
Tell Agent Cooper
that Albert and his team are here.

296
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,519
- Albert?
- A-l-b-e-r-t.

297
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,838
- Do we have to stand here all day?
- No.

298
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:20,319
Albert Rosenfield.
R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d.

299
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,958
Sheriff, this is Lucy.

300
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,960
- Is Agent Cooper with you?
- Yes, he is.

301
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:29,442
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?

302
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,963
- Yes, he is...they are.
- We're on our way.

303
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:36,676
- Agent Cooper will be right with you.
- I can hear perfectly well, Curly.

304
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:42,679
Albert and his team are cream
of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius.

305
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,997
I wouldn't expect anything less.

306
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:49,245
But I got to warn you, Albert's lacking
in some of the social niceties.

307
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,479
- Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?

308
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,998
What kind of a two-bit operation
are they running here?

309
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,317
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

310
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:09,725
I've seen some slipshod backwater
burgs, but this place takes the cake.

311
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:12,236
What are you waiting for? Christmas?

312
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:16,525
They're burying this girl tomorrow, and
we've wasted half the day getting here.

313
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:19,247
I suggest you and your team
should get started.

314
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,558
I'll have one of my men
escort you over to the morgue.

315
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:25,161
Results from the local
pathologist's report.

316
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:31,565
Welcome to Amateur Hour.

317
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,881
Looks like an all-nighter, boys.

318
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:38,925
Albert, got a minute?

319
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:45,120
I hear that you're real good
at what You do.

320
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,158
- That's correct.
- That's good.

321
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:51,115
'Cause normally if a stranger walked
into my station talking this crap,

322
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:56,116
he'd be looking for his teeth
two blocks up on Queer Street.

323
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,402
Good night, Ed!

324
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:24,123
- Ed, is that you?
- Yeah, honey, it's me.

325
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:30,236
- Ed!
- Oh, my God.

326
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:37,766
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart,
I have to thank you.

327
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:39,121
Why's that?

328
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:41,602
You don't know
what you've done for me.

329
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:45,919
- No, I don't.
- Oh, Ed, you big lug!

330
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,880
When you tracked that grease
into the house today,

331
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:52,517
you spilled some on my cotton balls.

332
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:57,596
But instead of tossing them out,
I put the greased ones on the runners.

333
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:02,045
And Ed...just listen to this.

334
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:13,284
Completely silent.

335
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,637
- How about that?
- Oh, Ed...

336
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,436
We're gonna be so rich!

337
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:33,125
Everything smells like fish
around here.

338
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:37,158
Well, you could wash
your socks separately.

339
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,518
What did that FBI man want
up here today?

340
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:46,402
Very nice fellow.
Asked a few questions.

341
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,239
About what?

342
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:51,319
Well, he talked to Josie mostly.

343
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:54,757
I had a problem with a fish.

344
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,516
Took a liking to my percolator.

345
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:01,764
What did he want
to talk to Josie about?

346
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,918
Why don't you ask her?

347
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,125
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.

348
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,715
- Thank you.
- You betcha.

349
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,039
Didn't he ask for me?

350
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,727
Yeah, but we said
You were on a world tour

351
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,997
he should contact your press agent.

352
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:33,643
Get your boots off my bed
and go to your room!

353
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:45,526
I didn't want to get mink oil
on my bedspread.

354
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,847
You got mink oil in your head.

355
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:19,118
Two books.

356
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:42,922
Leland...

357
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:46,159
- Leland, stop it!
- We have to dance, Sarah.

358
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,682
We have to dance for Laura.

359
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:52,203
- Leland, stop it! Give it to me.
- We have to dance!

360
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,597
Leland! Leland, give it to me!

361
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,958
What is going on?

362
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:21,235
Leland! What is going on
in this house?

363
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,757
Oh, God!

364
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:23,121
Laura, Laura!

365
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:25,682
Laura!

366
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:39,086
"Through the darkness of future past,

367
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:42,717
"the magician longs to see,

368
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:48,797
"one chance out
between two worlds...

369
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:52,482
"fire, walk with me."

370
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:56,637
We lived among the people.

371
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:00,925
I think you say, convenience store.

372
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,956
We lived above it.

373
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:09,562
I mean it like it is,
like it sounds.

374
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:15,520
l, too, have been touched
by the devilish one.

375
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,440
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

376
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:23,925
Oh, but when I saw the face of God,

377
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,117
I was changed.

378
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,675
I took the entire arm off.

379
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:36,366
My name is Mike. His name is Bob.

380
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:39,246
Mike?

381
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,524
Mike, can you hear me?

382
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:49,640
"Catch you with my Death Bag."

383
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:53,766
You may think I've gone insane.

384
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:56,282
But I promise...

385
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,842
I will kill again!

386
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:07,757
But it...it is Laura Palmer.

387
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,079
Are you Laura Palmer?

388
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:26,002
Harry, it's Cooper.

389
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,761
Meet me for breakfast,
7:00 am the hotel lobby.

390
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,760
I know who killed Laura Palmer.

391
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,316
No, it can wait till morning.
