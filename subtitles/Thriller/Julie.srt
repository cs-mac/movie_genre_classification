1
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:45,375
'A bud, as tender as a flower.'

2
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,716
'A little restless, a little coy.'

3
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:07,234
'Taking the vibrant colors
of the morning with her.'

4
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,832
'A little awake, a little sleepy.'

5
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,645
'She is Julie.'

6
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,266
Greetings! In today's episode
of Coming To The Point...

7
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,270
...we have with us a person...

8
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,329
...who has a turnover
of over 1000 crores.

9
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,432
He is the owner of
twenty industries.

10
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,500
From cloth to polymer.

11
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,671
And from petroleum
to hand made paper.

12
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,805
He has industries expanding
everywhere.

13
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,818
But he has completed only
twenty-seven years of his life.

14
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,021
He is Mr. Mihir Shandilya... and
we have him with us, today.

15
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,846
Mr. Mihir Shandalya.

16
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:03,795
As you all know...

17
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,831
...Mihir is one among the most
eligible bachelors in India.

18
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,698
So let us ask him about
his personal life.

19
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,294
About his love life.

20
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,864
I do not know Tara...

21
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,967
...why are people interested
in other's personal life?

22
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:20,808
That is because you are
a successful businessman.

23
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:24,315
You are a handsome bachelor.
And more than anything else...

24
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,318
...you are a page three victim, too.

25
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:30,322
Page three victim! That is why
perhaps, I did not marry.

26
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,824
Because I never came to know
what marriage exactly is?

27
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,656
Nothing exciting really!

28
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,719
Then, what is exciting for you?

29
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:42,328
A girl who does not believe in the
traditional way of marriage.

30
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,835
A girl with her own identity...

31
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,496
...who just sways, in her
own fun and frolic...

32
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:48,666
Oh! So, there is someone.
I mean, who is she?

33
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,334
I mean, is she from a big family...

34
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,843
...or an NRI or from Bollywood?

35
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:53,675
Come on, Mihir. Who is she?

36
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:58,507
Tara, you will have to wait for
sometime, for these answers.

37
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,080
I would like to say just one thing...

38
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:05,516
...that I have loved someone
for the first time.

39
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,684
And how much I've understood her...

40
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:11,526
...it seems that she is the
wild orchid of my heart.

41
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:18,769
She is like the open sky. She is
transparent as the waterfall.

42
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,366
She is fiercely independent
like the wild orchid.

43
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:29,711
To get her is like getting an
island full of natural beauty.

44
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,381
Who is certainly a part
of this earth...

45
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:34,545
...but is remote from all boundaries.

46
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:49,133
Well! I mean, she is
a real mystery woman.

47
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,563
But, we respect your mystery woman.

48
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,732
But, we desire that we will
meet you again...

49
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,799
...with her on this show.

50
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,400
Sure. - Thanks a lot for
your precious time.

51
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,740
Thank you, Tara.

52
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,677
Here. Keep the change.

53
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,840
Excuse me. Is Tara Aggarwal here?

54
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,606
Tara Aggarwal. Sorry madam.

55
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,671
I do not think that she
will be in the office.

56
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,444
Then, where will she be?
- Must be in the studio.

57
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,779
And where is the studio?

58
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,843
What is the matter?
- Sir, is Tara here?

59
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,445
Yes. She is in her cabin.
- Okay. - Thank you.

60
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,650
Who is she? I do not know sir.

61
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,953
Just a minute madam! You
cannot meet her, now.

62
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,462
I want to meet her, right now.

63
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,464
Do you have an appointment?
- No.

64
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,523
Then you will have to take an
appointment. - Then give it to me.

65
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,659
Listen madam.

66
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,135
Appointments are not handbills
that can be distributed freely.

67
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,195
You can meet her only after a week.

68
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,797
I cannot wait, for even a second.

69
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,469
You are too much! Why are
you in such a hurry?

70
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,205
What... what work do you
have with her? Tell me.

71
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,644
I want to give her my interview.

72
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,944
Interview!? But why? Are you okay?

73
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,481
I'm saying this in my
complete senses...

74
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,645
...that I want to give my interview
to Tara Aggarwal...

75
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,881
...and that too, as soon as possible.

76
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,820
Why? What do you think of yourself?

77
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:21,827
Aishwarya Rai! Shobha De!
Kiran Bedi or Ms. India.

78
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,690
I am not any one among them.

79
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,031
Then too I want Tara Aggarwal
to take my interview.

80
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,004
Because my name is Julie
and I am a call girl.

81
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,064
A prostitute by profession.

82
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,904
A professional fancy woman!

83
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,676
Fancy woman!

84
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,245
So what? Does that
make a difference?

85
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:50,682
You might be a call girl. A
professional fancy woman.

86
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,850
But my program does not
promote profession...

87
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,862
...but personality. And a
personality, that matters!

88
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,195
With fame and with capability.
Do you understand?

89
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:15,075
I am ahead of all of them.
Especially for you.

90
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,880
I am the in quote, mystery woman...

91
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:21,887
...in the life of Mihir Shandalya,
Tara Aggarwal.

92
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,013
What?

93
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,563
Does Mihir know this?
- My arrival here?

94
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,962
That you are a prostitute.
- No.

95
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,570
I want the Mihir and whole
world to know it, together.

96
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:48,580
9821062247, is his number.

97
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,914
You are dialing Mihir's
number. Right?

98
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,589
You might think, that I
might be a psychic case.

99
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,750
Why would a great personality...

100
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,090
...like Mihir Shandalya
love a girl like me?

101
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,325
And anyway Mihir's status
is more important to you...

102
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,798
...than my remarks or my story.

103
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,937
Tara, you might ignore
this girl who claims...

104
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,805
...to be the dream girl of Mihir,
by terming her insane.

105
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:20,940
But a girl, even in her insanity
will not call herself a prostitute.

106
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:22,106
Listen, Julie.

107
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,946
Here investigation has more
value than emotions.

108
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:28,351
When you interviewed Mihir,
how much did you investigate?

109
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,117
The world already knew
a lot about him.

110
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,625
And why would a successful
celebrity lie?

111
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,219
Perhaps, VIPs have truth written
on their forehead!

112
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,032
My profession is not a respected
one. But I promise you.

113
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,638
That I will put neither
you in trouble...

114
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,298
...nor the family of Mihir.

115
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:56,043
Listen Julie. I cannot promise
you anything, for now.

116
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,646
I mean, I will have to
speak to my seniors.

117
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,983
It is too late in the night.

118
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,645
Shall I drop you somewhere?

119
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:08,651
Tara, I do not fear the night
getting longer or being unsafe.

120
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,388
I will manage on my own.

121
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:15,166
Coming and going alone, is
not a new thing for me.

122
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:19,227
I had arrived to Mumbai
from Goa alone, too.

123
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,210
That small city was the
whole world for me.

124
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,077
There, every day used to
begin with freshness...

125
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,411
...and transparency
like that of water.

126
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:36,748
'The one who comes in my dream...

127
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:42,083
...is spreading everywhere
like inebriation.'

128
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:47,252
'He is the most sweet.'

129
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,092
'Ln the dewy mornings.'

130
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:54,156
'Ln the moist nights.'

131
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,107
'Ln the pleasing fragrance.'

132
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,943
'Ln the sweet talks.'

133
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:13,779
'I recall you.'

134
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,879
'Your face has resided
in my vision.'

135
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,357
'Your face has resided, sweetheart.'

136
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,826
'Your dream is adorned in my eyes.'

137
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,386
'Your face is adorned, sweetheart.'

138
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:18,916
'My every desire is for you.'

139
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:23,354
'You are there, day and
night in my heart.'

140
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,020
'My heart is lost in your thoughts.'

141
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:32,858
'Ln lonely alleys.'

142
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,592
'Every moment in the buds.'

143
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,378
'Ln the saga of love.'

144
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,541
'Knowingly or unknowingly.'

145
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:55,212
'I recall you.'

146
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,932
'My heart says you, to
take me in your arms.'

147
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,594
'Take me in your arms.'

148
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,661
'I am longing for you.'

149
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,674
'I am longing for you.
Come and love me.'

150
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:10,118
'What is this craziness? '

151
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:15,031
'My mind is restless without you.'

152
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:20,300
'I have given my heart to you.'

153
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,965
'Ln long nights.'

154
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,637
'Ln small talks.'

155
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,983
'Ln the procession of the nights.'

156
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,492
'Ln the rains of the spring.'

157
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:46,598
'I recall you.'

158
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,201
Everything here
looks just like magic.

159
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,577
The night feels like it
is dipped in black ink.

160
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,208
This ocean. This sand. These rocks.

161
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:41,219
They become bluish green
in the morning.

162
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:45,454
The water in the morning
becomes denim blue.

163
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:50,223
It reminds me of you.
Do you know Neel?

164
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,557
Do you not think Neel? That the
fishes shine like gold...

165
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:54,657
...when the sunrays fall on them?

166
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,604
Maybe.
- Maybe?

167
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,239
Today, you spoke just like papa.

168
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,469
Do you know Neel that I used
to come to stroll here...

169
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,070
...with my papa in my childhood?

170
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,139
And I used to ask the
same questions to him.

171
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,082
Sometimes he used to answer...

172
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,086
...and sometimes he used
to reply, maybe.

173
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,145
And one day I asked him...

174
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,589
...that, where does a man
go after his death?

175
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,685
Then he replied that he goes on
the other side of the ocean.

176
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:24,423
And he becomes a seagull.

177
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,089
Then I asked that
whether a seagull...

178
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,099
...becomes a man after it's death.

179
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,425
Then he said, maybe.

180
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,760
From that time I am observing.

181
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,772
This ocean is the same.

182
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,610
When I started growing up,
strolling with papa...

183
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,670
...and asking questions
started decreasing.

184
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:44,109
Now, when I come to see you.

185
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,117
The same questions
linger in my mind.

186
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,610
Do such questions come
in your mind, too?

187
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:52,624
Such questions! Many questions
arise in my mind.

188
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,124
Then tell me. What questions
arise in your mind?

189
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:58,627
When will these fishes
that shine like gold...

190
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,861
...become the money in my
bank balance and shine?

191
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,135
When will these fishes
fall in my net...

192
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,137
...rather than in Briganza's net.

193
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,333
Or I will entrap that Briganza in
my net, along with those fishes.

194
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,142
Always, that Briganza
comes in between.

195
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:18,149
Julie, how will I marry you if
I do not take Briganza's name?

196
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,479
How will I buy a house?

197
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,677
I do not want to become a small man.
I want to become the king.

198
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,154
I will become a big businessman.
- Then become.

199
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,656
But I am telling you, now itself.

200
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,886
A small house and two meals
a day, is enough for me.

201
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,758
And if the time demands, I will
even run a small bakery.

202
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,888
To earn some money.

203
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,495
Are you mad? You will run a bakery!

204
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,693
What is wrong in that?

205
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,759
My dad has been running the
bakery, since thirty years.

206
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,168
And he is doing the same
thing for thirty years.

207
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,728
Bread for Rs.2 and cookies
for Rs.4. What else?

208
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,364
Hey Neel! You can say anything
that you want to me.

209
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,170
But if you say anything
about my father then...

210
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,343
Sit twenty-four hours glued
to the TV and drink feni.

211
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,744
What else does your father know?

212
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:51,506
Go and run your father's bakery.

213
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:10,525
What happened?
- I got a job.

214
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,594
As an airhostess. That too
in Virginia airways.

215
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,366
I have become an airhostess.
- Congratulations.

216
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,203
I have to go to Mumbai and join,
tomorrow itself.

217
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:20,371
Papa, just look my friend
has become an airhostess.

218
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:30,219
Wow! It seems that beauty is not
a qualification any more...

219
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,883
...to become an airhostess. - Yes.

220
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,756
And now only beauty queens
are selected, Mr. Ralph.

221
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,887
Did you understand dear papa?

222
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:42,627
I understood. But who will
give the sweetmeats?

223
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,896
Ralph, your father or her uncle?

224
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:06,415
Neel, meetings like this and
roaming on bikes is enough!

225
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:08,483
What must be your mummy
and daddy thinking?

226
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,654
You know? Even my papa is asking.

227
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,253
What is going on between you two?

228
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,923
I deny it, by saying that nothing is
going on. But if he asks me again...

229
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,435
...then I will tell him that
we are going to marry.

230
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,430
Are you listening?

231
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,441
I will tell papa that
we are going to marry.

232
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,908
Should I tell him, Neel?

233
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,672
I'm talking to you and you are
riding this bike, silently.

234
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,780
Are you going to roam with me...

235
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:30,941
...like this on a bike,
the whole life?

236
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,010
Neel, will you speak something?

237
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,299
What should I say? Tell me,
what should I say?

238
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:52,831
Should we do a child marriage?

239
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,896
Should we become a burden
on our parents?

240
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,805
We will go on a honeymoon
for two days.

241
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,867
And after that, should I spend the
rest of my life...

242
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,309
...sleeping alongside
dad in the hall...

243
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,370
...and you alongside mother
in the kitchen?

244
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,309
Then we'll produce kids in one year.

245
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,374
And we will make them grandfather
and grandmother.

246
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:07,816
And I will go with my lunch
box to the trawler...

247
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,320
...you will go to leave
the kids to the school.

248
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,652
We will keep on toiling,
till we become old.

249
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,715
I do not want such a mundane life.

250
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,316
I will marry, when
I become something.

251
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,486
When I will have lots of money.

252
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,553
I will marry, when I become
a big businessman.

253
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:29,338
Julie, listen to me.

254
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,503
Julie, listen to me.

255
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,027
'A bud, as tender as a flower.'

256
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:10,441
'Fused in the colors of love.'

257
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:27,458
'For the first time
on the path of love.'

258
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:32,054
'She is giving her heart
to someone, silently.'

259
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:06,497
'A bud, as tender as a flower.'

260
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:11,832
'Fused in the colors of love.'

261
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:17,836
'For the first time
on the path of love.'

262
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,847
'She is giving her heart
to someone, silently.'

263
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,280
Hey! Where were you all?

264
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:58,947
And do you have the intention...

265
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:00,211
...of celebrating Santa Monica
party without me?

266
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,946
What Santa Monica party!

267
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,280
First Dinky went to Mumbai...

268
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,056
...and today Neel went to Mangalore.

269
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,116
Who will organize the party?

270
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,121
Neel went to Mangalore?

271
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,225
Yes. When he came back after
meeting you in the night...

272
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,730
...he sat before dad
like a sensible boy.

273
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,567
And he started talking
about business.

274
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:26,233
It felt like, all his childishness
came to an end.

275
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:28,905
Then, he went to meet Briganza.

276
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,775
There he talked about
going to Mangalore.

277
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,745
And he went, too.

278
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,588
Julie, my child, we know that...

279
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,647
...all this has happened
because of you.

280
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:42,249
You must have made him understand.
Did you not?

281
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,094
Julie, just wait. I will
bring some tea for you.

282
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,598
No aunt, I must move.
- Julie wait.

283
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,190
No aunt, I must move, now.

284
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:50,792
I just recalled, that I have
to do an important work.

285
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:55,096
'A bud, as tender as a flower.'

286
00:24:55,674 --> 00:25:00,008
'Fused in the colors of love.'

287
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:05,112
'With lot of dreams in her eyes.'

288
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:09,620
'She riding on the wings of air.'

289
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:40,982
God, what kind of God are you?

290
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,044
First you get my breath
stuck for air.

291
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,112
And then you make
me breathe heavily.

292
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:50,155
You certainly want my job done.

293
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:55,057
I knew, that you are always with me.

294
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,158
That you will like my likeness.

295
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,831
God, you had come as a good
thought in Neel's head?

296
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:04,669
He is a good man.

297
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:07,871
He is a little hotheaded
and short-tempered.

298
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,171
But, he is intelligent.

299
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,410
Did you see how he changed,
in just one day?

300
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:16,685
Now, many things are
going to change, God.

301
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,089
His business will commence.

302
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:23,350
And... and after that we will marry.

303
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:27,197
And after marriage, whether
he likes it or not...

304
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,029
...I will give him a
lunch box everyday.

305
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:32,965
After all a husband should eat
food cooked by his wife.

306
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:37,103
He says this now. But
after marriage...

307
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:39,439
...I will have to go to leave
the kids to school.

308
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,440
And I will not leave him,
I mean Neel for free.

309
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:49,720
In the evening or on Sundays, I
will ride with him on his bike...

310
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:50,880
...that too with our...

311
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:54,389
...two kids.

312
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,221
I will certainly make
him quit smoking.

313
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:02,130
God, even you can't tell any
one in Goa, to stop drinking.

314
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:04,894
I will go from here now...

315
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:09,469
...and make a list of things
that I want in Neel's house.

316
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,938
His father is a little
rough and tough.

317
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,736
But his mother is just
like a jellyfish.

318
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:33,928
Hey Julie.

319
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,323
What are you doing.

320
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:40,263
There is big news in
the paper. Get up.

321
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,932
Then what is so new about that?

322
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:46,942
Whatever it maybe, but this news
is useful to you. Get up.

323
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,170
Government must have
increased the price...

324
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:51,272
...of corn flour or there must
have been load shedding.

325
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,784
Not of the corn flour...

326
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,514
...but the price of your
Neel has increased.

327
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,514
Price of Neel?

328
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,525
Neel has struck a business
deal with Briganza.

329
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,796
Now Neel will look after the
business of Briganza...

330
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:07,126
...in Goa as a partner.

331
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,358
I will go and wish him, right now.

332
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,823
Congratulations Briganza!
Today, you made Neel...

333
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,491
...your business partner as
well as your son-in-law.

334
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:55,340
'The dreams of my eyes got burnt.'

335
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:02,851
'Just see, someone has deceived me.'

336
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:09,360
'This life is scattered to pieces.'

337
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:14,524
'Why did the season go down
in this moment of love? '

338
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,197
'Why did the season go down? '

339
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:10,919
I had asked Dinky to send me...

340
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,923
...the telegram for a job interview.

341
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,084
That house...

342
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,928
My trademark, my cycle...

343
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:19,088
Puppy dog.

344
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,128
Every alley related to that house...

345
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:28,598
...where I had seen some
dreams with Neel.

346
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,132
I had to leave, everything.

347
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,935
Father, by wishing me farewell...

348
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:38,346
...without speaking a word,
shared my sorrow.

349
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:44,345
I crammed the Julie
from the childhood...

350
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:46,413
...till now, in the small bag.

351
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:51,018
It was very painful for me to
stay there, even for a moment.

352
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,965
Without even looking back...

353
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:59,629
...I came to Mumbai to Dinky's house.

354
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,131
Dinky certainly gave me some time...

355
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,973
...to get out from the
chloroform of memories.

356
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,311
And she even gave me hope
to start something new.

357
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:15,476
Listen Julie. This not
Goa, but Mumbai.

358
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,522
And if you want to become
something on your own...

359
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:20,714
...then you have to keep certain
things in your mind.

360
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:28,728
Rule No. 1. Never believe
in what you see.

361
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:32,161
Did you understand?

362
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,400
Now let's talk something practical.

363
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,009
I talked to one Mr.
Shah for your job.

364
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:40,567
He is a reputed builder.

365
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,738
Go and meet him at his
office in the morning.

366
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,173
Tomorrow morning?
- Yes. At ten o' clock.

367
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,266
I am Julie. Mr. Shah has called
me for an interview.

368
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:17,267
So you are Julie?
- Yes sir. And this is my...

369
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:20,106
Ms. Julie, date of birth, education.

370
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,668
No. There is no need for this.

371
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:27,615
I had told Dinky that day,
that since you have...

372
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,120
...recommended I can appoint blindly.

373
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:36,786
Thank you, sir. Since
when should I join?

374
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:43,123
Now that you are appointed,
from today, now.

375
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,822
What is this? The marble has
not been polished, yet.

376
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,691
Sir, it will be finished by today.
- When? - Till evening, sir.

377
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,754
And the bathroom which is here?

378
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:15,163
Sir, I have talked with
Mr. Mishra about it.

379
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,497
Look, Sharma, I do not
sell concrete blocks.

380
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,560
I sell houses. Understand?

381
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,901
I do not like this kind of work.

382
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:37,178
It seems that you do not like
this sample flat much...

383
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,246
...which everyone adores.

384
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:49,199
To tell you the truth then...
- No problem. Go ahead. Speak.

385
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,201
Then what? Tell me clearly.

386
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:57,537
Sir, I did not like certain things.

387
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:02,371
Look, Julie. The liking
of the ladies...

388
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,438
...are very important for marketing.

389
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:10,550
Sir, change the color
of these walls.

390
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:14,419
Why? What is wrong with this?

391
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:17,222
There is nothing wrong.
This is the matter of mood.

392
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:19,388
As you want to sell houses
and not concrete blocks...

393
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:22,433
...if there was an open sky
between these walls...

394
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,628
...I mean if we color the
walls sky-blue then...

395
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,433
...it would feel as
if there is a sky.

396
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,404
And in a busy city like Mumbai if
we color the walls sky-blue then...

397
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:46,415
Hey listen!

398
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:50,258
Is Rohan at the site?
- I will just find it out.

399
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,990
Okay let it be. Show the
shade card to madam.

400
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:55,760
The color of the walls needs to be
changed. - I will just show her.

401
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,303
Had you gone on a long trip?

402
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,310
No! I was just traveling
around India.

403
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,314
That is, why I did not come here.

404
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:46,646
And anyway, whom do I need
to impress here, in India?

405
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,811
You talk too much.

406
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:52,379
Tell me, what have
you brought for me.

407
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:54,322
What can I give you, Delnaz?

408
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,486
Because whatever I give you,
will be useless for you.

409
00:36:57,562 --> 00:37:00,497
And what you want, I will
not give it to you.

410
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,863
I understood that in the beginning.

411
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:11,500
Delnaz, she is my best friend.

412
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,907
She is from Goa. Her name is Julie.

413
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:22,545
And for me? At least give
me some commission.

414
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,611
If you want to earn commission...

415
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:28,022
...then earn it on mangoes,
not on grapes.

416
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,501
She is the owner of this
parlor for name sake.

417
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,637
But actually she supplies women.

418
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,040
She is a pimp.
- Then why are we here?

419
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:56,986
Now, show normal expressions and...

420
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:58,886
...look at the other
face of this city.

421
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,587
Never interfere in somebody
else's life. Understood?

422
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:32,814
You?

423
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,924
You are the one, whom I met in the
lift a few days ago... - Yes!

424
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,697
The air of Mumbai is
also astonishing!

425
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,427
It would transform any
caterpillar in to a butterfly.

426
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,838
First, you got this job.

427
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:56,445
And secondly you got me sacked.
- Yours?

428
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,847
By the way, my name is Rohan.

429
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,612
I am the design consultant
for Shah constructions.

430
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:04,948
Please have a seat.

431
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,462
That day I just gave a suggestion...

432
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,623
...and sir immediately
took action on it.

433
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,525
How can I say that the
mistake was... - No!

434
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,627
It is neither your
mistake nor Sir's.

435
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,104
You know it is said that one
strike of a blacksmith is...

436
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:23,970
...equivalent to hundred
strikes of goldsmith.

437
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,133
I just keep dragging
the same routine.

438
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,976
What are you saying? You are the
experienced creative consultant here.

439
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,039
And you are the new
personal assistant.

440
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:33,879
You just get the colors
changed in a jiffy.

441
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,647
Then you won't need to snap your
fingers to change a consultant.

442
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:38,814
Mr. Rohan, you definitely
have a misunderstanding.

443
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,825
How can I explain you that...
- Offer me a cup of coffee.

444
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:42,985
I will understand.

445
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,027
Just a single cup of coffee.

446
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:49,897
By the way your suggestion is very
beautiful and intelligent too.

447
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,992
Then offer me a cup of coffee.

448
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,061
And treat me for your success.

449
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:08,110
People like you having good taste...

450
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,518
...are very hard to find
in our business.

451
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,522
This coffee is just an excuse.

452
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,717
I am a designer by profession.

453
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,521
I demand different, I see different.

454
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,789
When people go after peacocks...

455
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,924
...and dance like the
peacock dances...

456
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:27,530
...then my view is set on
a graceful white swan...

457
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:31,541
...on a quiet lake sitting in
a very aristocrat position.

458
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:35,543
Who seems like a rich boy
sitting comfortably...

459
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,740
...and drinking wine.

460
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,881
Then the peacock's dance
looks like a dance step...

461
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:44,183
...from a Hindi movie.
- And your swan?

462
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:47,147
The gracefulness of the swan
is like that of the opera.

463
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,955
You look like a person having
two different personalities.

464
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:53,128
Really?
- Absolutely.

465
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,891
Scorpions are like this.
- Do you believe in horoscopes?

466
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,159
They all are like graphic
designs for me.

467
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,296
Sometimes I use them and
sometime I read them.

468
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:05,569
But you must be a Libran.
- How did you know?

469
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,578
The way you are balancing every
matte and then speaking.

470
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,580
But I am totally opposite of that.

471
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:14,584
If pockets are empty or
not, always aim high.

472
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:16,916
But you have money in your
pockets, right now?

473
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:20,647
This is all because of Dinky.
Dinky is my best friend.

474
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:24,759
Today whatever I am, the
change that you are seeing...

475
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:27,093
...all credits goes to Dinky.

476
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:31,101
Your talks are also interesting...
are very interesting.

477
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:42,004
You... why are you shivering so much?

478
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:44,274
The AC here is too effective.

479
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,614
The AC is not effective.

480
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:51,212
Your sleeveless is too short.
- That...

481
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,820
What do you intend to do now?

482
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:31,852
Now? I am not at all hungry now.

483
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:34,993
Why?
- Just like that.

484
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:38,160
If you intend to sleep wearing
my jacket then...

485
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:48,075
'Julie! '

486
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:59,680
'The springs have returned.'

487
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:04,692
'Lt has brought the
fragrance of love.'

488
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:09,697
'With a new hope in her eyes.'

489
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:14,702
'Her heart is singing again.'

490
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:26,713
Rohan, I will definitely
forget how to commute...

491
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,911
...in bus and trains because of you.

492
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,250
If you say then I will stop the
car and we will go by train.

493
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,381
You, travel in a train?
Have you ever heard...

494
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:35,448
...the names of Mahalaxmi
and Lower Parel?

495
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,887
More than you. I have traveled
till Virar in the train.

496
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:41,056
The car and the success you see...

497
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:43,225
...is all the result of my hard work.

498
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:48,004
Did not I tell you, I
have very high aims?

499
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:52,071
Have you ever heard the story
of the tortoise and the rabbit?

500
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:55,403
What about that?
- The tortoise is my uncle.

501
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:59,749
Okay Mr. Raj Kumar 'Tortoise.'
Can you tell me...

502
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:02,411
...where are you taking me
all dressed up like this?

503
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,754
I have a prospective client Mr.
Vadhwa. It is his party.

504
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,088
Maybe in this party, Mr.
Vadhwa would...

505
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,151
...give me the contract
for his new scheme.

506
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,161
What will I do in your
business party?

507
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:17,291
Be with me. You are my inspiration.

508
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:20,428
What do you say... you
are my lucky mascot!

509
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,178
Mr. Rohan!

510
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,195
I have heard that you
make beautiful designs.

511
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:48,297
But I have seen for the first time...

512
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:49,993
...that you carry your
structure with you.

513
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:54,127
He is Mr. Vadhwa. And
she is Ms. Julie.

514
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,863
She is Mr. Shah's
personal assistant.

515
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,137
Fine!

516
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,468
You are the one who got the
color of the walls changed...

517
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:04,537
...and the whole scheme
was a sellout.

518
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:12,820
Look, you have a good job.
Continue with it.

519
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,826
But, if you can think of
some miracle like this...

520
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:20,990
...with your friend Rohan
then tell me...

521
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,896
...I will name the whole
Poona scheme to Rohan.

522
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:29,565
Condition, just your support.

523
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,034
Why not? Sure sir.

524
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,410
Start making the designs.

525
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:49,017
Did not I tell you that
you are my lucky mascot?

526
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:51,084
But, what do we have to do Rohan?

527
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,392
Mr. Vadhwa is making
a scheme near Poona.

528
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,593
We have to design it's interior.

529
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,206
Julie, if we get this scheme, then
forget the railway station...

530
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,872
...I won't even remember
India's airports.

531
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,144
Was I really his lucky mascot?

532
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,913
He was so happy that night, as if
he already got that contract.

533
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:51,250
This confidence of Rohan
brought me closer to him.

534
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,142
Come in, Julie.

535
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:56,485
This is my client's house.

536
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:01,488
If I get Vadhwa's contract
then even we would have...

537
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,390
...a dream house like this.

538
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:56,045
It is really very nice.

539
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:34,581
'Oh heart tell me.'

540
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:42,081
'Why there is a certain
pain in my chest? '

541
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,588
'Why does it feel like
I'm living with lot of fun? '

542
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:17,116
'Ls this love or something else? '

543
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:37,697
'A certain craziness taken over me.'

544
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:43,212
'Every moment is spent
in restlessness.'

545
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,714
'I have lost something, but
found something, too.'

546
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:55,949
'Why is the atmosphere fragrant? '

547
00:51:56,026 --> 00:52:03,228
'Why is the intoxication rising
to drink this elixir? '

548
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:09,626
'I only want to stay with you.'

549
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,967
'I want to tell you so many things.'

550
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:20,309
'I cannot bear this restlessness.'

551
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:30,810
'Why is my heart beat
making me go crazy? '

552
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:35,322
'Ln this season of love? '

553
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:04,077
Stop!

554
00:55:05,482 --> 00:55:06,972
Take this. Keep the change.

555
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:20,929
I never thought that
you will be so busy...

556
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:22,989
...that I will have to wait for you.

557
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:26,969
There was so much
work in the office.

558
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,436
I could not leave it pending
and come here.

559
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:29,995
Even Shah sir was not there.

560
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:35,444
You came looking for a
job from Goa to Mumbai.

561
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:39,839
But you are so busy that even though
we stay together...

562
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,907
...it has become
difficult for us to meet.

563
00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:44,783
Fine. Then tell me when
are you coming back?

564
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,653
As soon as, you come, we will both
go far away for a vacation.

565
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:49,783
At least after six months.

566
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:55,760
That means six months, madam
with pilot Rakesh...

567
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:56,992
Hey, did you forget the rules?

568
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:59,797
And yes, do not get married
before I come.

569
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,997
And you too, do not take
up another posting.

570
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:04,063
Or else when you come here
you will be an aunt.

571
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,695
Okay, listen to me.
- Tell me.

572
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,830
If you did not have breakfast then...

573
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:39,170
...there are corn-flakes
in the cupboard.

574
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:41,506
If you want to eat an omelet then
the eggs are in the fridge.

575
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,070
Really?
- And yes.

576
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,137
If you want to have lunch with me...

577
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:46,512
...then you are more than welcome.

578
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,016
Stop your blabbering,
finish your work...

579
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:49,177
...soon and come home.

580
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:51,516
No my dear! Your workaholic
teddy bear...

581
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,112
...will meet you only in the night.

582
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,681
But before that you are
meeting Mr. Vadhwa.

583
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:57,522
Sharp at five o' clock with designs.

584
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:01,086
These are our basic designs.

585
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,090
These are the small flats.

586
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:08,730
These are the row houses and
these are the penthouses.

587
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:14,042
Your sense of dressing is good.
- Oh thanks.

588
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,044
As you can see, we have
some plans...

589
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:20,709
...even for these small flats.

590
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:25,545
Julie, when you explain, the
movement of your hands...

591
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:30,059
...and your lips look very sweet.

592
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:35,956
We have given more importance
to space...

593
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:39,729
...rather to than marble
even in big flats and...

594
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:42,567
Julie, I can't understand anything...

595
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,233
...from your laptop presentation.

596
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:50,740
I can't understand where
and how to see it?

597
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,776
It is there before me, but
I cannot see it completely.

598
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:58,752
Why do not we go to the site?

599
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:02,585
Will not it be better, if you
show me each room in detail?

600
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:07,590
After discussing suitable dates
with Rohan, I will inform you.

601
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,598
There is no need for Rohan
to be there. - What?

602
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:12,100
Yes. What will Rohan do there?

603
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:15,761
Let us go on a weekend. We will
see the site on Saturday.

604
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,330
And we will spend the night in
Khandala in our guesthouse.

605
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,205
And after coming from the
site, when we are together...

606
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,272
...the remaining queries
will be solved, too.

607
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:31,142
The contract which is verbal till
now, will be confirmed there.

608
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:33,952
Monday morning, you will be
in your home or office...

609
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:37,619
...with the contract. Duly signed,
sealed, delivered.

610
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:46,633
What happened?

611
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:49,638
There is a limit to shamelessness!

612
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,970
What happened? Did you
quarrel with taxi driver?

613
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:59,138
What happened? Did he
reject the proposal?

614
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:00,806
He did not have any interest
in my proposal.

615
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:03,819
Then did he have it in the quotation?
- Not even in the quotation.

616
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:08,714
In the beginning, I
did not understand.

617
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:11,317
He complimented my dress
sense and mannerism.

618
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:17,825
This Vadhwa is some what a
colorful man.

619
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:20,834
He has the habit of showing
off his poetic skills.

620
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:24,172
I am saying some thing serious.

621
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:26,675
Even I am serious about it.
It is a straightforward fact.

622
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:29,678
Straightforward?
- You know there also fools like...

623
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:32,010
...the ones who brag
about themselves.

624
00:59:32,082 --> 00:59:35,074
This Vadhwa of yours is neither
an idiot nor a fool.

625
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:37,014
He is a dog!

626
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:42,213
He wants me to join him at the site
and explain him all the designs.

627
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,422
And stay with him in Khandala at
night and settle all queries...

628
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:49,698
...so he can convert the verbal
contract into a written one.

629
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:54,026
Julie, the dog is an animal
with such behavior.

630
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:56,695
He looks very faithful.
And it is too.

631
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,966
No matter how much you train him...

632
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:02,375
...he will never change his habit
of raising his leg, while peeing.

633
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:03,878
Rohan, what are you saying?

634
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:06,241
Now look, if Vadhwa wanted
something from you...

635
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:09,046
...why would he ask you.
He would have asked me.

636
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:19,227
What was the need
to react, this way?

637
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:38,740
Julie, the matter is that
sometimes we are...

638
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:41,147
...not able to understand
the simplest of things.

639
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:45,754
Simple things? Some
strange man asks me...

640
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:49,815
...to spend a night with him and
you call it a simple thing?

641
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:53,091
Rohan, are you in your senses?

642
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:55,757
After what he said,
it was like standing naked...

643
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:58,096
...in front of him, for me.

644
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,159
And you call it a simple thing?

645
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,276
Nothing is enough, Julie. Nothing.

646
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:12,510
Neither my drinking,
nor Vadhwa's demand.

647
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,785
If there is anything overstock,
then it is your thinking.

648
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,954
You think a lot. Why
do you think, so much?

649
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:24,116
You went with so many
designs to Vadhwa...

650
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:28,297
...did Vadhwa think about
it? He did not.

651
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:31,299
And without thinking anything...

652
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:33,459
...he asked you to spend a
night with him. That is it.

653
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:36,532
I will tell you a story
of a lady monk.

654
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,964
There was lady monk like you.

655
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:45,143
So once she happened to be very late,
while asking for alms in a village.

656
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,873
That village was not
in her district.

657
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:50,978
She went from one house to another...

658
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:54,821
...but no one was ready to give her
a place to stay for the night.

659
01:01:55,892 --> 01:02:00,022
In the end she slept under
a tree with a blanket.

660
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:03,022
That night was a full moon night.

661
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:05,828
The whole village, the streets,
the trees, the mountain...

662
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,166
...everything was showered
with moon light.

663
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:12,568
She had never seen such an
amazing sight of nature.

664
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:17,571
In the morning she went to
each and every home and thanked them.

665
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:20,849
She thanked them, because
that night if they would...

666
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:23,852
...have given her a place to
stay, then she would have...

667
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,184
...never known how it feels to
be showered by moonlight.

668
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:29,852
I did not understand anything.

669
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:33,594
Everyone sleeps every night
at their own homes.

670
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:37,030
But if you would have slept
just one night with Vadhwa...

671
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:41,868
...you would have know
how it feels to be...

672
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:45,271
...showered in the silver
of the money.

673
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:49,269
As it is I was about to marry you.

674
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:54,212
But the rest of our life would have
been spent in shining nights.

675
01:02:58,955 --> 01:03:00,889
Vadhwa was just a street dog.

676
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:04,220
But you just do not play with
the pattern of language...

677
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:07,054
...you sell them at
the time of your need, too.

678
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,495
You have been telling stories
from the beginning till today.

679
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,898
But today this lady monk
story proves that...

680
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:16,905
...you are such a person
who would present...

681
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:18,406
...flowers offered to
God in a funeral...

682
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:20,466
...and present funeral flowers
to someone on his or her birthday.

683
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:23,969
To fulfill your own dreams...

684
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:27,080
...sending your girlfriend
to a stranger's house.

685
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,408
People living in slums
are better than you...

686
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,920
...because they would
not let their women...

687
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:34,081
...bow their heads
in front of anyone.

688
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,082
I abhor myself.

689
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,522
Because... because I...

690
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:47,934
Because I had a relation with
a person like you, Rohan.

691
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:52,935
Vadhwa only wanted to
remove my clothes.

692
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:57,536
But, you have peeled off my skin.

693
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:04,447
I held your hands with such
great faith in you.

694
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:13,122
But you have separated those
hands from my shoulders.

695
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,964
You want to shower silver on me?

696
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:23,298
You want me to dance
in rain for you?

697
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,372
As it is I was going to marry you.

698
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,967
What do you mean by as it is?

699
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:32,639
I should marry you.

700
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:35,979
And sleep with someone
else on your command.

701
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:42,384
In love, love and hate
is a common thing.

702
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:49,397
You do not have the status
to take my name.

703
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,524
You are such an insect, which I
would not even like to step on it.

704
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,131
You did not come to the
parlor since many days.

705
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:11,475
No. I do not want to do anything.
- But why?

706
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:15,074
Dinky was saying that
you have friend...

707
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:17,242
...who is your business partner.

708
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,413
You trapped a Mumbai fish right
after coming from Goa.

709
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,761
Must be thinking that
I would avenge this.

710
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:39,437
Then these hands thirst
to slap him just once.

711
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:42,440
Then the feeling of vulnerability...

712
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:44,844
...and then the ice cold
feeling of helplessness.

713
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,778
In these conditions to
cry on someone's lap...

714
01:06:50,853 --> 01:06:54,118
...or ask for help, it
feels so shameful?

715
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:58,123
My hearts just sinks.

716
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:01,286
Why did this all happen with me?

717
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:03,127
Why again and again with me?

718
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,671
And this is the only
sentence, Julie...

719
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,138
...which changes our lives.

720
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,676
Why again and again with me?

721
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:20,308
This is the source of all
problems. Why with me?

722
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,310
This is the right time
to think of ourselves.

723
01:07:25,388 --> 01:07:28,482
Who am I? What do I get?

724
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,150
When anything happens like this...

725
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:34,560
...then our confidence
level just drops low.

726
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:41,895
They start thinking, that is
there any defect in me?

727
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:44,697
Men just move out easily.

728
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:47,569
Women get tired. Get defeated.

729
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:50,578
And men just want this and that.
We get tired and lose.

730
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:53,911
And not only does he believe in it
but is confident about it, too.

731
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,349
She is just a woman.
What could she do?

732
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:58,680
Now just see, the one
you loved...

733
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:01,189
...you gave him everything
that belonged to you...

734
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:04,522
...and how easily he got ready to
share you, with some one else.

735
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:07,586
The strange thing is that,
instead of strangling him...

736
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:10,598
...we prefer strangling ourselves.
We commit suicide.

737
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,697
I know that even you must have
thought of committing suicide.

738
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:17,863
But tell me one thing
Julie is it sensible...

739
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,932
...to give up your own life,
for someone else's mistake.

740
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:24,207
I know my question is irritating.
But I will still ask it.

741
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,543
What will you do?

742
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:34,220
You left Goa to forget the past.

743
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,723
Now living with that same
sadness is not good.

744
01:08:38,294 --> 01:08:41,559
The way you left Shah's
job in moments.

745
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:45,633
To get it back won't be much
of a difficult task for Shah.

746
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:50,898
You too, have fought. But
not Rohan and Shah.

747
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:54,401
No matter how much pity
he shows to you.

748
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:56,240
He will not break the deal.

749
01:08:57,747 --> 01:09:00,773
To call someone daughter
and to be a daughter...

750
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,909
...are very different matters, Julie.

751
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,649
And now about Dinky.

752
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:07,983
She is not here, right now.

753
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:10,423
Then where will you go?
Where will you live?

754
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:12,791
Again some Neel, again some Rohan.

755
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:18,264
The world is not round Julie,
it's a merry-go-round.

756
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:23,601
How easily these bastards force
us women to commit suicide.

757
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,773
The phase which you
are going through...

758
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:30,278
...many girls have gone
through that phase.

759
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:32,610
They are still going through it and
they will still go through it.

760
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:34,613
Even I have gone through that phase.

761
01:09:35,785 --> 01:09:42,281
But I have changed my suicidal
thoughts to my happiness.

762
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,294
Think as if a suicide
is a full stop...

763
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:50,364
...then your own happiness
is a comma.

764
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:56,695
Now all that I have told
you, in all of this...

765
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,811
...in all of this there is only
one thing common. Our body!

766
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:07,047
Everybody wants our body.

767
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:16,323
By shoving, by whistling,
by love, by introduction...

768
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:19,327
...by applying bindi, by offering
the marriage necklace.

769
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:21,829
...by getting married, there
is a rape every night.

770
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:24,830
But the matter remains the same.

771
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:42,009
I listened to what Delnaz
said without any reaction.

772
01:10:43,519 --> 01:10:46,511
Then on a certain turn I
left her and moved on.

773
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:49,414
With only one question in my mind.

774
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:50,686
Who am I?

775
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:54,360
Who am I, only I can
answer this question.

776
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:57,856
Instead of someone else
making my identity...

777
01:10:58,034 --> 01:11:00,093
...I would make my own identity.

778
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:02,427
This is what I have decided.

779
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:05,099
I found the answer to Delnaz's
puzzling question.

780
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,540
And I wanted to answer her first.

781
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:11,046
For me this was the
last turn of my life.

782
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,667
I misjudged you.

783
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:49,978
Maybe my name and
work took over me...

784
01:12:50,046 --> 01:12:53,106
...that I asked you unbearable
questions for no reason at all.

785
01:12:54,650 --> 01:13:00,486
I mean, being a woman I reacted
as a normal person.

786
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,649
But now my heart is cleared.

787
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:08,996
I will try to take your interview...

788
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:11,499
...with all the respect as
I took Mihir's interview.

789
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:47,260
Julie, there is no need
to open the door.

790
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:55,076
Today, I want to take you
to a special place.

791
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:11,056
Brother Mihir has come!

792
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:35,911
What is your name, my child?
- Julie.

793
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,585
I'm Sonia. Your Mihir's
younger sister.

794
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:47,755
This is aunt, Pinky, uncle. That
is mother and this is Sunny.

795
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,591
Papa is in London right now.

796
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,600
Brother must have already told you.
And this is our grandmother.

797
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:55,000
We know all the well known
families of the north.

798
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,334
Are you from one of the famous
families of the MP's?

799
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:01,603
Are you brother Mihir's
mystery woman?

800
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,346
Whatever you are or wherever
you are from.

801
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,117
You are Mihir's choice. And I have
complete faith on my Mihir.

802
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:18,791
I only want that you should
take care of my Mihir.

803
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,172
The channel people
have agreed to us.

804
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,711
I just had an excellent
confrontation with the CEO.

805
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,840
We will telecast your interview
from our channel's studio.

806
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,645
And that too live.

807
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:45,218
I mean for the first time
in India a prostitute...

808
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:47,312
...will be interviewed
live on television.

809
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,319
Just think of it, Julie. The
people who are watching...

810
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:54,658
...these boring family soaps, when
they see your interview...

811
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,322
...then they'll be shell shocked.

812
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,401
And yes, by the way you have to
come to our studio for promotion.

813
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:10,338
What a lovely feeling is to
be in love with someone.

814
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:20,344
You know Julie, everything
feels different.

815
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:24,692
I have heard that in love, girl's
hearts are much restless.

816
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,024
But, even we men get very restless.

817
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,856
Do you know, that since yesterday,
all songs played...

818
01:16:29,932 --> 01:16:32,025
...on FM felt like, singing
my own feelings.

819
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,429
What was that song?

820
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:38,905
When I saw a girl I felt like...

821
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:41,201
Do you know that song?
- What?

822
01:16:41,777 --> 01:16:44,211
That song is there which says,
when I saw a girl I felt like...

823
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,271
...the morning sun, and much more.

824
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:48,043
My list became much longer.

825
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:50,712
First shower after jogging.

826
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:52,714
Applying cologne after shaving.

827
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:03,896
You are supposing that they
have already agreed.

828
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:06,261
I know my family well
from my childhood.

829
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:09,737
And there is no tradition
of lying in my family.

830
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:14,936
We give away our choice not
with words but with a smile.

831
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:16,734
From their smile I have found that...

832
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:18,905
...you have won not only mine
but all of our hearts.

833
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:27,419
Julie, I come here many times
with my family for outing.

834
01:17:27,823 --> 01:17:30,257
But today the same spot is looking...

835
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:32,317
...much more beautiful
in your company.

836
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:07,795
'Love is difficult, I knew that.'

837
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:13,802
'I would never love,
I believe that.'

838
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:20,798
'But I do not know, why
I fell in love.'

839
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:26,314
'I have given my heart to you.'

840
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:32,318
'I have lost all my rest and peace.'

841
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:25,030
'I tried a lot to stop my heart.'

842
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:39,543
'But my heart only
thought about you.'

843
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:48,055
'When I am with you I forget
about the whole world.'

844
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,896
'I enjoy ages of peace in
just a single moment.'

845
01:19:57,973 --> 01:20:03,240
'I will be blamed for many sins.'

846
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:09,078
'I knew that my name
would be ruined.'

847
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:16,315
'But I do not know why
I fell in love.'

848
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:21,920
'I have given my heart to you.'

849
01:20:21,997 --> 01:20:27,936
'I have lost all my rest and peace.'

850
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:07,633
I am going to London for 15 days.

851
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:10,543
I'll try.

852
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:13,480
My grandfather used to say...

853
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:15,983
...that trying is the stepping
stone to success.

854
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:19,316
Even if you slip up, then too
your hopes do not budge.

855
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:27,989
Hi, I am Julie.

856
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:29,553
I am a call girl by profession.

857
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:34,000
I will be on your TV sets
this week. Do meet me.

858
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:37,527
Havoc! We will create
a havoc, you just see.

859
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,501
They will forget about
all this Jassi crap.

860
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:45,012
And they will only say one thing,
there's no one like Julie.

861
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,071
But will we get any ads
at such short notice?

862
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:48,343
Of course, we will get it.

863
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:50,678
Just show me that family promo.

864
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,681
I am Julie. Did you recognize me?

865
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:59,356
No! Maybe then your daddy,
brother, boyfriend...

866
01:21:59,428 --> 01:22:02,022
...or your husband might
have met me somewhere.

867
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,031
Did not they tell you about me?

868
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:09,193
How could they tell? Because
I am a call girl. Julie.

869
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:11,262
Now you see how we will
be showered by ads.

870
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,035
Call them, and get the
release order by fax.

871
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:16,043
And in the evening, send a peon
to get the advance payment.

872
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:19,205
She has grabbed every
corner of the society.

873
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:22,045
And this third one is a bit arty.

874
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,378
For the literature type people.

875
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:27,650
To an extent even the social
movements would like this.

876
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:29,215
Look at this.

877
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:34,059
Some call me Radha,
some call me Meera.

878
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:37,790
Some call me Tulsi. What
is my real identity?

879
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,233
I am Julie. Prostitute!

880
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:44,731
I would say that madam Tara
would like to run this.

881
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:47,307
Have you made any list for
prospective clients?

882
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:49,071
There is no need of that, Rishi.

883
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:51,078
Any ways all the condom
companies are after us...

884
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:52,408
...for total sponsorship.

885
01:22:53,148 --> 01:22:55,639
Okay, see this promo for men.

886
01:22:55,751 --> 01:22:57,742
People say that I sell my body.

887
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:01,247
But the truth is that I buy manhood.

888
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:05,420
And that too by not giving money,
but by taking money.

889
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:08,095
What kind of business is this?

890
01:23:08,263 --> 01:23:10,322
You will get to know
about it, this week.

891
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:13,295
I am Julie. Prostitute!

892
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:16,495
Is there anything more
daring than this?

893
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:19,096
To come here and say that
I am a prostitute?

894
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:21,267
First film stars used to sell.

895
01:23:21,343 --> 01:23:22,833
Then businessmen used to sell.

896
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:24,435
Now prostitutes will sell directly.

897
01:23:24,513 --> 01:23:26,504
Will the government
put a ban on it?

898
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:30,108
Hey buddy, we have attached the
banner for HIV awareness to it.

899
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:32,449
That's it! - And by the way this
is going to be telecast live.

900
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:34,614
Any ways these promos are fine.
- Should we telecast them?

901
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,519
I will drop a bomb in two days.

902
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:41,456
Do you know Sonia, I came
to this restaurant...

903
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,521
...for the first time with Mihir.

904
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,724
You did not tell me where did you
meet brother for the first time?

905
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:49,134
We met after that so many times...

906
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:50,671
...that I forgot of
our first meeting.

907
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,198
Actually, mother and sister-in-law
wanted to come along too.

908
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:56,634
I stopped them.

909
01:23:57,212 --> 01:23:59,646
I did not want that our today's
meeting should be...

910
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:02,479
...taken over by talks about
marriage and family only.

911
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:04,642
I only wanted to chat with you.

912
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,712
Any ways calling you here
without any intimation...

913
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:10,883
...far from home, you must have
realized my purpose for it.

914
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:14,491
You are soon going to be the
daughter-in-law of my house.

915
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:34,579
So they are all preparing
for marriage. That is good.

916
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:40,184
But today I had gone
to a restaurant...

917
01:24:40,255 --> 01:24:42,189
...with Sunny, Pinky and Sonia.

918
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,382
And I saw my first client there.

919
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:48,523
Then?
- Then nothing happened.

920
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:51,191
But till when, will I hide
my past like this?

921
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:54,195
And I do not want anything
should happen...

922
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:56,601
...to those nice people
because of me.

923
01:24:57,939 --> 01:24:59,201
Then what do you want?

924
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:02,366
Before our interview I do not want...

925
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:04,935
...that Shandalya family should
know of my true identity.

926
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:07,714
And what after the interview?

927
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:10,377
I'll bear whatever happens
after the interview.

928
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:16,883
Till then please take me
away from this place.

929
01:25:20,295 --> 01:25:23,560
We can do one thing. My
friend has a farm house.

930
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:26,226
Until the interview is
over you stay there.

931
01:25:26,301 --> 01:25:28,428
I will also stay with you. Okay?

932
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:32,739
Would you like to have a cigarette?

933
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:35,640
You know I'm still astonished
by one thing.

934
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:38,404
According to the age, Neel
being in your life...

935
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,471
...was not much surprising.

936
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:42,742
And working together coming
closer to Rohan...

937
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:44,809
...was obvious in a kind.

938
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,585
But you meeting Mihir and that too...

939
01:25:48,657 --> 01:25:50,648
...when you were already a call girl?

940
01:26:06,341 --> 01:26:09,936
'What is not thought
of, it happens.'

941
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:14,613
'What is not thought of,
it does not happens.'

942
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:19,446
'You are like the rock
on the street.'

943
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:23,884
'Lost somewhere in dark streets.'

944
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:26,621
'Julie! '

945
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:44,368
Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

946
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:46,907
You have to go to Delhi today.
- Delhi?

947
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:49,910
He is a big minister.

948
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:53,539
Actually the client is someone
else who is paying.

949
01:27:53,648 --> 01:27:57,106
But he will utilize it.
- Why?

950
01:27:57,452 --> 01:27:59,784
This client is a very
old customer of mine.

951
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:01,879
He is honest. Even the
men he sends are okay.

952
01:28:02,123 --> 01:28:04,387
He will come in the morning
himself to pay you.

953
01:28:39,094 --> 01:28:40,755
Greetings sir!
- Greetings!

954
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,501
Is this room no. 450?

955
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:03,567
You please check it
with the reception.

956
01:31:24,656 --> 01:31:26,146
Who is it?

957
01:31:26,658 --> 01:31:29,320
If you have come to give the money,
just keep it there.

958
01:32:00,525 --> 01:32:03,858
Wait! Neel! Why do you turn away?

959
01:32:04,696 --> 01:32:08,530
You had turned away from me
the day, you trapped Briganza.

960
01:32:09,534 --> 01:32:11,195
Why are you faltering now?

961
01:32:11,703 --> 01:32:14,194
You had fixed my cost that day, too.

962
01:32:14,539 --> 01:32:16,200
Raise your head and see, Neel!

963
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:19,541
Is the price that you
set correct or not!

964
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:25,213
My name rings good on
your lips even today.

965
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,211
The only difference is that I used...

966
01:32:27,385 --> 01:32:29,876
...to yearn to listen to
it some years back.

967
01:32:29,955 --> 01:32:31,547
And today... I pity it today, Neel.

968
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:35,553
You have chosen a straight
and simple road to success.

969
01:32:35,627 --> 01:32:37,561
And coincidentally,
I met you there too.

970
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:40,228
Let us celebrate success!

971
01:32:41,566 --> 01:32:43,227
Lift your eyes and look, Neel!

972
01:32:43,568 --> 01:32:45,900
This naked body of your lover.

973
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:49,233
Which was bought with your money
last night by someone.

974
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:53,741
Do you remember?

975
01:32:53,912 --> 01:32:58,246
I used to say that I'd be
happy in a small house.

976
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:02,747
I would run the house
in what you earn.

977
01:33:03,588 --> 01:33:06,580
If it would be less, I will
run the bakery, too.

978
01:33:07,759 --> 01:33:09,920
And you were angry with
me at that time, Neel.

979
01:33:10,595 --> 01:33:13,758
And today, this bakery of my
body was used by you, Neel!

980
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,263
There is a fire in my body, and
you are eating the biscuit?

981
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,272
Neel, I will wish you
that you give me...

982
01:33:24,442 --> 01:33:27,275
...the cash that you brought
in my hands with love.

983
01:33:27,445 --> 01:33:29,436
Because, I had a dream. Neel.

984
01:33:29,614 --> 01:33:33,277
That you would earn and keep
the earning in my hands.

985
01:33:34,452 --> 01:33:37,785
I will keep that earning in my
hands with the same happiness.

986
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,623
So what if you have earned
it by selling me?

987
01:34:06,484 --> 01:34:08,645
Did you get your room?
- Yes.

988
01:34:32,844 --> 01:34:34,004
How are you?

989
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,515
I am well! How is brother?
Is everything all right?

990
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:55,859
It is an official bachelor party.

991
01:34:56,034 --> 01:34:58,366
That too it is in honor
of our Ketan's marriage.

992
01:34:58,703 --> 01:35:02,696
All I know is that there will
be high-class girls there.

993
01:35:02,774 --> 01:35:05,368
Of international standards!
It will be fun.

994
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:08,034
I do not like this concept
of bachelor parties.

995
01:35:08,113 --> 01:35:09,876
All I know is...

996
01:35:09,948 --> 01:35:15,716
First class liquor and first
class dance. And after that!

997
01:35:15,787 --> 01:35:18,119
All of us will drown and
die! It will be fun!

998
01:35:18,189 --> 01:35:20,555
See, you drown and die,
I won't come.

999
01:35:21,559 --> 01:35:23,550
The question of death doesn't arise.

1000
01:35:23,728 --> 01:35:27,721
If you are so afraid, you
wear a cap and come.

1001
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:30,063
I do not want to come
in this sex fair.

1002
01:35:30,735 --> 01:35:35,900
You do not understand. A man can
stay a bachelor all through his life.

1003
01:35:35,974 --> 01:35:38,909
This virginity and all
is just for women!

1004
01:35:38,977 --> 01:35:40,069
Still, I won't come.

1005
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:41,909
Whether you come or not.

1006
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,414
I will send two hot chicks for you.

1007
01:35:44,582 --> 01:35:46,413
You people are mad!

1008
01:35:46,751 --> 01:35:49,083
I will come, but I will
meet Ketan and go.

1009
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:51,415
That's it!

1010
01:36:38,636 --> 01:36:43,471
' Love is acid, God! '

1011
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:47,975
' Love is acid, God! '

1012
01:36:57,822 --> 01:37:03,488
' It burns! It burns! It burns! '

1013
01:37:22,847 --> 01:37:25,509
' It is acid! '

1014
01:37:25,683 --> 01:37:27,514
' It is acid! '

1015
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,724
' Please cool my heart.'

1016
01:38:16,901 --> 01:38:21,565
'You are icy, what a boy are you? '

1017
01:38:26,911 --> 01:38:31,575
' But there is fire! '

1018
01:39:27,138 --> 01:39:32,132
' If there are blots on the veil... '

1019
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:39,309
'They do not go, they do not go.'

1020
01:39:44,822 --> 01:39:49,657
' It is those blots, those
blots and those blots.'

1021
01:40:45,883 --> 01:40:48,215
Thief! Thief!

1022
01:41:22,086 --> 01:41:28,082
That! That! He stole my purse!

1023
01:41:32,263 --> 01:41:34,254
Please do not worry.
I will drop you home.

1024
01:41:34,332 --> 01:41:35,765
Please come.

1025
01:41:49,113 --> 01:41:51,946
By the way, my name is Mihir.
- I am Julie.

1026
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:01,121
Please go home and ring the bell.

1027
01:42:01,192 --> 01:42:03,456
Everyone must be sleeping. When
the lights are on, I will go.

1028
01:42:06,297 --> 01:42:07,787
What happened?

1029
01:42:08,533 --> 01:42:10,125
The keys were in the purse.

1030
01:42:10,201 --> 01:42:12,795
Oh, so you live alone?

1031
01:42:13,538 --> 01:42:15,802
See, if you say so, I will
drop you to your friends...

1032
01:42:15,973 --> 01:42:18,806
...or your relatives or
a girl friend's house.

1033
01:42:18,976 --> 01:42:20,807
No. Please leave.

1034
01:42:21,979 --> 01:42:23,139
How?

1035
01:42:23,981 --> 01:42:27,314
It is not a problem. Half
the night has passed.

1036
01:42:27,485 --> 01:42:29,476
And it is just the matter
of a couple of hours.

1037
01:42:29,987 --> 01:42:31,818
I will spend the night
sitting all-alone.

1038
01:42:32,156 --> 01:42:34,317
I will catch some key
maker in the morning.

1039
01:42:37,161 --> 01:42:39,994
Do not you think that it is a
boring and ambitious plan?

1040
01:42:41,165 --> 01:42:42,826
No.

1041
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:49,332
I have a habit to spend
nights outside.

1042
01:42:50,341 --> 01:42:52,332
Okay, it seems that you
are a regular partygoer.

1043
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:56,343
It may be that you are accustomed
to spend nights outside.

1044
01:42:56,414 --> 01:43:00,510
But if I leave you alone like this,
it will seem manner less.

1045
01:43:02,186 --> 01:43:05,019
I will wait here. I will leave
when you get a key maker.

1046
01:43:06,357 --> 01:43:08,848
You have already done
so much for me.

1047
01:43:09,193 --> 01:43:10,854
Why are you taking more trouble, now?

1048
01:43:11,529 --> 01:43:15,863
Trouble? No. I want to
share your trouble.

1049
01:43:17,201 --> 01:43:19,192
And that too without giving
you any trouble.

1050
01:43:23,374 --> 01:43:24,864
See, I am still telling you.

1051
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:28,204
Why are you ruining your
sleep for me needlessly?

1052
01:43:29,213 --> 01:43:31,204
Why do you not go home
and sleep peacefully?

1053
01:43:33,384 --> 01:43:35,875
What kind of a person am I
that I sat with you here?

1054
01:43:36,053 --> 01:43:37,884
You can come to my house.

1055
01:43:39,056 --> 01:43:41,217
Me?

1056
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:43,385
I am sorry, I can't stay
at a stranger's place.

1057
01:43:43,461 --> 01:43:45,224
Then, in some hotel?
- Why?

1058
01:43:46,063 --> 01:43:48,896
If someone loses her keys or purse...

1059
01:43:49,066 --> 01:43:51,899
...do the hotels let
her stay in free?

1060
01:43:57,408 --> 01:43:59,239
It is not the matter of money.

1061
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:03,403
As it is, I do not like
staying in hotels.

1062
01:44:21,265 --> 01:44:23,927
Instead of spending this night
silently like this...

1063
01:44:24,101 --> 01:44:25,932
...why do not we go and
roam around a bit?

1064
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:28,932
We won't be sleepy due
to the walking...

1065
01:44:29,106 --> 01:44:30,937
...and we will know each other
better due to this meeting.

1066
01:44:34,111 --> 01:44:37,103
Would you have a problem in
increasing our friendship like this?

1067
01:44:43,454 --> 01:44:46,946
Like that, our meeting is
a serial of coincidences.

1068
01:44:47,124 --> 01:44:49,957
It's good that it's only
three to four episodes.

1069
01:44:52,296 --> 01:44:55,959
What do you do for a living?
- Is it necessary to tell?

1070
01:44:57,134 --> 01:44:58,965
It's not necessary to hide, too.

1071
01:45:02,306 --> 01:45:07,972
What a woman does. But not
what every woman can do.

1072
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:10,977
You do not want to say.

1073
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,982
Anyway, without your asking, I
will like to tell you that...

1074
01:45:15,152 --> 01:45:16,483
I know.

1075
01:45:16,554 --> 01:45:17,987
I have read it in India Today.

1076
01:45:19,156 --> 01:45:20,987
That was a small profile.

1077
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,491
But it was enough to know a man.

1078
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:28,662
Even then, you thought
me to be a stranger?

1079
01:45:30,167 --> 01:45:32,158
We know someone with information.

1080
01:45:32,737 --> 01:45:35,001
It will be wrong to say that
we recognize him, isn't it?

1081
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:37,333
That's right.

1082
01:45:38,175 --> 01:45:41,008
Will you sit on the buggy?
- Why?

1083
01:45:41,345 --> 01:45:43,006
Are you tired in four steps?

1084
01:45:43,681 --> 01:45:45,342
It is right too.

1085
01:45:45,416 --> 01:45:48,010
People like you do not get
many chances to walk.

1086
01:45:50,354 --> 01:45:53,517
It is not the question
of tiring or chance.

1087
01:45:54,525 --> 01:45:56,117
It is the question of a penchant.

1088
01:45:57,194 --> 01:45:58,684
I like to ride buggies.

1089
01:46:10,374 --> 01:46:14,037
Such cards were written
outside a church in Goa.

1090
01:46:14,378 --> 01:46:18,371
It was my hobby to note
them in a diary.

1091
01:46:19,383 --> 01:46:21,044
So you write a diary, too?

1092
01:46:21,786 --> 01:46:23,378
I used to write it.

1093
01:46:26,223 --> 01:46:29,056
Simple alphabets change positions...

1094
01:46:29,226 --> 01:46:31,057
...and new words are formed.

1095
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:37,064
I can surely tell
you that you like...

1096
01:46:37,234 --> 01:46:40,397
...a river, that means a water
or with a sea shore.

1097
01:46:41,405 --> 01:46:42,736
How did you know this?

1098
01:46:42,807 --> 01:46:45,571
I even know that you do poetry too.
Do not you write poetry too?

1099
01:46:46,811 --> 01:46:49,575
Your expressive face,
your writing a diary...

1100
01:46:49,647 --> 01:46:52,081
All this is a symbol of a
transparent personality.

1101
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:55,074
If I tell you to come to a beach.

1102
01:46:55,252 --> 01:46:57,743
You won't be ready on one
foot, but half a foot.

1103
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:37,120
I have come on a beach
after so many days!

1104
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:40,453
Hey, what is this? You have
still worn shoes and come!

1105
01:47:40,531 --> 01:47:42,123
I brought your sandals too.

1106
01:47:47,471 --> 01:47:49,803
Are these formalities needed still?

1107
01:47:54,478 --> 01:47:56,639
Do you know?

1108
01:47:56,714 --> 01:48:00,650
You seemed like a sculpture
out of these rocks from afar.

1109
01:48:00,718 --> 01:48:03,152
And these rocks which are dark now...

1110
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:06,153
...will change their color become
red like hot iron and...

1111
01:48:06,323 --> 01:48:08,655
...they will become bright like gold.

1112
01:48:10,327 --> 01:48:13,160
And if you stand here at that time,
it will seem like a gold...

1113
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:17,494
...fish colored mermaid has
stood out of the water.

1114
01:48:19,336 --> 01:48:23,670
Have you heard that story?
- Story? Which one?

1115
01:48:25,342 --> 01:48:26,502
There was princess.

1116
01:48:26,577 --> 01:48:29,171
The princess was cursed
and she became a mermaid.

1117
01:48:31,348 --> 01:48:33,179
Because she was a
mermaid she could...

1118
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:36,183
...meet her lover only at
night by the sea shore.

1119
01:48:38,355 --> 01:48:40,186
But there was another
problem in all this...

1120
01:48:40,357 --> 01:48:42,188
...which was very difficult
for the two lovers.

1121
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,520
What was that?

1122
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:50,193
The mermaid returning after
the sunrise to the river.

1123
01:48:52,536 --> 01:48:56,199
When I saw you here, I felt
for a moment that you were...

1124
01:48:56,373 --> 01:48:59,536
...the same mermaid who was
with me since last night.

1125
01:49:00,711 --> 01:49:05,205
And now, you are waiting
to return before sunrise.

1126
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:09,212
Why are you silent?

1127
01:49:09,386 --> 01:49:11,217
Do you not like my talks?

1128
01:49:11,388 --> 01:49:14,221
Or are you thinking
what am I blabbering?

1129
01:49:15,559 --> 01:49:17,220
I have tried to look into your past.

1130
01:49:17,394 --> 01:49:19,225
You did not like it?

1131
01:49:33,744 --> 01:49:35,234
What happened?

1132
01:49:35,412 --> 01:49:39,246
I was thinking, the mermaid
that you are searching for...

1133
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:43,409
...if she left you like this,
what would you do?

1134
01:49:43,487 --> 01:49:45,250
India's most eligible
bachelor will be...

1135
01:49:45,422 --> 01:49:47,754
...the most listless lover.

1136
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:03,599
And you?

1137
01:50:04,441 --> 01:50:05,601
Me...

1138
01:50:06,777 --> 01:50:11,271
I am not a mermaid and neither
do I want to meet anyone.

1139
01:50:11,782 --> 01:50:13,272
And I do not want to
think about it, too.

1140
01:50:14,618 --> 01:50:16,279
Till when?

1141
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:19,282
At least till this sunrise,
I will not...

1142
01:50:19,456 --> 01:50:22,289
...think about anything
else. And please...

1143
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:25,292
...you do not think about it too.
- Why?

1144
01:50:25,796 --> 01:50:28,287
Why? Because the day you
get the right girl...

1145
01:50:28,465 --> 01:50:30,456
...you will propose her right away.

1146
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:34,971
Think this to be face reading,
wild guessing or just kidding.

1147
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:37,473
But this is what will happen.

1148
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:49,642
My papa always tells me...

1149
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,314
The thought that exists in our
heart during the sunrise...

1150
01:50:52,489 --> 01:50:55,322
...that lights up like
the sun very lightly.

1151
01:50:55,492 --> 01:50:58,825
...and settles on our heart
soul and all over our life.

1152
01:51:09,506 --> 01:51:10,666
Give me two hundred rupees.

1153
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:11,833
Two hundred rupees...

1154
01:51:11,909 --> 01:51:14,002
Only twenty rupees for
making the keys.

1155
01:51:14,078 --> 01:51:15,340
And the rest one hundred
and eighty rupees...

1156
01:51:15,512 --> 01:51:18,003
...to remind you to keep
the key carefully.

1157
01:51:19,683 --> 01:51:21,844
Hail Malang!

1158
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:38,691
Sister-in-law said that you
did not come home last night?

1159
01:51:38,769 --> 01:51:41,363
It was Ketan's bachelor party,
isn't it? I went there.

1160
01:51:41,705 --> 01:51:44,367
Since when did you start getting
involved in these bachelor parties?

1161
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:47,700
Is your bachelorhood a
burden on you? - No!

1162
01:51:50,114 --> 01:51:51,479
Did you see brother's e-mail?

1163
01:51:51,548 --> 01:51:52,708
Did papa e-mail?

1164
01:51:53,717 --> 01:51:55,378
This means that the
party was fabulous.

1165
01:51:56,053 --> 01:51:57,714
There will be another party soon.

1166
01:51:57,788 --> 01:52:00,382
Did the London deal finalize?
- That will be done.

1167
01:52:01,558 --> 01:52:03,048
Do you know Mr. Patel from London?

1168
01:52:03,127 --> 01:52:04,890
What about him?
- Not about him.

1169
01:52:06,563 --> 01:52:08,053
His daughter.

1170
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:10,396
He wants to give his daughter
in the Shandalya family.

1171
01:52:11,068 --> 01:52:12,729
You see Papa's e-mail.

1172
01:52:12,803 --> 01:52:16,739
There is that girl's photo and
profile. If you say yes...

1173
01:52:16,807 --> 01:52:17,899
Then?

1174
01:52:17,975 --> 01:52:19,738
Your friends will get
another bachelor party.

1175
01:53:02,786 --> 01:53:04,447
Because the day you
get the right girl...

1176
01:53:04,621 --> 01:53:06,452
...you will propose her
that, day itself.

1177
01:53:06,623 --> 01:53:08,454
Whether you think of
it as face reading...

1178
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:10,786
...wild guessing or just
kidding, joking.

1179
01:53:10,861 --> 01:53:12,453
But this is what will happen.

1180
01:53:22,806 --> 01:53:24,467
You?

1181
01:53:25,642 --> 01:53:26,802
Yes, me.

1182
01:53:27,811 --> 01:53:30,473
You said last night that
I would propose...

1183
01:53:30,647 --> 01:53:33,480
...the girl the day I find
some proper girl.

1184
01:53:33,984 --> 01:53:35,474
Will you marry me?

1185
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:45,489
Julie, Julie

1186
01:53:45,829 --> 01:53:49,822
You are that right girl. I have
fallen in love with you.

1187
01:53:53,837 --> 01:53:57,000
No, I told you that I
am asking seriously.

1188
01:53:57,841 --> 01:54:00,674
I want an answer.

1189
01:54:04,681 --> 01:54:06,512
What answer should I give?

1190
01:54:07,851 --> 01:54:10,513
I know what answer you want.

1191
01:54:12,022 --> 01:54:15,514
Love and marriage is not
a one-night stand for me.

1192
01:54:16,693 --> 01:54:18,524
I know everything about you.

1193
01:54:21,698 --> 01:54:23,529
But what do you know about me?

1194
01:54:25,702 --> 01:54:28,535
All I know about you now is that
I have fallen in love with you.

1195
01:54:29,706 --> 01:54:31,537
And that I want to marry you.

1196
01:54:35,712 --> 01:54:38,545
Julie, who you are, what you do...

1197
01:54:38,715 --> 01:54:41,548
...how you live, you caste religion...

1198
01:54:41,718 --> 01:54:44,050
...your economic status, all
this is secondary for me.

1199
01:54:45,289 --> 01:54:49,055
All I know is that my wish is true.

1200
01:54:49,126 --> 01:54:50,218
And it is heartfelt.

1201
01:54:50,294 --> 01:54:51,886
I am sure that it will be fulfilled.

1202
01:54:54,731 --> 01:54:57,564
My wish and my love are growing
in my heart while sunrise.

1203
01:55:17,754 --> 01:55:19,244
What is going on, Tara?

1204
01:55:19,323 --> 01:55:21,587
The promos are to be telecast
from tomorrow.

1205
01:55:21,758 --> 01:55:23,089
What are you doing?

1206
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,594
I had told you that day
that there is no need...

1207
01:55:25,762 --> 01:55:28,595
...to shoot news promos. The promos...

1208
01:55:28,765 --> 01:55:30,596
...that we have shot are right
according to marketing.

1209
01:55:30,934 --> 01:55:32,595
We have shown these promos and...

1210
01:55:32,769 --> 01:55:34,600
...got advertisements.
Now, if we stop...

1211
01:55:34,771 --> 01:55:36,602
...showing these promos and show...

1212
01:55:36,773 --> 01:55:38,263
...some other promos the clients...

1213
01:55:38,342 --> 01:55:39,934
...will do 'stop
- payment.'

1214
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:41,602
Do you know what
loss this channel...

1215
01:55:41,778 --> 01:55:43,939
...will face due to this
action of yours?

1216
01:55:44,014 --> 01:55:46,608
Are you just thinking about
your commercial loss?

1217
01:55:46,783 --> 01:55:49,274
But our channel is not just
commercially viable.

1218
01:55:49,353 --> 01:55:52,618
It has creditability and
a social responsibility.

1219
01:55:52,956 --> 01:55:55,618
It should not be that by selling a...

1220
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:58,625
...woman who sells her flesh, we...

1221
01:55:58,795 --> 01:56:01,127
...to earn money like a pimp does.

1222
01:56:09,806 --> 01:56:12,639
I have sent my objection
to the promo director.

1223
01:56:14,978 --> 01:56:17,640
When it is the matter
of the company...

1224
01:56:17,814 --> 01:56:19,645
...decision, one's words are
not important in that.

1225
01:56:27,157 --> 01:56:30,649
The promos that we shot
earlier will be telecast.

1226
01:56:48,011 --> 01:56:49,672
I am Julie.

1227
01:56:49,846 --> 01:56:51,677
Did you recognize me? No?

1228
01:56:52,849 --> 01:56:56,683
It is possible that your daddy,
brother or boy friend...

1229
01:56:56,853 --> 01:56:59,344
...or your husband met me somewhere.
He did not tell you?

1230
01:57:00,023 --> 01:57:01,684
How will he tell you?

1231
01:57:01,858 --> 01:57:03,348
Because I am a call girl.

1232
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:06,852
People say that I sell flesh.

1233
01:57:07,864 --> 01:57:10,697
The truth is that I buy manhood.

1234
01:57:11,034 --> 01:57:13,696
And that too, not by paying,
but taking payment.

1235
01:57:14,871 --> 01:57:16,202
What kind of trading is this?

1236
01:57:16,873 --> 01:57:18,704
Find out with me this week.

1237
01:57:19,042 --> 01:57:20,202
I am Julie.

1238
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,711
I am reaching there.

1239
01:57:27,217 --> 01:57:28,707
Someone calls me Radha.

1240
01:57:28,885 --> 01:57:30,216
Someone calls me Meera.

1241
01:57:30,287 --> 01:57:31,720
Someone calls me Tulsi.

1242
01:57:32,055 --> 01:57:35,718
What is my real recognition?
I am Julie.

1243
02:00:15,051 --> 02:00:16,211
Welcome to C TV.

1244
02:00:16,286 --> 02:00:18,880
In a while, the most talked about
talk show will be aired.

1245
02:00:19,055 --> 02:00:20,886
Coming to the point.

1246
02:00:21,224 --> 02:00:23,385
This talk show stayed as a point
of discussion last week.

1247
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:27,055
Julie will come to you
in some time now.

1248
02:00:29,232 --> 02:00:30,893
Greetings.

1249
02:00:31,234 --> 02:00:35,568
Welcome to the historic live
episode of this show.

1250
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:38,904
I know that there is a lot of
criticism about this show.

1251
02:00:39,075 --> 02:00:40,906
As far as our social and
professional commitment...

1252
02:00:41,077 --> 02:00:42,908
...or responsibility is concerned...

1253
02:00:43,079 --> 02:00:44,569
...we are very much clear about it.

1254
02:00:44,648 --> 02:00:46,912
The guest of 'Coming
to the point' today...

1255
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:49,244
...is not like our everyday guests.

1256
02:00:49,419 --> 02:00:51,910
She has her own introduction.

1257
02:00:52,255 --> 02:00:54,416
And this introduction has
brought her till here.

1258
02:00:55,091 --> 02:00:57,924
So please, ladies and gentlemen,
let us welcome...

1259
02:00:58,094 --> 02:01:00,426
...the famous, Julie.

1260
02:01:02,265 --> 02:01:03,926
Greetings.

1261
02:01:08,104 --> 02:01:09,935
As you all know.

1262
02:01:10,273 --> 02:01:13,936
You must have seen
in our program ads.

1263
02:01:14,277 --> 02:01:16,939
Julie is a call girl.

1264
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,941
She is a prostitute.

1265
02:01:20,116 --> 02:01:22,107
Even prostitutes have
their own lives.

1266
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:25,952
But is Julie or thousands of girls...

1267
02:01:26,122 --> 02:01:28,955
...like Julie not like our sisters,
daughters or wives?

1268
02:01:29,292 --> 02:01:31,453
Can she not become someone's wife?

1269
02:01:32,462 --> 02:01:34,623
Can she not become someone's mother?

1270
02:01:35,298 --> 02:01:37,459
Will we give her that right?

1271
02:01:38,301 --> 02:01:40,963
Julie has come to know, to ask some...

1272
02:01:41,137 --> 02:01:44,300
...questions, tell some
truths and some myths.

1273
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:52,975
I want to thank Tara and her
co-workers first of all.

1274
02:01:53,483 --> 02:01:55,474
For giving me this chance.

1275
02:01:55,652 --> 02:01:58,314
I do not know whether what I
am doing is right or wrong.

1276
02:01:59,322 --> 02:02:02,985
But it is not like what
some people think.

1277
02:02:03,326 --> 02:02:06,989
That this is a trick to earn
money in a wrong way.

1278
02:02:09,165 --> 02:02:14,000
How much I can think,
what is in my mind...

1279
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:19,005
...and the questions that
stand in my mind...

1280
02:02:19,175 --> 02:02:24,511
...they may be personal, but
you are a part of them, too.

1281
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:31,184
The questions are personal. But
they are connected to society.

1282
02:02:32,355 --> 02:02:35,017
Therefore I want to tolerate
the reactions...

1283
02:02:35,191 --> 02:02:38,024
...of the society before
and not after.

1284
02:02:59,382 --> 02:03:04,547
A very successful and nice
and simple man loves me.

1285
02:03:05,388 --> 02:03:07,549
Like that, many people
love call girls.

1286
02:03:07,624 --> 02:03:12,061
But this is not love, he
wants to marry me, too.

1287
02:03:12,228 --> 02:03:15,061
Instead of knowing about my life...

1288
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:17,062
...or knowing anything
about my life...

1289
02:03:17,233 --> 02:03:19,064
...he talks a lot about other things.

1290
02:03:19,235 --> 02:03:21,066
Listening to his talks, it seems...

1291
02:03:21,237 --> 02:03:23,068
...that we do not know each
other since many years...

1292
02:03:23,239 --> 02:03:24,399
...but since many eras.

1293
02:03:26,242 --> 02:03:32,078
Separating him from me...

1294
02:03:38,421 --> 02:03:42,084
I am telling you all this because...

1295
02:03:42,258 --> 02:03:46,092
...the one who proposed
me is nobody else but...

1296
02:03:46,262 --> 02:03:49,425
...Mr. Mihir Shandalya.

1297
02:03:51,434 --> 02:03:55,097
The owner of Shandalya Industries.

1298
02:03:56,272 --> 02:03:58,604
He loves me and wishes to marry me.

1299
02:03:58,675 --> 02:04:01,610
This is a lie.
- This is wrong.

1300
02:04:01,678 --> 02:04:04,772
You should be ashamed
to muck someone's name!

1301
02:04:07,851 --> 02:04:10,615
Did not you know whom she
was going to name?

1302
02:04:21,464 --> 02:04:24,126
Please, please go
back to your seats.

1303
02:04:26,469 --> 02:04:28,130
So that I can say something too.

1304
02:04:30,306 --> 02:04:32,797
This is a live telecast going on.
We will not stop this show.

1305
02:04:32,876 --> 02:04:36,141
Let Julie stop speaking once. You
can ask her whatever you want.

1306
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:42,474
I do not have any information.
It has just come on the TV.

1307
02:04:42,652 --> 02:04:45,143
No, there is no news from
the Shandilya family too.

1308
02:04:45,488 --> 02:04:47,149
We will see!

1309
02:04:51,494 --> 02:04:53,655
I am constable Pawar from
Andheri Police station.

1310
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:57,666
I am Naidu from CTV. I need some
police force in my studio.

1311
02:04:58,334 --> 02:04:59,824
Yes, there is some tension here.

1312
02:04:59,903 --> 02:05:01,666
You will have to lodge
a registered complaint.

1313
02:05:01,738 --> 02:05:03,831
Just a minute. Speak to sir.

1314
02:05:26,362 --> 02:05:30,196
The live telecast of the much
talked about talk show...

1315
02:05:30,366 --> 02:05:32,197
'Coming to the point' is going on.

1316
02:05:32,368 --> 02:05:35,201
In that, a call girl named
Julie has said...

1317
02:05:35,371 --> 02:05:38,204
...that the chairman to Shandilya
Group of Companies...

1318
02:05:38,374 --> 02:05:41,207
...Mr. Mihir Shandilya
not only loves her...

1319
02:05:41,377 --> 02:05:44,210
...but also wishes to marry
her. After Julie...

1320
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:46,871
...has said this, this program
has been stopped.

1321
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:51,216
To know the reason behind the
stopping of this program...

1322
02:05:51,387 --> 02:05:53,878
...we will go to our correspondent
Meenaxi...

1323
02:05:53,957 --> 02:05:55,219
...who is present there.
Yes, Meenaxi...

1324
02:05:55,391 --> 02:05:57,222
...what is going on there right now?

1325
02:05:59,395 --> 02:06:01,886
The main gate of the
studio is closed.

1326
02:06:01,965 --> 02:06:03,899
Even the police had come
Here, a while ago.

1327
02:06:03,967 --> 02:06:05,901
There is news that there is
an interruption in the telecast.

1328
02:06:05,969 --> 02:06:08,233
But a caption is being
shown on the TV...

1329
02:06:08,404 --> 02:06:10,235
...that the live telecast
will be started again...

1330
02:06:10,406 --> 02:06:13,898
Did you talk about this with any
channel members or Tara Aggrawal?

1331
02:06:13,977 --> 02:06:16,468
No. Vishal. Nobody is
allowed to go inside.

1332
02:06:16,546 --> 02:06:17,911
And there is nobody available
on the phone too.

1333
02:06:17,981 --> 02:06:20,245
Is there any news of any
riot or threat there?

1334
02:06:21,584 --> 02:06:23,575
No. Vishal, there is
no news like that.

1335
02:07:01,624 --> 02:07:03,785
We have come to know that the
car has left the airport.

1336
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:05,293
It will come home, isn't it?
- We do not know.

1337
02:07:05,461 --> 02:07:06,951
Please ask it over the intercom.

1338
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,622
We do not have permission.
- Shall we ask?

1339
02:07:08,798 --> 02:07:10,288
Mihir Shandilya's
love story showed...

1340
02:07:10,466 --> 02:07:12,457
...it's color on the
share market today.

1341
02:07:12,535 --> 02:07:14,298
We have got news of a major jump...

1342
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:16,301
...in the shares of the
companies related to...

1343
02:07:16,472 --> 02:07:17,962
...the Shandilya Group.

1344
02:07:18,041 --> 02:07:19,975
The market has broken it's
silence after hours.

1345
02:07:20,043 --> 02:07:21,408
The market watchers have told that...

1346
02:07:21,477 --> 02:07:23,308
...it is for the first time
that a social issue...

1347
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:25,310
...has raised a question
in the market.

1348
02:07:28,484 --> 02:07:30,475
Due to some instant reactions...

1349
02:07:30,553 --> 02:07:32,316
...due to Julie's confessions,
we had...

1350
02:07:32,488 --> 02:07:34,319
...to put the show off
air for some time.

1351
02:07:34,657 --> 02:07:36,488
But we are back in the studio.

1352
02:07:36,559 --> 02:07:39,323
And we want to tell the people
watching outside...

1353
02:07:39,495 --> 02:07:42,328
...rather we want to request
them that this...

1354
02:07:42,498 --> 02:07:44,329
...is not a rumor or an exciting news.

1355
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:48,334
We just want to tell a story here.

1356
02:07:48,671 --> 02:07:52,334
Some of the names listed with
this story are big and famous.

1357
02:07:53,676 --> 02:07:56,338
But nobody is bigger than truth.

1358
02:07:57,513 --> 02:08:01,347
And all we want to
know is the truth.

1359
02:08:03,519 --> 02:08:06,352
If Julie is wrong, we
should be punished.

1360
02:08:06,522 --> 02:08:09,685
But there are legal and moral
ways for that punishment.

1361
02:08:11,694 --> 02:08:14,686
You said that Mihir
Shandilya loves you.

1362
02:08:14,764 --> 02:08:16,527
That he wants to marry you.

1363
02:08:16,699 --> 02:08:18,360
Is this matter just
between you two or...

1364
02:08:18,534 --> 02:08:20,365
His parents knew it.

1365
02:08:20,536 --> 02:08:21,867
So then what is the problem?

1366
02:08:21,938 --> 02:08:25,374
Nobody among them know my true form.

1367
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:27,702
Why did you not tell them
when you met them.

1368
02:08:27,777 --> 02:08:29,369
You should have told Mihir.

1369
02:08:29,545 --> 02:08:31,376
What was the need to stage
this drama here.

1370
02:08:31,547 --> 02:08:32,878
No need, helplessness.

1371
02:08:32,949 --> 02:08:34,041
What kind of helplessness?

1372
02:08:34,117 --> 02:08:39,384
Money, or did your father
have cancer too?

1373
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,393
You are worried and grumpy because...

1374
02:08:47,563 --> 02:08:49,394
...I took Mr. Mihir Shandilya's name.

1375
02:08:49,565 --> 02:08:52,398
You think about Mihir's status.

1376
02:08:52,568 --> 02:08:54,399
But one does not clap with one hand.

1377
02:08:54,737 --> 02:08:57,399
And if I had to earn money
I would not have come...

1378
02:08:57,573 --> 02:08:59,404
...here and made a farce of myself.

1379
02:09:01,911 --> 02:09:04,402
Mihir must be a big shot for you.

1380
02:09:07,917 --> 02:09:11,751
But he is a lover for me.

1381
02:09:13,089 --> 02:09:16,422
And there is nobody
small or big in love.

1382
02:09:18,761 --> 02:09:23,425
What people are calling
a farce now...

1383
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:26,432
...if I had taken any
one else's name...

1384
02:09:26,602 --> 02:09:28,934
...instead of Mihir, you people
would have searched for him.

1385
02:09:29,772 --> 02:09:32,104
And you would make him marry me.

1386
02:09:33,776 --> 02:09:36,438
Our photo would be printed
in the press.

1387
02:09:36,612 --> 02:09:39,945
Look at Mihir with my eyes.

1388
02:09:55,631 --> 02:09:59,624
Mihir Shandilya merciful
on mystery lover.

1389
02:10:03,639 --> 02:10:04,970
If it is the marriage
of rich people...

1390
02:10:05,041 --> 02:10:06,133
...we are the marriage procession.

1391
02:10:06,209 --> 02:10:09,804
If it is their ruination, we are in
the front liners in their mourning.

1392
02:10:11,814 --> 02:10:15,477
Let us see what Mr.
Shandilya does now.

1393
02:10:23,659 --> 02:10:28,494
Wherever you are, please forgive me.

1394
02:10:30,833 --> 02:10:33,495
If I had gone anywhere without...

1395
02:10:33,669 --> 02:10:35,500
...telling you anything,
you'd find me...

1396
02:10:35,671 --> 02:10:37,502
...out from any corner of the world.

1397
02:10:37,673 --> 02:10:40,506
And even if I told you anything...

1398
02:10:40,676 --> 02:10:43,668
...you would accept me
and keep me with you.

1399
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:47,615
Even if you would have to leave.

1400
02:10:47,683 --> 02:10:49,514
...your house and family for that.

1401
02:10:50,853 --> 02:10:52,514
You would have to water down the...

1402
02:10:52,688 --> 02:10:55,179
...money earned by your ancestors.

1403
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:00,522
Even then you would not accept it...

1404
02:11:00,696 --> 02:11:02,857
...and would stand stiff
on your stand to get me.

1405
02:11:04,867 --> 02:11:07,199
Fearing this adamancy,
I have come here.

1406
02:11:10,873 --> 02:11:14,536
What will be said here, that may...

1407
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:18,544
...build such a wall,
which maybe you...

1408
02:11:18,714 --> 02:11:21,547
...will never be able to cross.

1409
02:11:22,885 --> 02:11:25,547
In a marriage, not only do two...

1410
02:11:25,721 --> 02:11:27,552
...bodies come close,
their souls meet too.

1411
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:34,557
My soul had died when I sold
my body for the first time.

1412
02:11:34,897 --> 02:11:39,732
You were that companion, whom
I waited for since years.

1413
02:11:40,903 --> 02:11:45,897
You are that dream which, I
kept in my eyes with care.

1414
02:11:46,742 --> 02:11:52,078
After meeting you, I was
awakened once again.

1415
02:11:54,917 --> 02:11:57,579
The light of my eyes had
started returning.

1416
02:11:59,755 --> 02:12:03,589
I heard my heart beats after years.

1417
02:12:05,928 --> 02:12:10,262
I had a customer, who was a poet.

1418
02:12:11,934 --> 02:12:14,767
Poets are our obvious customers.

1419
02:12:16,939 --> 02:12:22,605
The prostitute to whom he
used to go to before me...

1420
02:12:22,778 --> 02:12:28,614
...he wanted to marry her.
The prostitute refused.

1421
02:12:30,786 --> 02:12:32,947
She told him the reasons, too.

1422
02:12:36,292 --> 02:12:38,624
That poet wrote a couplet on that.

1423
02:12:43,799 --> 02:12:47,633
That couplet isn't the story
of only those two...

1424
02:12:48,804 --> 02:12:50,965
...it is the story of
the two of us too.

1425
02:12:55,978 --> 02:12:58,640
From that story I want
to say something.

1426
02:13:00,983 --> 02:13:03,144
I will stop after what I want
to say with that couplet.

1427
02:13:11,994 --> 02:13:14,656
You and I both have glass houses.

1428
02:13:15,164 --> 02:13:17,655
Why do both of us have stones
in our hands then?

1429
02:13:20,002 --> 02:13:29,673
I will think, you think
too. Did not you know?

1430
02:13:32,014 --> 02:13:35,006
That the waves come and go.

1431
02:13:37,019 --> 02:13:42,355
Yet, why did you write
the name on the sand?

1432
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:49,695
You think, I will think too.

1433
02:13:53,035 --> 02:13:55,697
Why is it my sister
and daughter at home?

1434
02:13:57,039 --> 02:13:59,371
And some one else's in the market?

1435
02:14:02,044 --> 02:14:08,210
You think, and I will think too.

1436
02:14:39,915 --> 02:14:41,075
Brother?

1437
02:14:42,084 --> 02:14:43,745
He is here!

1438
02:14:43,919 --> 02:14:49,084
What is he doing here!

1439
02:14:51,927 --> 02:14:53,758
Our show has become a reality show.

1440
02:14:54,096 --> 02:14:58,760
Mr. Mihir Shandilya has walked
into our show, himself.

1441
02:15:13,949 --> 02:15:16,782
First of all, I will
wish to apologize...

1442
02:15:16,952 --> 02:15:19,785
...to Tara, her CEO Naidu
and all the crew members.

1443
02:15:19,955 --> 02:15:21,786
I will wish to thank them too.

1444
02:15:22,958 --> 02:15:24,289
I apologize to them because I came...

1445
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,452
...here without telling
them anything.

1446
02:15:25,528 --> 02:15:27,792
And I thank them because
they gave me...

1447
02:15:27,963 --> 02:15:30,796
...a chance to come here
and talk here, too.

1448
02:15:40,976 --> 02:15:43,467
It is true that I know Julie.

1449
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:48,973
Whatever Julie said, nothing
of it is false.

1450
02:15:50,152 --> 02:15:53,815
I love Julie and I
want to marry her.

1451
02:15:55,157 --> 02:15:57,819
It's true that I made Julie
meet my family members.

1452
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:01,823
Two days ago, I came know
in London what Julie does.

1453
02:16:03,999 --> 02:16:06,991
My family wanted me to stop
this show being telecast.

1454
02:16:07,069 --> 02:16:08,832
But I refused.

1455
02:16:10,172 --> 02:16:11,833
Because I had full faith in Julie.

1456
02:16:13,008 --> 02:16:15,841
I knew that she would not
be doing all this...

1457
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:17,842
...for money, publicity
or black mailing.

1458
02:16:20,182 --> 02:16:22,844
She must be having
some strong reason.

1459
02:16:23,018 --> 02:16:24,849
But I have a complaint
against Julie.

1460
02:16:26,021 --> 02:16:28,854
How did she think that after
expressing her love...

1461
02:16:29,024 --> 02:16:32,187
...so openly like this, she
will bid me farewell?

1462
02:16:32,261 --> 02:16:34,525
If I have loved, I will
have to fulfill it.

1463
02:16:37,032 --> 02:16:39,865
It doesn't matter to
me what Julie does...

1464
02:16:40,035 --> 02:16:41,866
...even after I know the reality
about what she does.

1465
02:16:42,037 --> 02:16:43,868
I love her.

1466
02:16:56,051 --> 02:16:58,542
Though Julie has talked
about being separated.

1467
02:16:58,621 --> 02:17:00,555
She has given her reasons too.

1468
02:17:01,557 --> 02:17:03,889
I have been thinking
since two days...

1469
02:17:04,059 --> 02:17:07,893
...that the girl that I
loved and was to marry

1470
02:17:08,063 --> 02:17:11,897
...does everything change after that?

1471
02:17:13,235 --> 02:17:14,896
Will we break relations
with her and...

1472
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:17,061
...and make her sit on the
same business again? :

1473
02:17:17,573 --> 02:17:19,905
And we will sit nicely in our house.

1474
02:17:20,576 --> 02:17:23,909
There will be talks within
yourselves for some days.

1475
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:25,910
The rich people have such passions!

1476
02:17:27,249 --> 02:17:29,240
He is trapped for some crores now.

1477
02:17:32,087 --> 02:17:33,418
A prostitute.

1478
02:17:33,489 --> 02:17:35,923
What is a prostitute? Where
does it come from?

1479
02:17:36,091 --> 02:17:38,423
It takes birth in this
society, isn't it?

1480
02:17:39,261 --> 02:17:40,922
Since eras, we have accepted it...

1481
02:17:41,096 --> 02:17:42,927
...that if there weren't
prostitutes in our...

1482
02:17:43,098 --> 02:17:45,259
...society, our sisters and
daughters -in-law would not be safe.

1483
02:17:45,334 --> 02:17:47,598
The rape cases in society
would increase.

1484
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:49,262
All of us would have
our houses ruined.

1485
02:17:50,272 --> 02:17:51,933
So, why do not we make our daughters
and daughters-in-law...

1486
02:17:52,107 --> 02:17:53,938
...prostitutes so that
our houses are safe?

1487
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:57,943
Just like our daughters become
doctors, nurses surgeons...

1488
02:17:58,113 --> 02:17:59,944
...why do not they
become prostitutes?

1489
02:18:00,282 --> 02:18:02,614
A prostitute is for social
Service, isn't it?

1490
02:18:03,619 --> 02:18:06,281
There are brothels in every
nook and cranny of the city.

1491
02:18:06,355 --> 02:18:07,947
There are call girls too.

1492
02:18:08,123 --> 02:18:12,287
We ruin so many girls lives
to keep our life progressed.

1493
02:18:12,361 --> 02:18:13,453
Why!

1494
02:18:13,529 --> 02:18:16,123
Is she not any one's mother,
sister, daughter?

1495
02:18:17,132 --> 02:18:19,965
According to me, the
biggest violence...

1496
02:18:20,135 --> 02:18:21,966
...in the world terrorism, is
to make a woman a prostitute.

1497
02:18:22,304 --> 02:18:25,967
To force her to live and
die as a prostitute.

1498
02:18:26,709 --> 02:18:31,976
Some person out of you had felt
worry for Shandilya family.

1499
02:18:34,316 --> 02:18:36,978
My family must be seeing it too.

1500
02:18:37,152 --> 02:18:38,983
I ask them, I ask all of you.

1501
02:18:39,321 --> 02:18:41,983
If Shandilya group of Companies...

1502
02:18:42,157 --> 02:18:45,991
...helps some institute that
helps prostitutes, you clap.

1503
02:18:48,330 --> 02:18:49,991
If Shandilya group of Companies...

1504
02:18:50,165 --> 02:18:51,996
...makes a group health
plan for prostitutes...

1505
02:18:52,167 --> 02:18:53,998
...distributes free condoms
for AIDS preventions...

1506
02:18:54,169 --> 02:18:56,000
...Mihir Shandilya gets
his photo printed...

1507
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:59,004
...on the front page
or on page three.

1508
02:19:01,343 --> 02:19:07,009
If the Shandilya group opens a
school for prostitute's children...

1509
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,515
It is such a strange thing.

1510
02:19:10,586 --> 02:19:12,019
We do not want a prostitute
in our house.

1511
02:19:12,187 --> 02:19:14,018
We want it in the society.

1512
02:19:15,357 --> 02:19:17,120
We will not take a prostitute
in to the house.

1513
02:19:17,192 --> 02:19:19,353
But we will open a charity
to raise her children.

1514
02:19:22,364 --> 02:19:24,696
We swallow wrong like sweets.

1515
02:19:27,202 --> 02:19:29,033
But it is difficult
to swallow the truth.

1516
02:19:31,206 --> 02:19:32,537
It is bitter.

1517
02:19:41,216 --> 02:19:44,049
The couplet which Julie
said in the end...

1518
02:19:44,219 --> 02:19:46,380
...I was answering her in my mind.

1519
02:19:47,389 --> 02:19:51,223
But I will give her that
answer in your presence.

1520
02:20:14,416 --> 02:20:17,078
Neither is my house made of glass...

1521
02:20:17,252 --> 02:20:19,083
...and neither do I have
a stone in my hand.

1522
02:20:19,254 --> 02:20:22,417
Our name is not something
written on the sand.

1523
02:20:23,425 --> 02:20:27,088
And neither do I want to keep
my sister and daughter...

1524
02:20:27,262 --> 02:20:29,253
. at home and want to see
anyone in a market.

1525
02:20:30,432 --> 02:20:34,095
As I wished earlier, just
like that, today too.

1526
02:20:34,603 --> 02:20:37,094
Julie, I wish to marry you.

1527
02:20:39,274 --> 02:20:41,105
You are mine.

1528
02:20:41,443 --> 02:20:43,104
And you will remain mine.

1529
02:20:43,445 --> 02:20:45,777
And this whole world
will be with me.

1530
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:55,283
Mummy, aunt, grandma, you
are watching, are not you?

1531
02:20:56,291 --> 02:20:59,124
I do think that I
have done anything...

1532
02:20:59,294 --> 02:21:02,127
...that has blotted the name
of the Shandilya family.

1533
02:21:02,464 --> 02:21:05,126
The decision that I
have taken today...

1534
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,131
...that has placed Shandilya's
family's social commitment...

1535
02:21:07,302 --> 02:21:09,133
...at a higher pedestal

1536
02:21:10,472 --> 02:21:15,136
Accepting my love, I have
decided to keep it alive.

1537
02:21:17,479 --> 02:21:22,143
All I want from you, is your
blessings and best wishes.

1538
02:21:59,354 --> 02:22:03,347
'The nights got a new morning.'

1539
02:22:03,425 --> 02:22:08,362
'The sorrows were lost, a
new happiness was found.'

1540
02:22:08,430 --> 02:22:13,197
'The dreams of love were true! '

1541
02:22:13,535 --> 02:22:18,199
'She blossomed, and become
aromatic like a flower.'
