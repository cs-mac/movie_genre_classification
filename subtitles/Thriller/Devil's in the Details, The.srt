00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,561
I mean, you don´t like it?

799
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:06,812
I like it fine. It´s beautiful.

800
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:08,854
It´s just....

801
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:11,902
It doesn´t belong to you.

802
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,897
JOHN: You´re too alive for a perm.

803
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:16,408
It´s not you.

804
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:19,361
You should pull your hair back.

805
00:45:21,873 --> 00:45:23,831
JOHN: Do it. See what happens.

806
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:26,491
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

807
00:45:26,587 --> 00:45:27,784
Is that so terrible?

808
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:28,958
[Mary Ann laughs]

809
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:30,838
I´d love to do it, but if I did...

810
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:33,794
...everyone in this room
who´s pretending not to be watching us...

811
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:37,420
...would naturally assume
that we were fucking or something.

812
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:42,055
Please.

813
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:48,103
Okay.

814
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,618
[Mary Ann sighs]

815
00:45:58,703 --> 00:46:00,279
It´s fun to be right.

816
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:05,290
CHRISTABELLA: Excuse me.

817
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:08,669
JOHN: That´s a vision.

818
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:12,792
You´ve gotta cut your hair.

819
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:17,011
Are you serious?

820
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:21,214
A woman´s shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

821
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:24,549
And her neck...

822
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,023
...if she´s alive...

823
00:46:29,901 --> 00:46:32,391
...has all the mystery of a border town.

824
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:36,696
A no man´s land...

825
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,654
...in that battle...

826
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,320
...between the mind and the body.

827
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,413
You know...

828
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,833
...your natural color would really...

829
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:51,748
...bring out your eyes.

830
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:08,432
Do you have this view?

831
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:10,520
Sorry?

832
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,649
From your terrace, is this your view?

833
00:47:14,446 --> 00:47:15,857
Not exactly.

834
00:47:16,615 --> 00:47:18,442
No terrace and l´m about...

835
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,528
...twelve floors down.

836
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,911
KEVIN: What about you?

837
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:25,205
No, I live downtown.

838
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:27,704
This is a...

839
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,502
...family building.

840
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,124
Sounds like fun.

841
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,676
Downtown, I mean.

842
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,138
KEVIN: l´m just getting to know the city.

843
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:41,214
Is it everything you expected?

844
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:42,886
More.

845
00:47:43,142 --> 00:47:46,179
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

846
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,551
[Jackie giggles]

847
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:50,648
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

848
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,892
JACKIE: No, l´m sure he´s around.

849
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:57,107
Are you alone?

850
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:01,904
You mean, tonight?

851
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,704
Is your wife a jealous woman?

852
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,924
Oh, dear, l´m going to scare you away.

853
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,381
No, really...

854
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,633
...l´m fine.

855
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:21,554
CHRISTABELLA: Yeah?
KEVIN: l´m fine.

856
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,218
Bet you like to be on top.

857
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,550
-Don´t you?
-Excuse me?

858
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,929
Of the situation.

859
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:30,846
You prefer to be on top, right?

860
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,193
Depends on the view.

861
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,859
You know what I see?

862
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:42,326
I see the future...

863
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:44,656
...of this law firm.

864
00:48:44,746 --> 00:48:46,289
[John cackles]

865
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,793
[John and Christabella speak in ltalian]

866
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,343
Ciao.

867
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,428
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something´s come up.

868
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:08,266
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

869
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,269
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

870
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:13,438
Quickly.

871
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:18,239
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

872
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,611
We´ll plant a story
and destroy his credibility.

873
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,111
Have you seen Kevin?

874
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:24,823
PAM: No, I haven´t, sweetie.
MARY ANN: Okay.

875
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:28,070
If he doesn´t come to us, he´ll regret it.

876
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:34,171
[John converses in Russian
with another man over speaker phone]

877
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,766
Come on.

878
00:49:51,106 --> 00:49:54,724
[John continues conversing over speaker
phone]

879
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:03,777
KEVIN: ls there more to it?

880
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:05,947
Just this room.

881
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,032
KEVIN: And a bedroom?

882
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,335
EDDIE: No bedroom.

883
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,787
-Where does he sleep?
-Who says he sleeps?

884
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,126
Where does he fuck?

885
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:17,626
JOHN: Everywhere!

886
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:19,967
[John cackles]

887
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,589
What´s up, John?

888
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:25,256
JOHN: How many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

889
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:29,469
16,242.

890
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:31,104
What did he do now?

891
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:35,433
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

892
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:37,694
...her stepson...

893
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:39,232
...and a maid.

894
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,272
When did this happen?

895
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:44,910
Just now. Tonight.

896
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:48,323
JOHN: l´ve sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

897
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:50,657
They´re gonna fucking crucify him.

898
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:53,792
They´re gonna line up! I gotta call Meisel.

899
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,541
I want Kevin on this case.

900
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:00,169
I hope you´re kidding.

901
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,675
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

902
00:51:09,602 --> 00:51:10,931
You´re dreaming!

903
00:51:13,523 --> 00:51:15,765
You know, l´ve shaken hands...

904
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:19,276
...with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

905

I´d take Kevin and I don´t look back.

906

John, you´ve got a great eye for talent.

907
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:30,413
You´re the master, but you know,
I just don´t see this happening.

908
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,916
I want you on board, Eddie.

909
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:39,129
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

910
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:42,177
We can get this case. The man´s our client.

911
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:44,754
He´s a business client.

912
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:47,506
We know him better
than he knows himself.

913
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,593
We´ve got the inside track.

914
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:53,934
We´ve got the best damn trial lawyer
in the city. It´s ours to lose.

915
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:58,443
Tell that to Cullen.

916
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:00,607
I want Kevin to tell him.

No, it´s Kevin.

923

No, it´s okay. I´m on it. Yeah, l´m on it.

Where are we at?

MARY ANN: You left me there.

926

I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

927

[Sobs] Three hours!
You don´t even call!

928

Stop.

929

Reset.

930

KEVIN: l´m upstairs with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

931
00:52:50,622 --> 00:52:54,751
There´s a good possibility l´m about
to catch a triple homicide defendant...

932
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:56,246
...who also happens to be...

933
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:59,623
...one of the largest real-estate developers
in this city.

934

KEVIN: Did you hear me?
MARY ANN: I was all by myself!

938
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,434
KEVIN: For three whole hours.

939
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,474
MARY ANN: The next time you make
a promise, try and keep it!

940
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:17,522
KEVIN: You gotta be kidding me, right?

941
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:20,811
MARY ANN: Go to hell. And you can go
to sleep on the fucking couch!

942

MAN 1 : You sure he´s up there?
MAN 2: Yeah, CNN passed the word.

ALEXANDER: Look at this.

944
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:32,780
I´m not out 20 minutes,
and l´m being followed by the press.

945

They´re like insects.

946
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:37,086
EDDIE: Alex, just calm down and listen,
okay?

947
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:43,419
I don´t know. Maybe you´re right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ!

948
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:46,174
This is my ass we´re talking about!

949
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:50,346
Alex, you know how this town works.

950
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:55,604
You´ve got enemies here
you haven´t heard from.

951
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:58,643
Now, with this...

952
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:01,066
JOHN: ...now that you´re down...

953
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:02,944

Now you´re going to have to ask yourself,
"who do you trust?"

ALEXANDER: I don´t know.

958
00:54:13,874 --> 00:54:15,831
I´m gonna have to look around.

on your person and clothes.

ALEXANDER: How do you know that?

968

There´s a second print in blood.

969
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:50,699
It´s a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

970

I have keys. I called the cops from
the house! I touched the goddamn wall!

...you need immediate representation.

They wouldn´t let me talk to her
from downtown.

988
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,329
They won´t let me talk to her
now that l´m out!

989
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:45,092
We need to issue a statement.

He´s a winner, Alex.

JACKIE: You know what you should do?

1008
00:56:56,123 --> 00:56:57,665
You should buy it...

1009

...wear it once, and then throw it away.

1010

...if Eddie wasn´t afraid of me

...he would´ve put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

It´s not my tits l´m worried about.

They look real.

1025
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:44,456
They must be real.

No, it´s okay, really.

Come on.

I think it´s fine.
But I also think it´s traumatic.

1047

1438
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,250
Wrong answer.

1439
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:43,755
Your prenuptial agreement´s
on file at the firm.

1440
01:22:43,842 --> 01:22:46,512
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1441
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,920
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1442
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,505
That´s a motive, Alex.

1443
01:22:52,517 --> 01:22:55,009
KEVIN: What do I need to know?

1444
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:04,770
Melissa, my assistant.

1445
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:07,939
She wasn´t even that good a fuck.

1446
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,279
And...

1447
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,861
...on the night in question?

1448
01:23:19,379 --> 01:23:23,043
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1449
01:23:28,554 --> 01:23:30,713
I´ve got to re-interview Melissa.

1450
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:34,057
No, forget it. We´re not telling that story.

1451
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:37,560
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1452
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:41,650
Alessandra, wait!

1453
01:23:42,694 --> 01:23:44,852
KEVIN: Alex!
ALEXANDER: Alessandra!

1454
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:46,738
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please!

1455
01:23:46,823 --> 01:23:49,314
MRS. SKYLAR: Time´s up, Mr. Cullen.

1456
01:23:49,409 --> 01:23:50,191
Alex!

1457
01:23:50,285 --> 01:23:51,566
I can´t!

1458
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:55,496
ALEXANDER: This isn´t fair.
I had 15 more minutes.

1459
01:23:55,582 --> 01:23:58,702
MRS. SKYLAR: You´ll just have to wait
until next week.

1460
01:23:59,586 --> 01:24:03,501
ALEXANDER: l´ll see you next week.
MAN: That´s it, l´m sorry.

1461
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:05,459
KEVIN: For sleep.

1462
01:24:05,634 --> 01:24:07,876
And she can take that during the day?

1463
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,796
No, she won´t be driving.

1464
01:24:10,138 --> 01:24:12,973
I´ll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1465
01:24:13,266 --> 01:24:17,478
He´s not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1466
01:24:17,646 --> 01:24:19,556
I´m taking you off the case.

1467
01:24:20,357 --> 01:24:21,057
What?

1468
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:22,894
I want you to drop this case.

1469
01:24:22,985 --> 01:24:24,645
This case? Cullen?

1470
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,858
-I´ve got a jury showing up.
-Do you love this woman?

1471
01:24:27,948 --> 01:24:30,237
-Of course I do.
-Then what are you doing?

1472
01:24:30,326 --> 01:24:31,606
She´s sick.

1473
01:24:31,785 --> 01:24:34,952
Everyone will understand. I´ll understand.

1474
01:24:35,122 --> 01:24:36,581
What about Cullen?

1475
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:38,660
We find somebody new.

1476
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:40,459
You consult.

1477
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,543
You live to fight another day.

1478
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:45,833
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1479
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:48,382
It´s a disappointment. We have them.

1480
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:53,013
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1481
01:24:55,518 --> 01:24:56,799
KEVIN: Hang on.

1482
01:24:56,978 --> 01:24:58,555
We´ve gotta talk about this.

1483
01:24:58,646 --> 01:25:01,980
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We´ve gotta talk about this."

1484
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:03,810
It´s your wife!

1485
01:25:03,985 --> 01:25:06,025
She´s sick, she needs you.

1486
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:08,153
She´s got to come first.

1487
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:10,068
All right, wait a minute.

1488
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,487
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

1489
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,702
You know what scares me?

1490
01:25:21,503 --> 01:25:23,994
I quit the case, she gets better...

1491
01:25:24,882 --> 01:25:26,625
...and I hate her for it.

1492
01:25:27,718 --> 01:25:29,093
KEVIN: I don´t want to resent her.

1493
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:30,636
I´ve got a winner here.

1494
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,849
I´ve got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1495
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:36,179
Then...

1496
01:25:36,685 --> 01:25:37,800
...then...

1497
01:25:38,187 --> 01:25:40,226
...put all my energy into her.

1498
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:48,689
I stand corrected.

1499
01:25:49,573 --> 01:25:52,491
JOHN: Fill me in. Did Cullen´s assistant
admit to the affair?

1500
01:25:52,576 --> 01:25:54,699
KEVIN: She did to me, but...

1501
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,448
...she won´t in court.

1502
01:25:56,873 --> 01:25:58,248
JOHN: Convince her otherwise.

1503
01:25:58,332 --> 01:26:01,287
BROYGO: And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

1504
01:26:01,377 --> 01:26:05,540
...when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

1505
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:07,173
...you will know...

1506
01:26:07,258 --> 01:26:09,927
...that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1507
01:26:10,094 --> 01:26:12,087
...of murdering three people...

1508
01:26:12,388 --> 01:26:13,931
...in cold blood...

1509
01:26:14,224 --> 01:26:16,596
...and with malice aforethought.

1510
01:26:17,227 --> 01:26:18,306
Thank you.

1511
01:26:19,687 --> 01:26:20,802
Your Honor.

1512
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:25,855
JUDGE: We can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1513
01:26:25,944 --> 01:26:27,901
If it´s a choice, l´ll go now.

1514
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:30,527
KEVIN: I won´t be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1515
01:26:30,615 --> 01:26:31,730
Proceed.

1516
01:26:36,955 --> 01:26:39,113
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1517
01:26:39,249 --> 01:26:43,081
...l know you´ve spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo.

1518
01:26:43,253 --> 01:26:44,534
I know you´re hungry.

1519
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:47,750
What I need to tell you
won´t take very long at all.

1520
01:26:49,093 --> 01:26:51,761
I don´t like Alexander Cullen.

1521
01:26:52,762 --> 01:26:54,921
I don´t think he´s a nice person.

1522
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,633
I don´t expect you to like him.

1523
01:26:58,435 --> 01:27:01,602
He´s been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1524
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:04,857
He´s been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1525
01:27:04,942 --> 01:27:07,101
He´s cheated the city, his partners...

1526
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:08,356
...his employees.

1527
01:27:08,445 --> 01:27:12,146
He´s paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

1528
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:13,984
I don´t like him.

1529
01:27:15,327 --> 01:27:19,160
I´m going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1530
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:22,125
...that are going to make you
like him even less.

1531
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:25,204
But this isn´t a popularity contest.

1532
01:27:25,295 --> 01:27:26,838
It´s a murder trial.

1533
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,253
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

1534
01:27:33,096 --> 01:27:36,928
...is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

1535
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:38,346
...when these...

1536
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:41,007
...horrible crimes took place.

1537
01:27:42,688 --> 01:27:44,099
Now, the State....

1538
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:47,015
The State is going all out here.

1539
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:49,020
They´ve got this whole team here...

1540
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:51,781
...throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

1541
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:53,608
I want one thing from you.

1542
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,196
That´s it.

1543
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:56,781
One thing.

1544
01:27:58,121 --> 01:28:00,446
I want you to ask yourself:

1545
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:04,034
"ls not liking this man...

1546
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:08,039
"...reason enough...

1547
01:28:08,465 --> 01:28:10,458
"...to convict him of murder?"

1548
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:14,797
Enjoy your lunch.

1549
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:16,549
We´ll talk again.

1550
01:28:19,226 --> 01:28:22,180
What the fuck was that about?
They´re going to hate me!

1551
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:25,391
Listen to me like you´ve never
to anyone before in your life.

1552
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:27,974
I´m gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1553
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:32,315
Because as long as you´re boning Melissa,
you´re not home killing your wife!

1554
01:28:34,408 --> 01:28:36,650
Why didn´t you say something before?

1555
01:28:37,411 --> 01:28:39,570
Then it doesn´t look spontaneous.

1556
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,328
You got it now.

1557
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:48,286
[Mumbles] Yeah.

1558
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:51,207
[Traffic noise, cars honking]

1559
01:28:53,845 --> 01:28:55,588
EDDIE: Hey! Kevin!

1560
01:28:57,348 --> 01:28:58,677
Saw you go in.

1561
01:28:58,767 --> 01:28:59,846
What´s up?

1562
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,760
Congratulations.

1563
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:05,685
-It´s not over yet.
-I´m not talking about the trial.

1564
01:29:05,857 --> 01:29:07,102
What are you talking about?

1565
01:29:07,191 --> 01:29:10,691
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm´s charter?

1566
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,943
What?

1567
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:14,988
It looks like it´s been there for years.

1568
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:17,861
So, now you´re a partner.
When did that happen?

1569
01:29:18,035 --> 01:29:22,033
EDDIE: You know, I still am
the managing director of this firm.

1570
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:23,950
You want my job, take me head on.

1571
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:25,417
You backdoor me one more time...

1572
01:29:25,502 --> 01:29:28,918
...and l´ll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1573
01:29:29,006 --> 01:29:32,422
I don´t know what you´re talking about.
I sure don´t like your tone of voice.

1574
01:29:32,509 --> 01:29:33,588
Bullshit.

1575
01:29:33,676 --> 01:29:35,384
You´ve got a problem with documents...

1576
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,385
...l suggest you put together
one of your late-night shredding sessions.

1577
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:40,719
Aah!

1578
01:29:43,645 --> 01:29:46,350
You think you´re tough enough
to run this firm?

1579
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:50,149
EDDIE: Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

1580
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,978
Tell your mentor...

1581
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:55,321
...the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe l´ll just...

1582
01:29:55,491 --> 01:29:57,033
...pick up the phone.

1583
01:30:01,789 --> 01:30:04,078
JOHN: Was he drunk?
KEVIN: I doubt it.

1584
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:05,709
He was going running.

1585
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:08,326
What the hell was he talking about?

1586
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,913
Eddie´s got himself in trouble again.

1587
01:30:12,758 --> 01:30:16,293
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can´t.

1588
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:20,387
Why does he think l´m after his job?

1589
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:23,685
JOHN: You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1590
01:30:23,769 --> 01:30:24,932
KEVIN: Not directly, no.

1591
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:25,969
You do now.

Why?

2073
01:58:50,427 --> 01:58:52,135
JOHN: Why do you think?

2074
01:58:52,596 --> 01:58:54,921
Because you´re so fucking good.

2075
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:56,470
Yes.

2076
01:58:57,184 --> 01:58:58,180
But why?

2077
01:59:00,312 --> 01:59:02,056
Because you´re my father?

2078
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,811
I´m a little more than that, Kevin.

2079
01:59:05,567 --> 01:59:08,521
JOHN: Awfully hot in that courtroom,
wasn´t it?

2080
01:59:08,696 --> 01:59:11,068
"What´s the game plan, Kevin?"

2081
01:59:12,241 --> 01:59:13,783
"lt was a nice run, Kev.

2082
01:59:13,868 --> 01:59:15,825
"Had to close out some day.

2083
01:59:15,953 --> 01:59:18,030
"Nobody wins them all."

2084
01:59:19,832 --> 01:59:21,030
What are you?

2085
01:59:24,462 --> 01:59:26,704
JOHN: I have so many names.

2086
01:59:28,549 --> 01:59:29,545
Satan.

2087
01:59:32,345 --> 01:59:33,626
Call me Dad.

2088
01:59:36,891 --> 01:59:38,515
Mary Ann, she knew it.

2089
01:59:39,727 --> 01:59:42,764
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

2090
01:59:42,897 --> 01:59:45,388
You´re blaming me for Mary Ann?

2091
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:47,525
I hope you´re kidding.

2092
01:59:47,652 --> 01:59:50,653
JOHN: Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

2093
01:59:50,739 --> 01:59:52,398
All she wanted was love.

2094
01:59:52,573 --> 01:59:54,566
Hey, you were too busy.

2095
01:59:54,742 --> 01:59:55,940
That´s a lie.

2096
01:59:57,412 --> 02:00:01,492
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

2097
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,995
That´s not true.
You don´t know what we had!

2098
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:06,499
I´m on your side!

2099
02:00:06,588 --> 02:00:08,580
[Screams] You´re a liar!

2100
02:00:09,924 --> 02:00:12,332
There´s nothing out there for you!

2101
02:00:12,427 --> 02:00:15,262
JOHN: Don´t be such a fucking chump!

2102
02:00:15,764 --> 02:00:18,255
JOHN: Stop deluding yourself!

2103
02:00:19,393 --> 02:00:21,682
I told you to take care of your wife!

2104
02:00:21,896 --> 02:00:23,224
JOHN: What did I say?

2105
02:00:23,314 --> 02:00:26,765
"The world would understand."
Didn´t I say that?

2106
02:00:26,942 --> 02:00:28,270
What did you do?

2107
02:00:29,278 --> 02:00:31,354
KEVIN´S VOICE:
"You know what scares me, John?

2108
02:00:31,447 --> 02:00:35,611
"l leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

2109
02:00:36,327 --> 02:00:37,786
Remember?

2110
02:00:38,705 --> 02:00:40,282
I know what you did.

2111
02:00:40,456 --> 02:00:41,701
You set me up.

2112
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:44,116
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Mr. Gettys?

2113
02:00:44,209 --> 02:00:47,460
JOHN: Who made that choice?
KEVIN: lt´s entrapment. You set me up.

2114
02:00:47,546 --> 02:00:50,382
And Moyez! The direction you took!

2115
02:00:50,466 --> 02:00:54,630
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

2116
02:00:54,804 --> 02:00:57,211
-Whose ideas were those?
-You played me!

2117
02:00:57,431 --> 02:00:58,973
It was a test! Your test!

2118
02:00:59,058 --> 02:01:02,142
And Cullen! Knowing he was guilty!

2119
02:01:02,979 --> 02:01:04,722
Seeing those pictures!

2120
02:01:04,814 --> 02:01:08,480
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand!

2121
02:01:08,652 --> 02:01:11,855
You brought me in. You put me there!
You made her lie!

2122
02:01:11,947 --> 02:01:13,855
I don´t do that, Kevin!

2123
02:01:13,948 --> 02:01:16,653
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

2124
02:01:16,951 --> 02:01:18,944
What were my words to you?

2125
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:23,948
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn´t think so.

2126
02:01:24,084 --> 02:01:26,160
Lose? I don´t lose!

2127
02:01:26,503 --> 02:01:27,701
I win!

2128
02:01:27,963 --> 02:01:29,373
I win!

2129
02:01:29,547 --> 02:01:32,916
[Screams] l´m a lawyer! That´s my job!
That´s what I do!

2130
02:01:34,845 --> 02:01:36,125
I rest my case.

2131
02:01:41,477 --> 02:01:43,019
Vanity...

2132
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:46,141
...is definitely my favorite sin.

2133
02:01:47,607 --> 02:01:50,099
JOHN: Kevin, it´s so basic.

2134
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:51,689
Self-love.

2135
02:01:51,862 --> 02:01:54,484
The all-natural opiate.

2136
02:01:55,533 --> 02:01:58,902
It´s not that you didn´t care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

2137
02:01:59,996 --> 02:02:03,863
...it´sjust that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

2138
02:02:05,626 --> 02:02:07,251
Yourself.

2139
02:02:10,006 --> 02:02:11,251
You´re right.

2140
02:02:11,632 --> 02:02:13,175
[Sobs] I did it all.

2141
02:02:13,718 --> 02:02:14,797
I let her go.

2142
02:02:14,886 --> 02:02:19,263
Don´t be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

2143
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:20,712
Believe me.

2144
02:02:21,892 --> 02:02:24,218
I left her behind and just kept going.

2145
02:02:24,395 --> 02:02:26,886
JOHN: You can´t keep punishing yourself.

2146
02:02:27,398 --> 02:02:30,234
It´s awesome how far you´ve come.

2147
02:02:30,819 --> 02:02:32,728
JOHN: I didn´t make it easy.

2148
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:34,227
Couldn´t.

2149
02:02:35,072 --> 02:02:36,567
Not for you...

2150
02:02:39,536 --> 02:02:41,244
JOHN: ...or your sister.

2151
02:02:45,542 --> 02:02:47,535
Half-sister, to be exact.

2152
02:02:48,253 --> 02:02:49,748
Surprise.

2153
02:02:50,588 --> 02:02:52,248
JOHN: Some scene, huh?

2154
02:02:56,052 --> 02:02:57,761
Don´t let him scare you.

2155
02:02:58,764 --> 02:03:00,922
JOHN: l´ve had so many children.

2156
02:03:01,433 --> 02:03:04,185
I´ve had so many disappointments.

2157
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:06,809
Mistake after mistake.

2158
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:08,605
JOHN: And then there´s you.

2159
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:09,935
The two of you.

2160
02:03:13,112 --> 02:03:14,772
What do you want from me?

2161
02:03:14,863 --> 02:03:16,655
I want you to be yourself.

2162
02:03:16,949 --> 02:03:18,657
You know, l´ll tell you, boy...

2163
02:03:18,743 --> 02:03:19,941
...guilt...

2164
02:03:20,119 --> 02:03:22,445
...it´s like a bag of fucking bricks.

2165
02:03:22,538 --> 02:03:24,329
JOHN: All you got to do...

2166
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,117
...is set it down.

2167
02:03:29,378 --> 02:03:31,537
I know what you´re going through.

2168
02:03:31,631 --> 02:03:33,125
CHRISTABELLA: l´ve been there.

2169
02:03:33,216 --> 02:03:35,043
Just come here. Come here.

2170
02:03:35,218 --> 02:03:36,926
CHRISTABELLA: Let it go.

2171
02:03:38,221 --> 02:03:39,928
I can´t do that.

2172
02:03:43,643 --> 02:03:46,597
Who are you carrying all those bricks for?

2173
02:03:47,313 --> 02:03:48,689
JOHN: God?

2174
02:03:48,857 --> 02:03:50,232
Is that it?

2175
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,563
God?

2176
02:03:51,651 --> 02:03:53,062
JOHN: l´ll tell you...

2177
02:03:53,153 --> 02:03:56,604
...let me give you
a little inside information about God.

2178
02:03:57,156 --> 02:03:58,983
God likes to watch.

2179
02:03:59,158 --> 02:04:00,569
He´s a prankster.

2180
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,988
Think about it.

2181
02:04:02,328 --> 02:04:03,989
He gives man...

2182
02:04:04,164 --> 02:04:05,575
...instincts.

2183
02:04:06,416 --> 02:04:09,999
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does He do?

2184
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:13,040
I swear, for his own amusement...

2185
02:04:13,173 --> 02:04:16,127
...his own private, cosmic...

2186
02:04:16,259 --> 02:04:17,588
...gag reel...

2187
02:04:18,386 --> 02:04:20,842
...He sets the rules in opposition.

2188
02:04:21,014 --> 02:04:22,509
It´s the goof of all time.

2189
02:04:22,599 --> 02:04:24,925
Look, but don´t touch.

2190
02:04:26,604 --> 02:04:28,928
Touch, but don´t taste.

2191
02:04:30,774 --> 02:04:33,016
Taste, but don´t swallow.

2192
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:34,189
[John giggles]

2193
02:04:34,278 --> 02:04:38,192
And while you´re jumping from one foot
to the next, what is He doing?

2194
02:04:38,365 --> 02:04:41,865
He´s laughing his sick, fucking ass off!

2195
02:04:42,161 --> 02:04:43,656
He´s a tightass!

2196
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:46,118
He´s a sadist!

2197
02:04:46,623 --> 02:04:49,293
He´s an absentee landlord!

2198
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:51,749
Worship that? Never!

2199
02:04:52,546 --> 02:04:55,713
"Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven," is that it?

2200
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,963
Why not?

2201
02:04:57,218 --> 02:05:01,879
I´m here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began!

2202
02:05:02,807 --> 02:05:07,303
I´ve nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have!

2203
02:05:07,562 --> 02:05:11,227
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him!

2204
02:05:11,357 --> 02:05:15,936
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections!

2205
02:05:16,154 --> 02:05:18,229
[Furiously] l´m a fan of man!

2206
02:05:20,158 --> 02:05:21,569
I´m a humanist.

2207
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:23,783
Maybe the last humanist.

2208
02:05:24,788 --> 02:05:26,827
JOHN: Who, in their right mind...

2209
02:05:26,915 --> 02:05:29,240
...Kevin, could possibly deny...

2210
02:05:29,418 --> 02:05:32,253
...the 20th century was entirely mine?

2211
02:05:32,421 --> 02:05:34,876
[Yells] All of it, Kevin!

2212
02:05:35,423 --> 02:05:36,799
All of it.

2213
02:05:37,425 --> 02:05:38,670
Mine.

2214
02:05:39,761 --> 02:05:41,421
I´m peaking, Kevin.

2215
02:05:42,306 --> 02:05:43,681
It´s my time now.

2216
02:05:45,684 --> 02:05:46,965
It´s our time.

2217
02:05:47,770 --> 02:05:49,311
Anybody want a drink?

2218
02:05:51,189 --> 02:05:52,767
I´m having a drink.

2219
02:05:56,111 --> 02:05:58,318
This is some pitch, all this.

2220
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:01,233
You must need me pretty bad.

2221
02:06:01,325 --> 02:06:03,033
KEVIN: What do you want?

2222
02:06:04,162 --> 02:06:05,785
JOHN: Eddie was right.

2223
02:06:06,788 --> 02:06:08,947
I want you to take over the firm.

2224
02:06:09,667 --> 02:06:10,746
You...

2225
02:06:11,919 --> 02:06:13,378
...and your sister.

2226
02:06:17,633 --> 02:06:19,507
KEVIN: ls that it?
JOHN: No.

2227
02:06:21,845 --> 02:06:23,637
She´s ovulating...

2228
02:06:24,014 --> 02:06:25,259
...right now.

2229
02:06:26,267 --> 02:06:28,058
KEVIN: What?
JOHN: Your vanity...

2230
02:06:28,144 --> 02:06:30,635
...is justified, Kevin.

2231
02:06:31,981 --> 02:06:33,179
Your seed...

2232
02:06:33,358 --> 02:06:35,315
