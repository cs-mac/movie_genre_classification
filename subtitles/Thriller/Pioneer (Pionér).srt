00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:13,261
<i>There are events that become
pivot points in history.</i>

2
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:16,724
<i>We usually mark the past
by the wars we fight,</i>

3
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:21,454
<i>where you hear people talk about things
before the war and the world after the war.</i>

4
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:25,865
<i>The after-the-war world is born out
of human struggle and cruelty.</i>

5
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:31,922
<i>Sometimes there are events born out of human
ingenuity and courage like discovering fire,</i>

6
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:35,526
<i>or inventing the Internet,
or walking on the moon.</i>

7
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,959
<i>Sometimes it's a little of both.</i>

8
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:43,373
<i>We had no idea what was going to happen
or what we were going to do about it.</i>

9
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:45,903
<i>And we had no idea the price we'd pay.</i>

10
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,730
<i>There was no plan...</i>

11
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:53,691
<i>There were no lofty thoughts
about changing the world.</i>

12
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,057
<i>We just did what we thought
was right at the time.</i>

13
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,947
<i>And I would do it all again,
even knowing the consequences.</i>

14
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,576
See, the thing is, I've never
actually written a resume before.

15
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:15,658
Wait, are you kidding?

16
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,601
No, I've just never had to.

17
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,566
You know, school led to one thing, which led
another thing, to another thing, which led...

18
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,836
No, okay. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

19
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,502
But I mean, come on. You're 29
years old, and you've never...

20
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,173
28 years old, please.

21
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:31,029
All right, 28. And you have
never written a resume?

22
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,325
Yeah, no...

23
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:36,256
this is the first time that I've actually
had to put like a real one together.

24
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:39,282
All right. Okay, so the only
thing that I would say is,

25
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,144
I know it seems to make sense to put
everything in chronological order...

26
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:47,393
but you might want to start with your
most recent work and then work backwards.

27
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,650
- I get it. And go, and go... right.
- Right. Because then the most relevant

28
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,734
- stuff is at the top
- Right, that makes sense. That makes sense.

29
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,953
That's good advice.
Good tip. Good Stuff.

30
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,348
This is why I come to you.

31
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,528
That's weird.

32
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:01,306
Top ten things you don't want to hear
someone saying in a space observatory

33
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,732
that's weird is definitely
on there somewhere.

34
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,862
All right, so what's number one?

35
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,096
Like...

36
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,040
what the hell was that? That's on there.

37
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,922
Yeah, but what about like...

38
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:11,952
oh my god.

39
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,580
Right? Like,

40
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,293
- oh - my - god.
- Yeah, no, you're right. That's worse.

41
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:18,217
That's definitely number one, yeah.

42
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:22,912
Can one of you or both of you come over here
and tell me what this looks like to you?

43
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,842
Which one are you up to now?

44
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:29,320
These are captures from NEO94853

45
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,650
from last night.

46
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,118
Alright, what am I looking at?

47
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,350
Right here.

48
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,733
All right, that looks manmade.

49
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:38,763
Yeah.

50
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:42,586
Those are all most definitely
solar panels on the ends there.

51
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,753
But it's not a satellite out that far?

52
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:45,783
A probe?

53
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,631
That's the only think I
can think of, but we're...

54
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,931
we're already tracking all the
probes that are out there.

55
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,453
Well, is it possible they're
some we're not tracking?

56
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,883
I mean, I suppose.

57
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:59,265
I don't know what else it could be.
So if it's not ours, then what?

58
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,241
- Russian?
- Or, Chinese?

59
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:04,563
I don't think so.
This thing's coming toward us,

60
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:07,369
which means it would have had
to have been launched years ago

61
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,362
in order for it to be on
this kind of trajectory

62
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:12,257
and the Chinese have never sent
anything out that far, so.

63
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:15,527
What is its trajectory exactly?
How close is going to get to us?

64
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,344
It'll get close, but...

65
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:20,042
it won't catch us. In fact...

66
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:24,522
it's probably crossing our orbit right
about now if it hasn't done so already.

67
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,688
Are you sure it's not going to catch us?

68
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,118
Pretty sure. Yeah.

69
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:29,415
And anyway...

70
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:32,887
it would just burn up before
it got near the ground.

71
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,127
Okay, sir, if you stop now, if you go...

72
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,297
Okay go one back.

73
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,349
One forward, one forward, forward.

74
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:41,019
- Stop there. Right there. Right.
- Yeah...

75
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:42,860
What are you thinking?

76
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:44,327
Call me...

77
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,078
crazy.

78
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,899
There are many who do.

79
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:50,254
Yeah.

80
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,519
It's not the same angle, but...

81
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,793
This comes off, right?

82
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:19,932
Does it?

83
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,591
Yeah. This is Taylor.

84
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:51,037
- Do you ever sleep?
- No fatalities.

85
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,167
Some debris came down in and around
Station but it didn't hit any with people.

86
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,671
- An airliner?
- That's what we think now

87
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,135
but we're trying to confirm
with eye witnesses.

88
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:58,820
Have you checked with airports
for any overdue flights?

89
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,876
Yeah, we're checking. Nothing yet.

90
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,316
Why would someone blow up
an airliner over Montana?

91
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:03,981
Why does anyone ever
blow up an airliner?

92
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,861
Yeah. Is Vernon and the
new guy in there yet?

93
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,076
They're waiting for you in your office

94
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,765
- What's his name again? I know you told me
- DiLeo.

95
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,494
- DiLeo.
- There's something else though

96
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,672
that might turn this into
a whole other thing.

97
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,753
I just got a call saying
that hospitals in the area

98
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,320
are reporting multiple
patients coming in

99
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,449
with symptoms consistent
with radiation sickness.

100
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,134
- A dirty bomb?
- We haven't confirmed that yet.

101
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:22,661
- But that's what it looks like?
- Nobody really knows what that looks like.

102
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,431
We might find out tonight Get the
Mayor of Station on the phone

103
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,625
and tell him there's a quarantine
in effect for Station Township

104
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,642
and everything within a 10 mile radius.

105
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,210
- Coordinate with local authorities.
- We shouldn't wait for confirmation?

106
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,409
Do you really feel like taking
chances with radiation?

107
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,070
But get some feet on the
ground to confirm that.

108
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:46,644
But I need you to confirm that.

109
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:49,688
Sir, there are positive cases of radiation
sickness in 2 separate hospitals.

110
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:51,312
- How do you spell that?
- I just ordered a quarantine

111
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,617
for Station Township and everything
within a 10 mile radius.

112
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,322
One of the cases is from a hospital
30 miles north of Station.

113
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:59,340
I'm going to need a copy of that faxed
to this office before I can do...

114
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Thank you.

115
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:05,542
Sir, a major piece of debris,
a piece of a plane's fuselage maybe

116
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,878
crash landed in a wooded area
outside of Edmonton in Canada.

117
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:11,359
We're getting a formal request for
assistance from your counterpart

118
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,997
in the RCMP faxed here right now.

119
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:15,119
Good, we're not passing this
one off on the Mounties.

120
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,898
I got the Governor and the Mayor of Station
waiting to speak with you on lines 2 and 4.

121
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,066
Vernon, you're going to stay in touch
with those hospitals and the Station P.D.

122
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,423
Give them anything they need Send
me updates every half an hour.

123
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,186
You, I need you to send
me a copy of that fax

124
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,481
as soon as you get it in
your hands to my phone.

125
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,112
- Can you handle that?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,001
Call down to the airfield for a car.

127
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,792
Agent Larson and I are leaving for
Edmonton in 15 minutes. Make it happen.

128
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:47,464
I told you his name was DiLeo.

129
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:51,081
Yeah, I know. I only had so much room
at this particular moment, so...

130
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:52,372
You good?

131
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:54,365
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,913
Why are we going to Edmonton?

133
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,108
'Cause we're not going to be
the next news media punch line

134
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:01,838
that screwed the pooch
on a terrorism case.

135
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,308
We stay out in front of this thing

136
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,639
and show the country that we're
actually good for something.

137
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,161
- How does that sound to you?
- No argument here.

138
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,625
Good. Let's do this right.

139
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,587
- Yes, sir. Lines 2 and 4.
- Thank you Sophie.

140
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Mr. Mayor, this is Tom Taylor.

141
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,415
Do you know where I can get a
cup of coffee or something?

142
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:50,645
Mr. Secretary.

143
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,715
Yes, sir. I do too, sir.

144
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,331
Thank you.

145
00:10:57,963 --> 00:11:01,044
They have us set up at a
defunct airbase in Calgary.

146
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:05,263
They're shipping the suspect to
a facility here for treatment.

147
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,746
I don't know that yet, sir.
We'll know more very soon.

148
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,265
I -- with...

149
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,771
all due respect sir, I...

150
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,608
think that's a little premature.

151
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:23,638
I'm...

152
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:26,996
not ready to label this an
act of terror just yet.

153
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,679
I understand there are political...

154
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:35,564
we just don't know that yet sir.

155
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:39,309
And what we do know just isn't
adding up to my satisfaction.

156
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,577
Just need a little more time to sort...

157
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,410
Yes, sir. That's why we're here.

158
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,780
Well I appreciate that, sir, yes.

159
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:54,715
Yes, sir.

160
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,717
You'll know as soon as I do.

161
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:58,999
Thank you.

162
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:03,606
Tom?

163
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:04,804
Jesus Christ!

164
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,184
- Sorry. We have...
- No, it's okay.

165
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,778
We've got the Deputy Secretary pressuring me
to announce that we've captured a terrorist.

166
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:14,558
He says it would be politically
expedient to do it now before...

167
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,265
a whole debate over the
definition of what constitutes

168
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,868
an act of terror starts in the media

169
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,426
and I'm trying to tell him...

170
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,156
in so many words that...

171
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,657
I don't want to start
counting my chickens... What?

172
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:26,899
He's here.

173
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:44,364
He started yelling at us. I think in
Russian before we got the hatch open.

174
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,472
Once we identified ourselves,
he shut up...

175
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:49,505
and that's when we noticed he
had a pistol in his right hand.

176
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,599
He couldn't raise it enough
to point it at us though.

177
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,886
I don't know if he would have shot
at us, or if he was just scared.

178
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:58,360
Does that kid look like
a terrorist to you?

179
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:00,887
I don't know what he looks like.

180
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,205
He's stable now.

181
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,208
He was extremely dehydrated,

182
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,488
malnourished...

183
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:25,192
and I'm running every
test that I can think of.

184
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,272
He'll live?

185
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,017
He's got a good shot.

186
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,235
The fact that he survived

187
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:33,941
all this time under the
conditions that he's been living

188
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,321
gives me hope that he's got a chance.

189
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,291
But he's gonna need, I don't know,
could be years of rehabilitation.

190
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,664
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

191
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:44,344
Frankly, no, I haven't.

192
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,030
The only cases...

193
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,994
that come close that I know of...

194
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:51,970
is severe child abuse where a
child is held hostage in a room

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,900
or a basement and neglected.

196
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:57,241
It's like he's been living
in a cave his whole life.

197
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:58,631
Can he talk?

198
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:00,383
He's sleeping now.

199
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,699
He's in shock

200
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:05,036
I can't guarantee he'll make
any sense when he wakes up.

201
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,358
Let me know as soon as he does.

202
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,388
Will do.

203
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,251
You said he was yelling something
when you found him. Do you...

204
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:14,052
remember what he was saying?

205
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,448
Not really. It was something
in Russian, I think

206
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,478
She speaks about 47 languages.

207
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:20,852
Whatever you remember

208
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,976
Something like...

209
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,536
"identiforo"... something.

210
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,606
"Nikorosh vi stronia."

211
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:30,931
"Nikorosh vistronia"

212
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:34,098
"Identifutsoro vitsebia."
Could that have been the first part?

213
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,286
Yes. I think so, I think that was it.

214
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,513
"Identify yourself."

215
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,043
What about the rest?

216
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,966
"Which side are you?"

217
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,227
You said he kept repeating that?

218
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,257
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,514
"Which side are you?"

220
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,001
Which side of what?

221
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:51,531
That's what I heard.

222
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:55,939
What does that mean? Are you sure
you're translating that right?

223
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,119
47 languages.

224
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,459
He was wearing this when we found him.

225
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,275
Is that a spacesuit?

226
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,321
- May I?
- It's clear.

227
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,827
Hello?

228
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,366
Look.

229
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,459
Maybe they just haven't
sprung for new patches.

230
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:22,608
Does that kid look like he was even
born when there was a Soviet Union?

231
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,124
Sirs?

232
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,151
That's no airliner.

233
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,071
No, it's not.

234
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,953
We found these in the capsule.

235
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,710
- Those look like rocks.
- They are, rocks.

236
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,539
And we found this.

237
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,119
I guess it's also Russian.

238
00:15:58,796 --> 00:15:59,846
What is it?

239
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,319
I'm not sure.

240
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:04,179
It looks like a page from
some kind of flight manual.

241
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,323
There's something
handwritten on the back

242
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:12,941
What?

243
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,709
<i>That's the most ridiculous
story I've ever heard.</i>

244
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:20,057
Yes sir. We're investigating
all the possibilities.

245
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:23,145
<i>It sounds more like someone got their
hands on some old Soviet hardware</i>

246
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,927
<i>and are using it to perpetrate
an attack on the United States.</i>

247
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,610
An attack on Montana, sir?

248
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,064
<i>Maybe it went wrong. I don't know.</i>

249
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:31,388
<i>All I know is, I have
sick people in hospitals</i>

250
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,693
<i>and a potential public
relations nightmare.</i>

251
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:35,884
<i>We have to show we have a
handle on the situation.</i>

252
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:39,898
<i>I don't need to remind you that our record on
these things hasn't been exemplary of late.</i>

253
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,179
With all due respect, sir. I'm not
convinced we're dealing with terrorism

254
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,509
All we have is a sick kid,
possibly a Russian national.

255
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,694
I don't think treating him
like a criminal is the best...

256
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,107
<i>He had no identification...</i>

257
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:53,737
<i>and piloted a craft spreading
radiation over American cities.</i>

258
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:57,201
<i>First thing he does is pull a gun on
the people who are rescuing him.</i>

259
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,081
<i>Have I got that much right?</i>

260
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,295
Yes, sir. All those things are true

261
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:05,125
<i>Then he's a criminal until we have
firm evidence to the contrary.</i>

262
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:06,896
<i>Whatever the case</i>

263
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,567
<i>I want you to take the suspect to an
American base immediately, and we'll...</i>

264
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,454
I don't think that's the best
course of action at this time, sir.

265
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,795
I'd like more time to investigate
before we jump to any conclusions.

266
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:20,143
I'm not making suggestions, Mr. Taylor.

267
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,823
I want you to move him
as soon as you can.

268
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,378
Yes sir.

269
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:27,543
Okay then. We'll be in
touch throughout the day.

270
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:35,726
Yeah?

271
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:39,668
We've recovered another piece
of the capsule outside Calgary.

272
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:44,170
There was a nuclear battery onboard; it looks
like that was the source of the radiation.

273
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,591
It's in an unpopulated area,
so there's that bit of good news.

274
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,183
Yeah.

275
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
What?

276
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:53,758
We're leaving.

277
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,335
They didn't believe it either?

278
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:58,458
I don't blame them. It's crazy.

279
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:01,089
It's also the only thing that
makes any kind of sense.

280
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,772
Sophie. It makes no kind of sense.

281
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:07,390
What do you think? Some Al Qaeda nut job
makes a play for an old Soviet space capsule

282
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,220
instead of a nuclear bomb,

283
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,229
somehow manages to launch
it from a cave in Tora Bora

284
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,338
on a mission to scare the
bejesus out of Montana.

285
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,482
- Where's the sense in that?
- It spread radiation over hundreds of miles.

286
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:23,579
It just seems like a round about way to
spread terror, if terror's your goal.

287
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,780
I know. I know, I...

288
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,066
I don't know what else to do.
I don't know what else there is to do.

289
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,019
Well, nothing besides get some sleep.

290
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,156
I don't have time for that,
and neither do you.

291
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,538
We have a sick kid in a hospital bed.

292
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:38,118
He's not a terrorist.

293
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:39,838
He's not a Martian either.

294
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,168
Well, maybe not.

295
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,507
What's that?

296
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,318
It's a letter from the RCMP allowing
us to operate in Canadian territory

297
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,798
DiLeo sent it over.

298
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,591
I asked for this like 12 hours ago.

299
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,661
He said he had trouble converting it
to a PDF, or something. I don't know.

300
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,597
He's supposed to be America's
first line of defense.

301
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,622
- The best and the brightest.
- Which one are you?

302
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,698
I've always been the best,
but never the brightest.

303
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,575
Well, I've always been the brightest,
but never quite the best.

304
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,508
You know, if this whole serving and
protecting thing doesn't work out,

305
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,593
I think we have a sitcom in our future.

306
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,473
I'll make the arrangements.

307
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,503
Thank you.

308
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,216
This is Taylor.

309
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,197
Mr. Taylor, this is Dr.
Bertram. I was the physician...

310
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,314
Yeah. I know who you are.
How's he doing?

311
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:33,078
I've just gotten the preliminary
blood work back and he has cancer.

312
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,358
Say that again.

313
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,504
<i>I'm no oncologist, but...</i>

314
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,401
but his body's riddled with it.

315
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,904
<i>I've called in an expert.</i>

316
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,284
<i>Slow down doctor.</i>

317
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:43,857
Get him ready to be moved.
He's coming back with us to the States.

318
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,035
I don't think that's a good idea.

319
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:50,000
I didn't ask your opinion, and besides that,
the decision's already been made.

320
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,340
We've been granted authority to
operate in this jurisdiction

321
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,212
<i>and whether you like it or not, you answer
to me, do you understand that?</i>

322
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,247
Yes.

323
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,153
Anything else I should know?

324
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:04,271
He's developed a respiratory infection,
he's not responding to treatment.

325
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:06,801
If you put him on a plane,
you could kill him.

326
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,602
And this is your professional opinion?

327
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:10,682
What other opinion would it be?

328
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:12,591
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:16,413
He's coming back with us.
He'll receive treatment in the States.

330
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:18,527
- Get ready to move him.
- Yes sir.

331
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:55,244
<i>Tom Taylor.</i>

332
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:58,189
<i>- How'd you know it was me?
- I've got caller id,</i>

333
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,069
like the rest of the world.

334
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,701
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

335
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:05,231
<i>No, just about to play my round of golf;</i>

336
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,425
like I did yesterday...

337
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:10,119
like I probably will tomorrow.

338
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,524
Sounds like the life you always wanted.

339
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,636
It's not.

340
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:17,414
<i>Yeah. Sorry I didn't make it to that
dinner I read about in the paper.</i>

341
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,509
<i>Congratulations.</i>

342
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,539
Thank you.

343
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,529
<i>That's not why you called.</i>

344
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:25,705
Yeah. No

345
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,157
<i>Messy business up there.</i>

346
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:31,077
Please...

347
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,525
<i>tell me you haven't
called for a pep talk.</i>

348
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:36,082
<i>Yeah. Not exactly.</i>

349
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:38,844
Then what?

350
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,107
I got golf to play.

351
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,313
Yeah. Well...

352
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,743
this may seem a little strange, but...

353
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,230
I need your insight on something.

354
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,117
<i>My insight?</i>

355
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:53,372
Yeah.

356
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,330
Just how crazy were
the Soviets? I mean...

357
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,036
just how crazy were they?

358
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,066
You know.

359
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,568
You were there.

360
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:06,756
I was a kid, I wasn't on
the front lines like you.

361
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:08,768
Well.

362
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:17,398
I never put anything pass them,
I'll say that. Never.

363
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:19,926
Naw...

364
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,529
some people thought
we were a bunch of...

365
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,885
<i>paranoid theomongers in the agency,</i>

366
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:29,315
<i>but all the stuff we learned when
we left after the fall. Jesus!</i>

367
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,574
<i>It was a crazy time than.</i>

368
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,627
Hell, we were crazy too but...

369
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:36,925
they were crazier...

370
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,126
I really mean that.

371
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:44,155
<i>Did you ever hear of a guy
named Stanislov Petrov?</i>

372
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:46,941
No.

373
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,638
<i>Me neither, not until
about 10 years ago.</i>

374
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:53,446
Stanislov Petrov was in the
Soviet Air Defense Force and...

375
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:58,746
he was on duty in a bunker just
outside Moscow one night in 1983.

376
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:02,300
His job was to monitor OKO,

377
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,931
the Soviet early warning system.

378
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:06,986
Kind of like our NORAD.

379
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,859
<i>They had a network of satellites up
in orbit, just like we did...</i>

380
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,789
<i>to alert them if the U.S.
launched their missiles.</i>

381
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,002
<i>Anyway...</i>

382
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,631
old Stanislav was on duty,

383
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:24,063
eating his day old bread,
drinking his Vodka, whatever they did.

384
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,069
He saw something he'd never seen before.

385
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,830
A big board lit up all red,
and alarms going off...

386
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:35,402
blaring.

387
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,742
What it was telling
him was that the U.S.

388
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:43,311
had launched their ICBM's, their...

389
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:47,014
their nuclear ICBM's at his country.

390
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,773
His job in that event...

391
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,251
was to fire his country's missiles back.

392
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:57,674
But he didn't.

393
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,310
He didn't believe it.

394
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:05,795
<i>For some reason, in his gut it
just didn't feel right.</i>

395
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:10,448
<i>So, he ignored all his orders
and all his training...</i>

396
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,580
and he turned the alarm off.

397
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:16,312
To make a long story short...

398
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:21,311
the sun was bouncing off some
clouds or something or other...

399
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:24,717
and confused the satellite
into thinking...

400
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,597
missiles were on their way.

401
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,564
If Stanislav Petrov...

402
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:33,894
had done what he was supposed to do...

403
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:37,292
we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now.

404
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,772
<i>And you know what happened to him?</i>

405
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:44,906
<i>Discharged...</i>

406
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:46,086
<i>dishonorably.</i>

407
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,200
Probably sent to Siberia...

408
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,842
or somewhere. Who knows.

409
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,857
The man defied his country...

410
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,495
and saved the world.

411
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,271
Quite literally saved the world.

412
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:07,709
<i>And he faced the consequences.</i>

413
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,739
<i>Because...</i>

414
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,600
<i>I think he had something the
rest of his country didn't.</i>

415
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,470
Imagination.

416
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:17,733
He...

417
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,138
could imagine the consequences
of following his orders.

418
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,038
And those consequences were

419
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,668
unconscionable to him.

420
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,916
And that's how crazy they were.

421
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:40,552
<i>Does that about answer your question?</i>

422
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:42,657
I guess so.

423
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:44,912
Anyway...

424
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:48,023
It was sweet of you to...

425
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,180
to call an old man for his advice, Tom.

426
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,359
It really is.

427
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,201
<i>Get out there and do a job, will ya?</i>

428
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:58,231
Yes, sir.

429
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:01,433
Next time you're in the neighborhood...

430
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:03,863
Yeah. I'm not really much of a golfer.

431
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,267
Me neither.

432
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,608
Take care, Frank.

433
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:11,588
<i>You should be more concerned with
taking care of yourself right now.</i>

434
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:14,308
Bye.

435
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,769
Get our people up here.

436
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,506
As little as possible.

437
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,421
We need to give them something.
They're sniffing blood in the water.

438
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,357
Otherwise they're just going to
run with whatever they can find.

439
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,958
- He's right. We can say...
- Why don't we just say

440
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,466
that a Soviet satellite and
old Soviet satellite...

441
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:43,587
- With a leak in the battery onboard. Yes.
- Came down just like it did.

442
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:44,708
- Can you work with that?
- Yes.

443
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,710
Great. Put something together
and give it to the press.

444
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,463
All right, that takes care of
the press. Now what about -

445
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:50,162
- Don't worry about that.
- Don't worry about that?

446
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,503
- DiLeo, do you still have that fax?
- Yes, sir.

447
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,093
- Alright, you never got it.
- Sir?

448
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,606
- The right answer is, what fax?
- Yes sir.

449
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,478
What are you doing?

450
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,799
I believe the technical term is gumming up
the works and buying some time to investigate

451
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,764
before we end up shipping
that kid to a federal prison.

452
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:10,332
Jesus Christ! Can we get a cup of coffee
around her that tastes like coffee, please?

453
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:14,326
Send someone to Willie Horton's,
or whatever they have up here.

454
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:16,816
- Get some for everyone, will you?
- We need an expert in here.

455
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:19,355
Someone who knows what they're
talking about, and quietly.

456
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,171
An expert? On what?

457
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:28,334
It's open.

458
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:32,694
Yes?

459
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,002
Zachary Walzer?

460
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:37,621
Dr. Zachary Walzer.

461
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,763
Can I help you?

462
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,634
Dr. Walzer.

463
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,077
I'm Tom Taylor.

464
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:54,765
Sorry about all the...

465
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,720
I know this is a little strange.

466
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,018
I think I know why I'm here.

467
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:01,643
You do.

468
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:04,677
That dirty bomb thing
wasn't a dirty bomb. Right?

469
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:06,452
- No, it was actually...
- Funny thing about that downed

470
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:08,682
- satellite story.
- What's that?

471
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:11,939
I heard it on the news this morning
and I couldn't help feeling

472
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,178
like I'd heard it
somewhere before, so...

473
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,661
so I did a bit of Googling,

474
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:17,541
and in about 2 minutes...

475
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:18,827
I found this.

476
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,869
Apparently a Soviet Satellite
carrying a nuclear battery

477
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,347
made an unplanned reentry
into the Earth's atmosphere

478
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:29,077
spreading radioactive
material over Canada.

479
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:30,924
That's right.

480
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,319
You see, that article is from 1979.

481
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:37,432
Funny coincidence, right?

482
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:40,331
2 Soviet satellites accidentally
come down and spread radiation

483
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,276
over the same part of
the world? I mean...

484
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,706
that's some bad luck. Don't you think?

485
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:49,816
You might want to do a little research
before you put out a bogus cover story.

486
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,005
Well, as I can see,
you've already gathered

487
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:56,685
we're in a bit of a
situation here that...

488
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:59,997
quite frankly, it's a little
outside my area of expertise.

489
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,927
- I don't doubt it.
- Good.

490
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,886
Then you'll understand why we're in
need of a little outside consulting.

491
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,616
I understand you're some
kind of space buff.

492
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:10,974
I have a Masters in
Aeronautics and Astronautics

493
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:12,865
and a PhD in Nuclear Engineering.

494
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,768
- There you go.
- I've written 3 books

495
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,791
on celestial mechanics
and manned space flight.

496
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:21,121
Two Planets, One Future, and The Case
for the Red Planet. What's the third?

497
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:26,224
It's coming out next fall. No title yet.

498
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,448
What exactly have you got going on here.

499
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:34,128
I'll need you to sign the Confidentially
Agreement before I can tell you anything.

500
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:36,398
Forgive me.

501
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:40,081
You'll understand if I'm a little hesitant
to do anything you say or sign anything.

502
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,154
You're the guys who
have made flying from

503
00:29:42,184 --> 00:29:44,195
Seattle to Cleveland to be a real ordeal

504
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:46,890
and flying to the Moon doesn't
exactly instill confidence.

505
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,444
I'm trying to protect
the American people.

506
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:50,865
And what a bang up job
you've done on that so far.

507
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,639
The fact is, we're in a bit of a
spot here and we could use someone

508
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,319
with your knowledge
and expertise on this.

509
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,799
If it's not you, it'll be someone else.

510
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,245
What could you possible
want with someone like me?

511
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:04,775
Imagination, Doctor.

512
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:06,998
Imagination.

513
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,558
Don't tell me it's
extraterrestrial. Really.

514
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,347
Or I'll just walk right
back out that door.

515
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:19,113
No. It's actually a
little weirder than that.

516
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,729
Come with me.

517
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:43,803
Theoretically, is it possible
for someone to survive on Mars?

518
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,841
Absolutely.

519
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:46,750
For years on their own
with limited resources?

520
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,670
Well sure. I've written a lot about this.
It's called the living off the land approach.

521
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,583
Like the pioneers who settled
the Western United States.

522
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:57,493
All the elements of survival are right there
on Mars if you know how to extract them.

523
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,380
It's surviving the trip
there that's the hard part.

524
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,053
You've got a million kinds
of background radiation,

525
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,040
cosmic rays, solar flare activity.

526
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,273
Plus nine months without a gas
station to stop at if you get a flat.

527
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,869
What's happened to his man?

528
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:21,999
You tell me.

529
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,049
This is your Martian pioneer.

530
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:27,742
What?

531
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:30,090
The Soviet satellite wasn't a satellite;

532
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,020
it was some sort of capsule.

533
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,451
We found him inside.

534
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,304
We also found a note.

535
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:39,912
If it's to be believed,
it was written by a Soviet Cosmonaut

536
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,431
who claims to have been living
on Mars since the mid '80's.

537
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:46,670
According to the note,
this supposedly is their child.

538
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,517
Wait. What?

539
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:50,267
Slow down.

540
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:55,105
You're really saying, seriously, that...

541
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:57,185
that this man has been to Mars?

542
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,659
We're saying he was born there.

543
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,904
Well how is that possible?

544
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:04,284
That's what we'd like you to tell us.

545
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,064
Dr. Walzer.

546
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,455
Are you all right?

547
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,600
Do you know what this means?

548
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,680
- I know. It's a little insane.
- It's incredible.

549
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,478
If it's true...

550
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:35,050
My whole life, I've been...

551
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,730
making the case for the human
exploration of Mars, Mr. Taylor.

552
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:40,907
And this whole time...

553
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:43,046
my god.

554
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:49,443
I'm sorry. You'll have to
excuse me, it's a little...

555
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:51,789
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,960
Will you help us out doctor?

557
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,451
Absofuckinlutely!

558
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,800
