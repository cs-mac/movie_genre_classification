2
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,079
Mr Pochenko. go ahead. please.

3
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,679
Bobby. I must see you right away!

4
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,559
Hey. Professor! What's up?

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,959
Don't tell me - your study group
of conspiracy nuts

6
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,919
finally figured out who killed JFK. right?

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,839
Bobby. you were never
so disrespectful

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,759
when you were my student.

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,359
I MUST see you immediately.

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,159
I'll have Janet schedule a dinner.
It'd be great to catch up with you.

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,799
This is not backburner. Bobby.
I have to see you today!

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,279
When can you meet me?

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
You got a problem. tell me now
and I will take care of it.

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,759
This is not something
I can discuss on an unsecure phone.

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,239
Alright. Professor. I'll be home by 10:00.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,279
You come by then
and we'll talk about it. alright?

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,044
I'll be there.

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,279
I just wish we had more proof.

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,679
These names. the surveillance data
are just fragments.

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,599
You just have to convince Bishop.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,523
If he knows where to look.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,519
God!

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,010
I'm terrified.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,370
Very good. Neil. Keep searching.

25
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,602
I could take off!

26
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,399
Bobby. get off your ass!

27
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,890
Yeah. free shot! Here we go!

28
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,321
Nice shot! Watch the back door. man.

29
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,919
You. Bobby! It's all you!

30
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,319
Oh. no. no. I got it! Oh. yeah!

31
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,719
Let's go. let's go. let's go!
Here we go. here we go!

32
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,879
Time out. gentlemen.

33
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,530
Time out?

34
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,970
Bishop.

35
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,770
Don't tell me.

36
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,250
Alright. I'm on my way.

37
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,719
Yo. Bobby. Think your man could hook
the brothers up with some jobs?

38
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,359
I'll run it past him.

39
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,719
Soon as your contract
with the Bullets expires.

40
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,239
Fuckin' Bobby Bishop!

41
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,719
See you guys next Saturday.

42
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,529
Who'd have ever thought?

43
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
Thanks. guys!
You're welcome. Mr Bishop.

44
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,119
Sorry to bust up your day with this.

45
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,799
I finally get my jump shot back
and you call me in? What's up?

46
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,239
The redoubtable Bobby Bishop
not in the know?

47
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,719
That'll be the day.

48
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
Let me guess - you've seen
his draft of Monday's speech

49
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,919
and it's a little more than we expected?

50
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,399
"A little more" is hardly
the expression I would use.

51
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,119
Papers are gonna kill us.

52
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,043
Everybody's inside. Let's go.

53
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,681
Hello. everyone. Mr Vice President.

54
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,759
Alan.
Bobby.

55
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,039
James.

56
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,519
Robert!

57
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,119
Morning. Robert.
Charles.

58
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
Bobby. he's been up there all day
working on that speech.

59
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,919
He wants change - big change.

60
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,439
Yes. but what he wants is radical.
Too far-reaching.

61
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,639
It's gonna scare the hell
out of the financial markets.

62
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,919
He wants to freeze all government
contracts - not only that...

63
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,719
Make massive Defense cuts.

64
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,399
We're talking about millions
of people out of work overnight.

65
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,639
You know What that will do
to the stock exchange.

66
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,239
The man has created
an agenda for disaster.

67
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,759
It's far too much for the country
to handle all at once.

68
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,439
Not to mention a PR nightmare.

69
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
Since he won the election.
he's not listening to anybody.

70
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,599
It's as though
he were suddenly unaccountable.

71
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,159
He refuses to recognise
that change like this

72
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,319
has to be made step-by-step.
otherwise we'll be eaten alive

73
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,719
before we can get the American
public to understand and accept it.

74
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,239
And a draft of the speech
was leaked to the Herald'.

75
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,719
Who's writing the story?

76
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,999
Amanda Givens.

77
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,604
The perennial pain in the ass.

78
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,399
Certainly a persistent thorn in our sides.

79
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,039
Where is he now?
In the Office.

80
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,079
But he asked not to be disturbed
before dinner.

81
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,004
Well. I think I'd better go disturb him.

82
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,130
Bobby's the only one
who can get through to him.

83
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,879
Screw them.

84
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,884
These gutless bureaucrats.

85
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,039
They think this will bury the Party.

86
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,519
Do you agree?

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,199
Well. it is pretty risky.

88
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,639
A move this radical could send
the markets tumbling.

89
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,119
You don't know that.

90
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,599
Well. it could be.

91
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,599
But even if they drop.
It'll only be temporary.

92
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,679
My bet is in the long run
they'll be twice as strong.

93
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,159
Bobby. in my first term.

94
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,159
I listened to the experts.
I didn't rock the boat.

95
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,639
Well, I'm not gonna Wait any longer.

96
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,119
You don't have to convince me.

97
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
But you'll have a hell of a time
getting it through Congress.

98
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,959
I only have four years left.

99
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,879
If Congress doesn't like it.
there'll be a hell of a fight.

100
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,248
If I fail. I've failed trying.

101
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,931
Do I have to remind you
who helped draft this speech. Bobby?

102
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,599
I guess you're a little more daring

103
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,279
when you're 14 points behind
on the campaign trail

104
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,442
and half a bottle of Scotch
under your belt.

105
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
I just found out the story's
been leaked to the 'Herald'.

106
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,639
And with that much lead time.

107
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,599
There's a good chance
your opponents will massacre you

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,204
before you even get your ideas out.

109
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,399
Let me kill the story for now.

110
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,244
You can't sneak up on the enemy
when they know you're coming.

111
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,359
So how long do you Want me
to delay this speech?

112
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,439
Just a couple of days. sir. That's all.

113
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,930
Alright.

114
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,888
Good. I'll let them know.

115
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,399
Well?
He's agreed to reconsider for now.

116
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,999
Think you'll be able
to kill the story?

117
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,439
The Herald' goes to press in two hours.
The damage is done.

118
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,479
Well. like you said. sir.
we do have two hours.

119
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,959
That's not enough time.

120
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,611
It is for me. unless you'd rather
keep me here arguing about it.

121
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,919
Your boy is a confident
little prick. isn't he?

122
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,279
A prick? Really.

123
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,119
I find it so difficult
to distinguish between the...

124
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,487
...pricks and everyone else
around here.

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,730
Sir.

126
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,119
'Washington Herald'?

127
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,679
I have Senator Joseph Powers
calling for Amanda Givens.

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,719
Uh. Miss Givens
is out on assignment.

129
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,719
Hold. please.

130
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,688
Bobby. she's out on assignment.

131
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,679
You Wore that tie yesterday.

132
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,159
That was yesterday.

133
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,639
Does she no longer keep
her appointments

134
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,119
with United States senators?

135
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,599
This is an outrage.

136
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,999
Well. I'm sorry. sir.
but Amanda Givens is out of the office.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,199
She's interviewing Congressman Page.

138
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,679
She's got Nate Page. that fucking
snake. Grab his file. please.

139
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,639
You tell Miss Givens
we are extremely disappointed.

140
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,130
I'll tell her. sir.
Here we go.

141
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,645
I can smell it from here.

142
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,719
Get the press office
to call a conference at 6:45.

143
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,279
I want all the national
correspondents there.

144
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,839
I want the works.

145
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,479
6:45 is way too close.
The Herald' runs at 8:00.

146
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,199
Plenty of time. Make damn sure
Amanda Givens is there.

147
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,690
Alright. alright. I'm going.

148
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
Congressman Page's office.
May I help you?

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,079
Ja. this is Dr Schmenke.

150
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,999
It is imperative that I talk
to the Congressman immediately.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,685
He's in Committee Room 1312.
Danke!

152
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,959
Robert Bishop's office.

153
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,559
Bobby Bishop. please.

154
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,359
This is Yuri Pochenko calling.

155
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,364
Mr Bishop's unavailable.
He'll be back this evening.

156
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,359
Please! I must speak with him
immediately.

157
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,999
It cannot Wait until tonight.

158
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,359
Please! It is a matter of life or death.

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,839
I'm sorry. Professor.

160
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,679
When he returns.
I'll let him know you called.

161
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,759
Congressman Page.

162
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,999
What a coincidence.

163
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,211
Coincidence? Oh. I sincerely
doubt that. Mr Bishop.

164
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,641
Monday's speech?

165
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,719
I don't know quite what you're
talking about. Mr Bishop.

166
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,319
No idea.

167
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,839
Then I guess you're also unaware

168
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,559
of an additional base closure I'm
submitting to the Pentagon on Monday.

169
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,439
It happens to be in your district -
another coincidence. I suppose.

170
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,639
Yeah, 30,000 jobs is a career-buster
if I ever saw one.

171
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,326
You can't intimidate me. Mr Bishop.

172
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,161
Well. it's your choice. Congressman.

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,119
By the way. uh...

174
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,479
Are you still doinking
your legislative director

175
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,279
at the Crystal City Marriott?

176
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,359
Room 327. I think it was?

177
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,842
Yeah. I'd hate to have that leak out
on Monday as well.

178
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,604
- Hey. Mike.
- Mr Bishop.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,490
Next question.

180
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,159
Mr Bishop.
we've been hearing rumours

181
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,159
that the President is planning
radical change for his second term.

182
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,639
You've been hearing rumours.
have you?

183
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,119
The President will present his agenda

184
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,719
for the next four years
when he's ready

185
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,439
and I can guarantee
it will be rational, not radical.

186
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,441
Next question.

187
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,730
Excuse me! Excuse me.

188
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,839
The Herald' has it
from a very reliable source

189
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,079
that part of the President's plan
is a freeze on all government contracts.

190
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,559
Excuse me. miss.

191
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,007
That is yet another irresponsible
rumour I'd like to put an end to.

192
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,719
Name's Amanda Givens
and as I said. Mr Bishop.

193
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,769
We have it on a very reliable source.

194
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,359
Congressman Page.

195
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,039
Would you care
to address this rumour?

196
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
I'll be very happy
to address and terminate it.

197
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,962
Thank you. Bobby.

198
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,119
I've just come from
the President of the United States

199
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,079
and he has assured me that despite
small differences between us.

200
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,199
That from here on out it will be...

201
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,439
...business as usual.

202
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,399
Yes. Bobby!

203
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,399
Next question.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm gonna buy that little prick a drink.

205
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,359
Good evening. Robert.
Congressman Colbert.

206
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,408
Nice to see you.
Good to see you.

207
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,319
Yes. Senator Jones.
Good evening.

208
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,799
Good evening.
You have our support.

209
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,839
Did you get the bill passed?
We've got it done.

210
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,319
Hi, how are you'?

211
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,159
Oh. Oscar and Bertha!

212
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,003
How are you'?
Always a pleasure. Good!

213
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,999
Boy. oh. boy.
you are some kinda big shot!

214
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,159
I could have sworn
it was just last week

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,969
you were stuffing envelopes
and licking stamps.

216
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,610
That was last week.

217
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,170
It was. wasn't it?

218
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,810
Mmm.

219
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,999
You gotta try some of this vodka
the Finns sent us.

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,799
It's fantastic.

221
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,319
Couple of good shots
and you're Eric the Great.

222
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,759
Eric the Great never made it to 60.

223
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,439
I. on the other hand.
am alive and going strong

224
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,199
simply because
I have always restricted myself

225
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,599
to slowly sipping old reliable.

226
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,999
And eating apple pie.
Mm-hm.

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,759
And making love like a missionary.

228
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
And sailing that yacht of yours
around the Chesapeake.

229
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,759
I tell you. Bobby.
when I'm out on that bay.

230
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,839
All the crap that we go through every day

231
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,839
just to try and keep this country
from going under washes off me.

232
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,879
And I look back at that shore

233
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,599
and my mind is clear -
crystal clear.

234
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,519
And I rediscover Virginia
the way it used to be.

235
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,569
God. that sounds like
Thomas Jefferson. doesn't it?

236
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,519
Ah. Jake.

237
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,999
We kicked some butt today.

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,199
You did. Bobby.

239
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,279
He who gets the first sound bite wins.

240
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,199
Bobby. Bobby. Bobby.

241
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,999
You've learned faster and better
than anyone I've ever seen

242
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,599
how to play the game around here.

243
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,159
I think I feel some more
fatherly advice coming on.

244
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,799
Well. then listen up. son.

245
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,359
The ritual. the manoeuvring -
that's all it is. It's just a game.

246
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,839
And your precious sound bites?

247
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,439
They're like a drug. They get you high.

248
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,039
You think you've achieved something.
but in reality.

249
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,567
It's nothing but shallow.
superficial. pointless manipulation.

250
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,522
I wrote a lot of that speech
he was gonna give. Jake.

251
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,806
I know.

252
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,599
Want my car to give you a lift?

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,279
No. I'll just walk. thanks.

254
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,123
Get yourself mugged.

255
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,439
Tell Saxon it takes one to know one.

256
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,559
Call me.
I will.

257
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,199
Mr Bishop. we meet twice in one day!

258
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,039
God must be punishing me.

259
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,530
Hello. Amanda.

260
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,999
This is Jergon.
Jergon. this is Bobby Bishop.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,519
Gorgon, how are you'?
it's Jargon, pal.

262
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,010
Of course it is.

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,085
Jergon. would you
please see if our table is ready?

264
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,879
I'm curious. Bishop. What do
you have on Congressman Page. hmm?

265
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,799
Is he...doing
his legislative director? What?

266
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,564
I don't know what you're talking about.

267
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,799
You and I both know that
that story was true.

268
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,804
Story? Perhaps you could enlighten me.

269
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,319
Still terminally cute. I see.

270
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,244
I think the word is irresistible'.
Hmm.

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,679
Watch your back. Bishop.

272
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,839
I'm gonna screw you twice as bad
as you screwed me today.

273
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,127
Gives me something to look
forward to now. doesn't it?

274
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,799
And stop referring to me as 'miss
on national television.

275
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,246
I didn't know that that bothered you. miss.

276
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,319
Bobby!
Jesus. Professor!

277
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,719
You scared the hell out of me!
I thought we said 10:00.

278
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,199
Bobby. you must listen to me.

279
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,679
Something terrible is happening

280
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,279
inside the government
at the highest level.

281
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,681
There's an enemy within - a traitor.

282
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,239
Come on. Professor!

283
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,730
Bobby. there's a shadow...

284
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,330
Professor!

285
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,605
Get down. Get down!

286
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,770
A man's been shot!

287
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,690
Hold the door. please. sir.

288
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,689
Don't burn it. pal.

289
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,079
Goodnight.
have a good weekend.

290
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,321
Have a good weekend
Yeah. what's left of it.

291
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,639
Bishop on line two for you. sir.

292
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,130
OK. I gotta go. 'Bye.

293
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,919
Hey. your date lose
the handcuff keys?

294
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,679
Jake. listen to me. I've been shot at.

295
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,839
There's some fuck roaming
the streets trying to kill me.

296
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,239
Don't call her a fuck. Bobby.
she's probably a very nice girl.

297
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,164
This is not a joke.
They killed Yuri Pochenko.

298
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,759
Where are you? I'll come get you.

299
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,359
Meet me at the Georgetown Theatre.
15 minutes.

300
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,964
Make it 10.

301
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I need a car and every man
you can spare.

302
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,929
Whoa. Jake. let's not make
a production out of this.

303
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,439
Special Assistant to the President
says that he's been shot at.

304
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,039
But this administration can't
afford an incident like this.

305
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,611
His safety is my concern. sir.

306
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,130
There he is.

307
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,641
Bobby!

308
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,926
Jesus!

309
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,599
We've got two civilians

310
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,079
and two agents dead on the scene.

311
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,159
<i>The shooter got down
the back fire-escape.</i>

312
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,719
And Bobby. did anyone see
if Bobby Bishop was hit?

313
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,961
No. he wasn't.
Thank God for that.

314
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,446
This country is falling apart.

315
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,090
Bishop is on line one.

316
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,930
Bobby?

317
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,719
Bobby. are you there?

318
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,519
What the hell happened back there?

319
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,399
We don't know. Are you alright?
Where are you?

320
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,879
Close by.

321
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,759
Jake. Pochenko gets blown away

322
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,239
after making these wild accusations

323
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,199
about something going on in the
government in the highest levels.

324
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,679
Then some zombie
with a gun goes after me.

325
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,159
I call you and there's someone there

326
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,639
waiting to take a shot at me.

327
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,279
It doesn't take a genius to figure out

328
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,279
that something really fucked up
is going on here.

329
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,279
Well. somebody set us up. Bobby.

330
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,439
Literally in 10 minutes they set us up.

331
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,159
You have to come in.
Tell us where you are.

332
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,279
No. Bobby. what did
Pochenko say exactly?

333
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,239
He just said that something was
going on at the highest level.

334
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,039
Something about us
watching each other.

335
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,202
He said there was this program
that pointed to it.

336
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,079
What does that mean?

337
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,799
I don't have a fucking clue.

338
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,879
It's your move. Bobby.

339
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,839
I need some time.

340
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,684
You Wait. I'll find you.

341
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,967
We should call the FBI
and the DC police.

342
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,722
That's the President's decision.

343
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,999
Who did this?

344
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,879
Answers. gentlemen.

345
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,839
He's a Special Assistant
to the President. goddammit.

346
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,879
What are you doing to stop this?

347
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,519
Mr President. we're dealing with
a highly trained killer here.

348
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,999
We're combing through all our people

349
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,479
in the intelligence community.

350
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,239
Yes. but what puzzles me
is why Bishop?

351
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,799
Out of all our senior officials.
why go after him?

352
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,768
Is he involved with something?

353
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,399
Bishop's integrity is not in question.

354
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Get him off the street and get
to the bottom of this - quietly.

355
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,159
Bobby needs more time. sir.
until he can...

356
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,679
Until he gets himself killed.

357
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,159
Come on. Jake.

358
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,359
We gotta bring him in
now before this goes any further.

359
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,879
I agree entirely. for
Bishop's own welfare.

360
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,327
Sir. we're ready for you.

361
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,242
I'll be at Camp David.

362
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,885
He trusts you like a father. Jake.
He's a good kid.

363
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,408
Bring him in safely - whether
he wants to come in or not.

364
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,044
Blythe.
Yes. sir.

365
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,089
No FBI. We'll handle this ourselves.

366
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,759
Yeah.
Frank. it's Bobby.

367
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,239
I need to talk to you.

368
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,039
Bobby. if this is an apology
for smothering the story.

369
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,519
Don't bother.

370
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,399
Remember the article
you ran last spring

371
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,159
on the theory of a shadow government
inside the White House?

372
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,039
I need to talk to your sources.

373
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,839
Bobby. you said
that article was absurd.

374
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,519
Why do you need my sources?

375
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,719
For starters. I don't think it's a theory.

376
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,959
Four or five people are already dead.

377
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,999
Now I've got some lunatic chasing
me with a gun. How's that?

378
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,199
Why'?

379
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,679
I need those sources. Frank.

380
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,239
That's not an exclusive. Bobby.

381
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,839
How long do you need?
I need two or three hours.

382
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,840
I gotta get to my office. Meet
me at the News Cafe. 5:00am.

383
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,399
It's right across from my office.

384
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,050
OK.

385
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,359
The line Bishop just called is dialling out.

386
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,125
Trace it and keep tabs
on Bishop's line.

387
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,399
Listen, Jargon, no means no.

388
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,970
Hey. hey. hey. no. it's Frank.

389
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,319
Oh. hi. boss.

390
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,959
Sorry.

391
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,519
Listen. Amanda. that conspiracy
piece you wrote last spring?

392
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,599
I need you to contact
your sources tonight.

393
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,799
Bobby Bishop says
he can confirm that story.

394
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,279
He what?

395
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,239
Meet me at my office - now.

396
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,129
Alright.

397
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,883
Ah. here it is.

398
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,159
Givens. Amanda.

399
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,084
125836th Street North-West.

400
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,479
Hey. man. give me a dollar.

401
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,970
Dick!

402
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,330
Professor?

403
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,610
Mrs Olson?

404
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,128
Professor Pochenko'?

405
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,439
Earlier tonight.

406
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,359
Area residents were shaken by
the sound of gunfire in Georgetown.

407
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,959
One man is reported dead
and several are said to be wounded.

408
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,599
The names of the victims
have not been released.

409
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,879
Police have blamed the shoot-out
in front of the Georgetown Theatre

410
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,439
on rival gang wars.

411
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,679
And now. in other news.

412
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,879
Fifth-graders at a school in
Greenfield. Massachusetts...

413
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,167
Rival gang wars my ass.

414
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,319
Bad night. huh?

415
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,810
The worst.

416
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,730
Thanks.

417
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,529
Old Buzz hung-over again. is he?

418
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,599
Good
morning - it's two minutes after the hour

419
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,559
and this is the Sunday
morning news round-up.

420
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,439
I'm Bella Chambers and these
are the headlines today.

421
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,568
In Washington. the President...

422
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,599
Amanda!

423
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,759
Eugh. Bad date. huh?

424
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,922
I hear you've got a hot story for me?

425
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,039
You wrote the article?

426
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,519
Yeah.

427
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,999
Yeah. I got a story for you...

428
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,650
...if your sources are good.

429
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,845
Frank's office is this way.

430
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,482
Hey. Frank.

431
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,079
Frank.

432
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,367
Frank!
Come on, Frank, Wake up, will you'?

433
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,770
Come on.

434
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,850
Come on!

435
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,119
Sweet Jesus.

436
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,599
Sir. we need some help here.

437
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,599
No. no. no!

438
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,410
Go!

439
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,479
What just happened?

440
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,005
Who are your sources?

441
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,886
Bobby. what just happened?
Was it Pochenko?

442
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,999
I'm not telling you my sources
until you tell me what just happened.

443
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,479
Pochenko is dead.

444
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,199
The same guy that just tried
to kill us shot him in the head.

445
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,759
He died in my fucking arms last night.

446
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,239
Jesus!

447
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,279
Pochenko tried to tell me some wild story

448
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,199
about a traitor in the government.

449
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,639
He started to say something -
something about a shadow.

450
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,802
You gotta talk to me. Amanda.

451
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,039
Yeah. it was Pochenko
and his study group.

452
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,199
They have this database

453
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,599
that correlates everything
that our public officials do.

454
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,439
If there's any evidence of bribery
or misuse of government funds

455
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,919
or inter-agency misconduct -
stuff like that -

456
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,399
then this program will find it.

457
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,209
And they call it “Shadow”!

458
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,599
I don't know.

459
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,359
After Frank's phone call. I tried
to get in touch with him -

460
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,010
even drove out to the retreat.

461
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,239
Nobody was there. It was weird.

462
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,079
The place wiped clean. Hard drives
gone from the computers.

463
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,559
Check this out -
I call the White House

464
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,119
to make arrangements to go in -

465
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,999
someone's there waiting
to put a bullet in my ass.

466
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,322
Then I call Frank at home.
I figured that...

467
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,445
Oh. sonofabitch!

468
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,690
They're monitoring my calls.

469
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
DC police are saying that.

470
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,559
So far. the associate editor's death

471
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,239
looks to be an apparent homicide.

472
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,839
More details as they develop.

473
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,679
Ridell's computer was wiped clean.

474
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,207
Metro Police tell me there were
no cordite traces on his hands.

475
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,879
Mr Grasso. what is
taking you so long?

476
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,359
It's Sunday morning

477
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,119
and we're not exactly installing
a Xerox machine here.

478
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,159
Precisely because
it is Sunday morning

479
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,879
you should be able to
get things done more quickly.

480
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,359
NSA isn't the same without you. Jake.

481
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,799
Isn't this a little down and dirty
for the White House Chief of Staff?

482
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,439
Bobby Bishop is my personal
responsibility.

483
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,279
Never thought we'd be using
our mobile system

484
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,959
to track down the great Bobby Bishop.

485
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,239
Alright. here's the deal.

486
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,999
We fed this baby
every contact Bishop has

487
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,599
in the three-state area.

488
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,639
If Bishop calls any one of these
people from any phone.

489
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,679
This computer will identify
his voice instantaneously.

490
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,159
Likewise if they call him.

491
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,159
It's kinda like putting a tap
on 1.500 people all at one time.

492
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,999
It's amazing. Amazing shit.

493
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,639
I know. I designed it.

494
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,719
Now sing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy'.
Mr Grasso.

495
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,799
Doesn't he remind you
of James Cagney?

496
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,199
Sir. you need to take a look at this.

497
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,879
DC police just got us this tape.

498
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,919
Bishop entered with
an unidentified woman

499
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,239
three minutes before
Ridell was killed.

500
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,719
They're looking for him
for questioning.

501
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,210
I've got a detective on the line now.

502
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,571
Tell him whereabouts unknown.

503
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,371
Wake up. Mr Blythe.

504
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,284
Searching the subject's vehicle.

505
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,959
Excuse me. I'd like to ask you
a few questions. please.

506
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,999
Sure thing.
Do you live in the neighbourhood?

507
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,479
Yeah.

508
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,879
We're trying to locate a neighbour
of yours - Robert Bishop.

509
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,370
Did you happen to see him?

510
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,279
Yeah.

511
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,839
Take a walk.

512
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,159
14th Street Bridge underpass.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

513
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,039
The President wants me
to get you to come home.

514
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,565
I'll see you at the underpass.

515
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,330
Bobby?

516
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,610
Hey. Jake!

517
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,119
I don't know what you've
gotten yourself into.

518
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,039
But the DC Police have you there
when Ridell was murdered.

519
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,519
If they ever find out

520
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,999
that you were also there
with Yuri Pochenko.

521
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,199
I mean. circumstantially you're...
I don't know.

522
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,359
Pochenko tried to warn me

523
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,039
about something going on
at the White House.

524
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,519
Maybe he picked something up

525
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,319
out of one of our computers -
I don't know.

526
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,359
If the problem is on the inside.

527
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,479
What are you doing on the outside
running around?

528
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,199
Come on. Bobby.

529
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,839
The only thing you can get out here
is arrested or killed.

530
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,119
I'm not coming in -
not till we dig this bastard out.

531
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,770
Are you gonna help me. or not?

532
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,759
Yeah. of course I'm gonna help.
You're making it very hard.

533
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,759
Give me a secure line.
Er. 569.5683.

534
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,239
I'll be in touch...
83.

535
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,730
...I promise.

536
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,290
It's not good.

537
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,770
It's not good at all.

538
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,370
Somebody's trying to implicate me.

539
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,639
I wrote down everything
I could remember

540
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,239
about Pochenko's study group.

541
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,719
And I came up with something.

542
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,039
He used to work at his girlfriend's
apartment sometimes.

543
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,959
Remember her? Tamara?

544
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,439
Yeah. of course.

545
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,479
He always said that he did
his best thinking there.

546
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,119
You know where it is?

547
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,439
Over on Calvert Street.

548
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,408
Better get there before they do.

549
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,639
You alright?

550
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,519
They're gonna come for us again.
aren't they? Wherever we are.

551
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,519
Do you want the truth?

552
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,127
No. lie to me. You were always
so much better at that.

553
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,725
Hey. sir. you better take
a look at this.

554
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,842
How do you fit into
all of this. Miss Rashov?

555
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,761
She was Yuri Pochenko's
significant other.

556
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,044
Still no answer at Tamara's.

557
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,608
Sit still. There's a trick to it.

558
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,759
Thanks.

559
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,559
If you see anything
that looks suspicious.

560
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,799
Anyone that could be a killer.
honk the horn twice.

561
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,759
What's a killer look like?

562
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,250
Use your instincts.

563
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,799
Are you looking for me. please?
I am Tamara Raschova.

564
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,370
May I help? you, please'?

565
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,970
Hey. hey. what the hell is this?

566
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,919
Start the car!

567
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,729
Start the car!

568
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,209
Drive! Drive!

569
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,119
Jesus!

570
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,610
Drive!

571
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,041
Bobby!

572
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,010
Bobby!

573
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,999
Good driving. Miss Givens.

574
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,844
You found something?
Yeah.

575
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,519
I found Tamara dead

576
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,683
and a list of names that
Pochenko was investigating.

577
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,680
Grasso. the police
reports are starting to come in.

578
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,279
Sir. you'd better
take a look at this.

579
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,359
There's a homicide
over on Calvert Street.

580
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,199
The deceased is that Tamara Rashov.
Description fits Bishop.

581
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,559
Witness saw him drive off
with somebody in a jeep.

582
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,050
Did police get the plates?

583
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,879
That's a negatory.

584
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,167
Just got a partial plate number -
enough to start a trace.

585
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,519
I tell you.
Bishop's turning into a death train.

586
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,399
Everywhere he stops. people die.

587
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,279
Keep your brilliant metaphors
to yourself, will you, Charlie?

588
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,727
And 'negatory' is not an English word.

589
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,039
OK. we're tracking onto him.

590
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,239
Check. Moving forward.

591
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,519
- Alright...let's get started.
- Roger that. 61

592
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,519
We got the make and model
and a partial plate.

593
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,759
I want a cross-reference
of all of Bishop's associates

594
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,410
who have similar vehicles.

595
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,399
Seems like old times. huh?

596
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,644
You never took me
anywhere this nice.

597
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,879
How does it feel?

598
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,247
How does it look?
Pretty bad.

599
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,481
Secretary Murphy...
General Blackburn.

600
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,519
Chairman Cutler?

601
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,199
This is insane!

602
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,851
And what do these names
have in common?

603
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,129
You don't think one of these
could be a traitor?

604
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,489
Always keep a file.

605
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,039
What?

606
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,567
It's something Conrad taught me.
I got files on all these guys.

607
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,759
Oh...let me guess where.

608
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,639
Yeah.

609
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,239
Call Conrad. have him do it.

610
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,999
No.

611
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,040
Whoever's behind all this is probably
monitoring the entire White House.

612
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,719
Call Jake. he could be the next victim.

613
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,879
Sir. there's been another murder.

614
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,679
And Bobby has been placed
at the scene of this one too.

615
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,599
DC police have an all-point bulletin
out for him.

616
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,439
What about someone
trying to discredit him. frame him?

617
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,679
Mr President.
I've called the CIA. NSA.

618
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,519
Give me something. people.

619
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,719
They've got nothing for us.

620
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,919
Yes. but we can't
rule out the possibility

621
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,399
that Bishop's been turned
by one of our enemies.

622
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,999
We should not rule anything out.

623
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,079
Jake. what do you think?

624
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,919
We have to get him in here. sir.
Then we'll find out what's going on.

625
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,526
Alright. goodnight.
Goodnight. sir.

626
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,159
It's funny how 24 hours in this town

627
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,527
can put you on the other
side of the fence.

628
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,959
If they're smart.
they've kept their search internal.

629
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,679
That's how Jake would do it.

630
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,719
If not. they're following Saxon's lead.

631
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,919
And the guards will be looking for us.

632
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,559
Now. if we make it past the guards.

633
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,882
Once we get inside. they will enter
my name on the in-house computer.

634
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,721
If that system's being monitored. we
could have as little as five minutes.

635
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,251
Amanda..you can bail out
if you want to.

636
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,599
No. you need me...don't you?

637
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,639
I'd give us about a 50/50 chance.

638
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,919
You never could say it.

639
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,400
Let's cut the chit-chat. alright?

640
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,359
ID please.
Mr Bishop. Amanda Givens.

641
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,039
'Washington Herald'. B5.

642
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,441
OK.

643
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,719
Remember. you gotta see what happens
after they enter my name. OK?

644
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,199
OK.

645
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,601
If the screen starts flashing.
get out of there.

646
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,279
May I help you. ma'am?
Hi.

647
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,199
Robert Bishop wanted
to see me right away.

648
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,679
He said that maybe you could
find him for me? Is that possible?

649
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,170
May I see some ID. please?

650
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,162
I'll see where the system has him.

651
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,399
Oh! So sorry.
That's quite alright.

652
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,607
I do this 100 times a day.

653
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,279
Bishop hasn't been logged in
on my watch.

654
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,999
OK, then...I'll Wait.

655
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,764
Thanks.

656
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,090
Yes?

657
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,799
Hiya. George. How are you?

658
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,359
OK. What happened with you?
Catch another elbow?

659
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,719
Two elbows. George.
You have a visitor waiting.

660
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,399
There you are. I've been
looking for you.

661
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,199
How's the wife?
Doing fine. Mr Bishop. thanks.

662
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,839
Good. glad to hear it.

663
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,559
Be sure to send her
my best. would you?

664
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,719
I'm sorry.

665
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,239
Should I just...leave this here?
Yes. please.

666
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,891
Come on. Miss Givens.
We don't have all day.

667
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,771
How'd the O's do. Mike?
Not so well. Mr Bishop.

668
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,079
Anything else?
Check this over for typos.

669
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,559
Yes. sir.

670
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:55,519
And...let Richard look over this paper
before you send it out.

671
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,079
Yes. sir. Very good.

672
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,401
I talked to Congressman Myers...

673
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,519
I got you. baby!

674
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,359
Amanda Givens - 1A1 142.
Got your ass!

675
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,169
You're mine now.

676
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,719
Chief of Staff Conrad.

677
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,799
You've forgotten your password
again. haven't you?

678
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,279
No shit.

679
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,919
Have your assistant
call NSC Security.

680
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,799
Save your data. End query.
Terminating in two minutes.

681
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,959
How will you get in?

682
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,439
Conrad once showed me
a back door into this database.

683
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,799
He changed the password every week
and he would tend to forget it.

684
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,644
So if I can just remember it...

685
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,010
Bingo.

686
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,766
OK. Attorney General Toyanbee.
let's see what they've got on you.

687
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,439
Look at this.
Classified.

688
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,330
It's active classified.
Try Oliver Murphy.

689
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,519
It's the same.
Lawrence Blackburn.

690
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,683
Lawrence Blackburn. Shit.

691
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,119
Hey. Jake. did you log on
to the NSC secure database?

692
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,599
I'm here. Mr Grasso. I'm here with you.

693
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,119
How could I possibly log on to
whatever it is you're talking about?

694
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,487
Well. somebody did.
and they're using your name.

695
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,839
Check it out.
Doesn't look good to me.

696
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,604
I'll try one more name.

697
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,768
What is this?

698
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,079
Transfer list. Transfer to what?

699
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,959
There's a separate directory
just for me.

700
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,442
Damn. Call Conrad - 5683.

701
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,199
5683.
Jake.

702
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,999
Bobby. I've been ordered
to bring you in. Where are you?

703
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,319
Get this.

704
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,839
Three of our top cabinet officials

705
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,359
have active files
in the classified NSC database.

706
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,439
Active files?
What's that mean - active?

707
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,919
Why am I under surveillance?

708
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,159
What? You're not under surveillance.

709
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,599
It's in your goddamn computer. Jake.

710
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,999
Bobby. you're not under surveillance.

711
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,799
It's in the goddamn NSC database.
Somebody's gotta know about this.

712
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,079
Well. I for sure don't. for Christ's sake.

713
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,199
How can I know anything about it?

714
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,799
I can't even remember my...
vvhat's-it-called.

715
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,199
I'm a computer illiterate.

716
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,730
Jake. he's in the building.
Go get him.

717
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,519
We gotta move. Come on.

718
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,646
Come on!

719
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,879
It's available.
let's get him out there.

720
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,281
Activate the silent alarm.

721
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,799
Shit. silent alarm.

722
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,479
This guy's a piece of work. huh?

723
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,802
He's a very bright young man.

724
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,568
Switch to secure frequency.

725
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,079
Halt! Stay where you are or we will fire!

726
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,287
Halt!

727
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,803
They're on the roof.
Have accessed rooftop area.

728
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,170
Come on. Come on! Follow me.

729
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,764
Careful. it's slippery.

730
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,167
Through the skylight. Rawlings.
Open the door.

731
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,566
Bobby!

732
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,049
Let's not move.

733
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,199
For God's sake. son!

734
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,884
Come on!

735
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,883
Yes. alright.

736
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,319
They're down here somewhere.

737
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,924
Bring the elevator up -
we'll flush him out.

738
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,886
See him?!
No! "

739
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,169
I'm bringing it back up!

740
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,330
Come on.

741
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,810
Come on!

742
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,599
Get in.

743
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,119
Don't make me tell you again.

744
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,759
I said get in!

745
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,679
Move it!
Get your hands off me. asshole.

746
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,603
Where's Bishop?

747
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,879
You're such a big boy -
find him yourself.

748
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,959
Where is he?

749
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,850
I said where is he?!

750
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,690
Get out!

751
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,284
Bobby!

752
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,799
Don't touch the cables!
Bobby!

753
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,167
Here. Amanda!

754
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,130
Come on. come on!

755
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,322
- Pull back!
- Grab him!

756
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,650
Come on.

757
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,523
Damn it! Sonofabitch!

758
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,759
Him and his nice wife

759
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,839
and that lovely home in
the rolling hills of old Virginia.

760
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,559
It was him all along.

761
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,199
I believed in that bastard.

762
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,839
He had Pochenko killed.

763
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,479
We know Conrad's in charge
of this shadow program.

764
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,039
Now we gotta find out
what they're up to.

765
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,039
If you pour water in the hole.
the rat will come out.

766
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,122
This rat swims.

767
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,279
DC police are putting out
an all-points bulletin

768
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,959
for Bishop and Amanda Givens
for questioning in these homicides.

769
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,439
Grasso. I want you to feed

770
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,199
Amanda Givens automobile specs
into the keyhole satellites.

771
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,279
Now.
To find a car?

772
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,279
Jesus. I'd have to pull satellites
off operations in Cuba.

773
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,759
Maybe even the Middle East.

774
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,359
We'd have to get
a written authorisation from...

775
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,239
From me! From me!
I am authorising it!

776
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,766
I'll Write it clown for you!
Now do it! Now!

777
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,279
We've got company.

778
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,726
I can get us in
through the back alley.

779
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,079
What's up?

780
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,719
Apartments are clear -
let's get out of here.

781
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,199
Call it in.

782
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,839
Base? We're movin' on.

783
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,759
I've got some infra-red film
and a long lens.

784
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,603
Over here.

785
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,125
Sir. we're resolving grid A4.

786
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,086
Look. the license matches.
It's Amanda Givens. Jake?

787
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,439
Where is it?

788
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,119
On the street.
two blocks from her apartment.

789
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,122
Blythe. move your men on this now.

790
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,002
Oh. good. I'm starving.

791
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,599
You got any friends in the building?

792
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,239
Yeah. a few.
Any that'll lend you a car?

793
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,483
I'm not sure I would call it a car.

794
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,930
8273.

795
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,959
Conrad.

796
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,089
Yes. Mr Conrad.
I'm sure you know who this is.

797
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,039
No. I don't. Am I supposed to guess?

798
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,879
Well. we almost met on the White
House roof earlier this evening.

799
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,559
I'm running a story based on
a theory by Professor Yuri Pochenko

800
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,039
and his associates.

801
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,519
On government dishonesty?

802
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,719
Oh! I'm sorry. did I say theory?

803
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,720
I meant fact. Mr Conrad. based on
what I witnessed this evening.

804
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,039
I thought maybe you would like to
comment before it hits the presses.

805
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,679
Traditionally. it's been my policy
not to comment to the press.

806
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,239
Because it is my conviction
that the press prints to sell.

807
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,599
It doesn't print to inform.
It doesn't print the truth.

808
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,519
I have a rather good source. Mr Conrad.

809
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,519
His name is Bobby Bishop. You do
know Bobby Bishop. don't you. sir?

810
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,730
Yes. of course I know Bobby Bishop.
And I will stand by him.

811
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,199
We didn't get it.

812
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,679
Did he bite?

813
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,999
I don't know.
He did a lot of dancing.

814
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,446
Leave me alone. will you. please?
Yes.

815
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,168
Let's get some fresh air. shall we?

816
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,490
It's Conrad.

817
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,683
Mr Blythe.
Yeah.

818
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,289
These people lent them their van.

819
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,481
It usually clears my head
being down here.

820
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,439
How's your back?

821
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,719
I'm having a disc
reconstructed in two months.

822
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,959
The goddamn thing has
ruined my golf swing.

823
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,450
I'm sorry about that.

824
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,759
You're late.

825
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,240
I'm not used to driving myself.

826
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,719
Well. Jake...
I think.

827
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,799
You said to me two hours ago
that Bishop was no problem to us.

828
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,719
No. I said he was not yet
aware of our scenario.

829
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,639
But now. with that -
what did you call her? -

830
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,244
pain in the ass Givens...

831
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:45,599
I think We should rethink.
Perhaps We should Wait and regroup.

832
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,159
He who hesitates is lost.

833
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,999
I can't believe you said that.

834
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,719
Those were exactly
the words you used

835
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,399
when we discussed
this the first time.

836
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,079
We've run out of time. Jake.

837
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,759
The target returns
from Camp David at 7:00.

838
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,959
The future of the country
is in our hands.

839
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,479
We may never have another
opportunity like this again.

840
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,970
Never.

841
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,079
Like the poor cat in the adage.

842
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,971
The cat Wanted to grab the fish
but didn't Want to get its paws Wet.

843
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,999
Today...

844
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,759
...at noon...

845
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,250
...as planned...

846
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,730
...we assassin...

847
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,130
What was that?

848
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,290
You spooking out on us. Jake?

849
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,679
Saxon.

850
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,170
Hey. you got some sun.
Thanks. Jake.

851
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,399
We have to go...

852
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,199
...go over
the Bobby Bishop problem

853
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,690
and your children's
fundraiser speech.

854
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,479
If you call the White House. they'll
trace it and be onto us in seconds.

855
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,847
If I can talk to him directly.
that won't matter.

856
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,370
Saxon.

857
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,606
Hello.

858
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,931
Who is this?

859
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,439
We got the
license plate number

860
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,159
from the neighbours
who lent them their van.

861
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,919
We have the keyhole satellite
tracking the van

862
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,439
as well as a ground tracker.

863
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,681
I guarantee we'll have their
asses within the hour.

864
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,279
God. Bobby. What are we gonna do?

865
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,079
If I can get to Conrad.
there's a chance I can stop him

866
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,959
if he thinks we have a tape
of the conversation.

867
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,119
Which. of course. we don't have.

868
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,645
Conrad doesn't know that.

869
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,439
Sir. we have another van.

870
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,239
Go with the license plates.

871
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,319
OK. Go. More. More.

872
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,359
Tighter. Tighter. Good. and lock.

873
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,519
That's it! That's our mouse.
That's our freaking mouse.

874
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,719
We got him! We got Bishop!
Where? Where is he?

875
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,759
He just parked the van
on Connecticut at P Street.

876
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,039
Alright. attention all units.
Connecticut and P.

877
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,879
I could go to Adams Hall

878
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,839
and if you don't
find Conrad. I could...

879
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,239
...try and hold up
the speech or something.

880
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,319
How?
I don't know.

881
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,279
I'm sure you'll think of something.

882
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,039
Alright.

883
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,530
Hey. Amanda.

884
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,488
You were right. I do need you.

885
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,039
Be careful.

886
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,963
K6 is moving out of range.

887
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,530
Come on. I got you.

888
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,079
Yeah. those look good.

889
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,759
Give me a hat. will you?
Sure thing. my man.

890
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,489
Thanks.

891
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,970
Keep it.
Thanks.

892
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,719
Stay on him.

893
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,199
Come on.

894
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,439
Come on! We're right on his ass.

895
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,249
Stay on him.

896
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,127
Where the hell is he?
I just had him.

897
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,163
Let's move. people.

898
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,119
Unit 22. we have
south-east corner locked.

899
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,566
DC patrol blocking
the corner of Connecticut...

900
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,690
They're waiting for you. sir.

901
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,759
Feeling alright?

902
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,762
Fine. Everything's just fine.

903
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,762
I'll be there in a minute.

904
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,599
Hey! Hey!

905
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,119
Drive.

906
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,599
OK. Where to?
Adams Hall.

907
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,090
Hurry!

908
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,210
Goddammit!

909
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,130
Jesus Christ!

910
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,959
You're paying for that window.

911
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,043
Can't you drive any faster?
You want me to get a ticket too?

912
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,239
What are you doing?
This ain't Adams Hall.

913
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,959
Uh-uh. with friends like you got.

914
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,644
You're taking the train. motherfucker.

915
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,530
Get out of my damn cab!

916
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,563
Out of the way!

917
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,525
Mr Conrad.

918
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,039
Testing. Testing.
One. two. three. four.

919
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,249
Testing. One. two. three. four.

920
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,839
Here you go.

921
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,330
And this?
Mm-hm.

922
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,050
What happened?

923
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,999
I didn't make it to Conrad.

924
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,719
Oh. God. He just went in.

925
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,563
A minute to go.

926
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,159
I've got to get inside.
I've got an idea.

927
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,199
Good luck. Bishop.

928
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,399
Amanda! Wait!

929
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,289
Shit!

930
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,399
What? Hey! Wait!

931
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,484
Bring her down!

932
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,559
I need to see the President.

933
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,040
He's my father. the President!

934
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,289
He's my real father!

935
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,210
Call it off.

936
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,359
I can't. It's too late.
It's out of my hands.

937
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,839
<i>It's a fait accompli.</i>

938
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,519
Stay out of it. Bobby.
You'll get yourself killed.

939
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,359
What did you do it for?
What was in it for you?

940
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,360
Not for me. for Christsakes.
Not for me. For this country.

941
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,039
For everybody in it. For you.

942
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,199
For that stupid journalist
friend of yours.

943
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,799
Bullshit!

944
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,639
Saxon's a patsy.

945
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,039
You're gonna be running
the country. right?

946
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,959
Somebody has to run it.
that's for sure.

947
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,639
Somebody is. The President.

948
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,479
He's a madman. Bobby.

949
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,679
There are still a few people
that voted for him. remember?

950
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,239
Because they fell for
your fucking sound bites.

951
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,639
You said that I'd never believe
in anything enough to go down for it.

952
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,559
You were wrong.

953
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,679
Bobby.
You were wrong!

954
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,682
Bobby. Bobby.

955
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,362
Oh. God.

956
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,288
Get down! Get down!

957
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,850
Thanks. Bobby.
You alright?

958
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,890
Look out!

959
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,999
Get him out of here. Come on.
Let's get him out of here.

960
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,765
Move it. Come on. Move.
Move. everybody.

961
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,879
An inside source tells me Bobby
Bishop turned down Chief of Staff

962
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,599
to head the President's
new jobs program.

963
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,079
Really?
Yeah.

964
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,599
Is the source reliable?

965
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,759
Hmm...

966
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,410
We'll see.

967
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,643
Come on. I'll buy you a Popsicle.

968
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,519
Is the star reporter offering
a bribe to one of her best sources?

969
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,079
Oh. you know something. Bishop?

970
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,559
I may just be starting to like you.

971
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,210
Again?
