1
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,735
Hello.

2
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,612
They call me doom-head.

3
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:29,481
Now, I don't call myself
doom-head, mind you, but they do.

4
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,220
Who's they?

5
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:39,893
Well, some mysterious folks that pay me
a whole lot of scratch to do what I do.

6
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,929
And what I do,
unfortunately for you...

7
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,633
I do real well.

8
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,038
Now.

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,076
Let's get one thing
between us straight.

10
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:06,252
I ain't no fucking clown.

11
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:11,390
Now Mr. p.T. Barnum may claim clowns are
the pegs on which this circus is hung...

12
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,429
But I isn't no fucking clown.

13
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,203
Now you may think you see a grease-painted
performer sitting before you

14
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,807
who would usually elicit an
amused response from an audience,

15
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,174
but trust me.

16
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,077
You do not.

17
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,914
I'm not here to make you happy.

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,820
I'm not here to brighten
your dismal day

19
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:45,757
and I am certainly not here
to elicit an amused response.

20
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,596
I am here to end your
miserable fucking life.

21
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,169
But first...

22
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,715
First,

23
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,152
I'm gonna bless
you with a story.

24
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,294
See I don't think the last sound to
puncture your ear drums should be

25
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,330
the twang of your
body falling apart.

26
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:28,034
Snap!

27
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,935
Crunch.

28
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,575
Interesting fact:

29
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:41,680
Did you know that a cockroach can
live up to 168 hours without a head?

30
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,621
I find this... fascinating.

31
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,595
But what really blows
my fucking marbles

32
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,832
like a 50-cent skank,

33
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,436
I mean the real mind-fucker,

34
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,840
is that for several more hours
this same decapitated head

35
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,011
will keep on truckin' for Jesus.

36
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,113
If properly
nourished, of course.

37
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,387
You know, all in all, you've
had a pretty good run.

38
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,826
But, deep down inside you must have
known it all had to end somewhere.

39
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,731
Might as well be here.
Might as well be now.

40
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,867
And it might as well be with me.

41
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:41,808
Where's my wife? What did you sick
bastards do to my beautiful wife?

42
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,577
She's the mother of our
two beautiful girls.

43
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:49,047
Rebecca, Josephine, they're beautiful,
they're just like her, please.

44
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,019
I know where she is.

45
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,559
Two little clowns I know
took a fancy to her.

46
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,596
So I think she might be
sticking around for a bit?

47
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,899
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death I fear no evil...

48
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,906
Christ almighty, you Jesus
freaks are so fucking sensitive?

49
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,410
Shit.

50
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,680
You should be thanking me, man.

51
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:26,952
I'm sending you straight to the fucking
pearly gates with a first-class ticket.

52
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,337
I should apologize in advance
for not sharpening this thing.

53
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,510
It might take a couple
of extra whacks.

54
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,413
Listen to me. Listen to me, please,
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

55
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:59,185
You don't have... You
don't have to do this.

56
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:04,690
We can all walk away.
Bring Georgina to me.

57
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,959
And you let us walk away,
no one would know.

58
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,861
- Fuck it.
- No, no.

59
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,263
You know what they say,
kemosabe, in hell,

60
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,735
everybody loves popcorn.

61
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,016
Number fucking two.

62
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,351
Hey Randy, man, i hope you know that
"e" stands for "empty." Not "eat."

63
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,722
I am hungry, but
that's not possible.

64
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,222
Check it.

65
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,262
Suck my motherfucking balls!

66
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,863
No thanks.

67
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,265
How am I supposed to work with

68
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,033
this inferior goddamn equipment?

69
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,034
Is that what the ladies
are calling it now?

70
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,474
Trust me, my doo-Wally's
working fine.

71
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,443
Hey, look here boy,

72
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,345
if this monster break down
here in the ass of nowhere

73
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,881
you gon' get your lard ass
out there and you gon' push

74
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,317
with the bumper up your ass.

75
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:03,355
Venus, I think it might be time to bring
back the girl into a gorilla-lusion.

76
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,824
You all got a gorilla?

77
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,392
Yeah I got a fucking gorilla,

78
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,227
he's in my pants, i
call him king dong.

79
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,196
Whoa, hey, whoa filly.

80
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,998
- I assume you're joking.
- I am not.

81
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,335
I mean, haven't we got enough
to worry about, without you

82
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,837
framing up a new show?

83
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,872
I mean, besides,

84
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,241
who's gonna hustle
this other shit?

85
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,210
You think I want to be
a fucking mechanic?

86
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,179
Fixing these death traps
the rest of my life?

87
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,115
I mean, I got dreams.

88
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,284
And they do not include yanking
some kid's chewed up arm

89
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,053
out of the gears
of a tilt-a-whirl.

90
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,222
Baby, I got dreams too.
You go for it.

91
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,857
Get the fuck off me.

92
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,025
Hey, baby girl,

93
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,795
I mean, what do you think
about that talent back there?

94
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,864
I mean, the one with the
lop-sided high beams,

95
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,899
I mean, I don't know, she's
either drunk or retarded.

96
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,868
Seriously?

97
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:53,005
She's gonna twitch and itch her
ass all around the mid-way.

98
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,508
Just like all the new babies do.

99
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,778
But that's why I afraid.

100
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,645
A new wave of crap's coming.

101
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,784
So what exactly is the name
of this show of yours?

102
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,952
Okay, dig this.

103
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,157
Professor houldini's mad
gorilla monster show.

104
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,926
Ooh, I'd go see that show.

105
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:17,963
The name's got some grab, but
you're still minus one jungle girl.

106
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,567
I could be a jungle girl, i took a
acting class before I left high school.

107
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,668
Just shut the fuck
up for two seconds.

108
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,973
That's where charly
girl comes in.

109
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:32,978
Charly hardly looks like
a wild woman of Borneo.

110
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,915
Besides, you know the chi is my
main hustle in the girly show.

111
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,985
Okay, we dump the whole Borneo shit, okay?
We work a new angle.

112
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,221
The yokels had burnt out on
that yarn ten years ago.

113
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,024
What's a yokel?

114
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,361
What's the word on this wacky weed this
fine sunny, sunny day, sweet jolly girl?

115
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:54,266
The midwest says sweet jolly,
she got some sweet rasta shit.

116
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:58,237
- Boo-ya-ka, boo-ya-ka.
- My sweet jolly,

117
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,139
pass your brothers a hit.

118
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,175
It isn't mine, baby.

119
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,845
Yeah, there boy.

120
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,414
I gotta keep my
eyes on the road.

121
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,348
This shit's the real deal.

122
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,086
Think you two can handle it?

123
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,855
I try, I try.

124
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,057
First hit's free.

125
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,060
After that you lay
out the green,

126
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,097
before jolly gets too mean.

127
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,498
Shit, warm it up for her.

128
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,302
Levon, I gotta get in there.

129
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,908
- Levon!
- Go away!

130
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,343
Hey, it isn't the levon show.

131
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,611
Go away!

132
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,913
Come on, man.

133
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,415
I just gotta get something
out of the... i gotta get...

134
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,885
God damn man, can't you
see I'm busy back here?

135
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,254
Shit, that's a lot of woman.

136
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,022
Yeah, what you want that's so important
you got to crash my love den?

137
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,957
You're going to give
that man a heart attack.

138
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,327
Tell it again, I don't get it.
Who had the cake?

139
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,365
Christ, bitch, pay
attention this time.

140
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,468
There was a boy, named Harold.

141
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,436
Walked in on his
grandparents having sex.

142
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:08,073
Pretty much like this asshole
don' walked in on me.

143
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,377
Harold said, "grandma!
Whatcha' doing?"

144
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:15,214
Grandma say, "well,
we bakin' a cake.

145
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:20,653
A few days later, Harold say, "grandma, was
you and grandpa baking a cake last night?

146
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,924
Grandma says, "matter of fact, we was.
How'd you know?"

147
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,029
Harold say, "because I just licked
some frosting off the couch."

148
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,597
I still don't get it.

149
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,265
What frosting? Where'd
it come from?

150
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,701
The old man's dick!

151
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,336
The old bastard's jizz
was the frosting.

152
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,277
Hello Congo, how I missed you.

153
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,347
Come on, Roscoe, go get
your ass out of here.

154
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,582
Shit. - I'll get out in a
second. What do you think?

155
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,585
- I think it's cute.
- It isn't cute.

156
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,286

00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,367
- See anybody else?
- Negative.

315
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:27,358
<i>The average human
is quite resilient.</i>

316
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,395
<i>Events that disgust
us one minute</i>

317
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:35,099
<i>quickly become infinitely
acceptable the next.</i>

318
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,570
<i>Sometimes, the weak
ones have the most fight</i>

319
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:42,006
<i>or perhaps they're just the
luckiest, I don't know.</i>

320
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,043
<i>But as we like to
say around here,</i>

321
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:49,679
<i>the dirtier you work,
the luckier you get.</i>

322
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,024
Sounds like it's
coming from this room.

323
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,361
It could be a trap. - This whole
god damn thing is an effing trap.

324
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,231
Okay, okay, I'm going
to slide the door.

325
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,198
Get ready with the pipe.

326
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,834
Go.

327
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,254
Pull it off.

328
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,334
I thought it was charly.

329
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,846
I've... I've never been so
fucking happy I was wrong.

330
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,251
Fuck.

331
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,821
What is this fucking place?

332
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,902
[Taunting noise]

333
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,624
<i>Numero quatro...</i>

334
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,866
Open the fucking gate!

335
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,507
I'm going to put this fucking
knife so far up your fucking ass.

336
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,577
I might like that.

337
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,678
You're a fucking chihuahua.

338
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,816
You think it's funny?

339
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,255
Open the fucking gate!

340
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,690
Fuck you.

341
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,559
I'm coming for you, boy.

342
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,062
Number four always dies first.

343
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,597
We're going to get so friendly,

344
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,200
it's going to kill you.

345
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,301
I'm fucking coming for you.

346
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,772
Open the fucking gate.

347
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,341
Open the fucking gate.

348
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,745
I'm coming for you.

349
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,314
- I'm coming for you.
- I'm fucking coming for you!

350
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,216
I'm fucking coming for you.

351
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,278
Trick or treat you are dead,

352
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:44,449
I will smash your fucking head.

353
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,820
Trick or treat, you are dead,

354
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:53,524
I will smash your fucking head.

355
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:58,396
Trick or treat, you are dead,

356
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:03,633
I will smash your fucking head.

357
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,674
Trick or treat, you are dead,

358
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:14,644
I will smash your fucking head.

359
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,888
Whoa, girl! Cool it with the bat.
I'm on your side.

360
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,027
Come on now, child, let's
get the fuck out of here.

361
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,246
- Fuck!
- God damn bitch!

362
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,948
You somethin' with that slugger.

363
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,983
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

364
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,952
Son of a bitch, i think
I broke his neck.

365
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,787
Shit, where did he get me?

366
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,522
I can't tell, i think
in the shoulder blade.

367
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,290
- Fuck.
- I got to stop the bleeding.

368
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,560
- Here put some pressure here.
- God!

369
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,864
<i>Hola puta! Hola!</i>

370
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,868
Get away from me.

371
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,839
Get away from me! Come on!

372
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,877
Come on.

373
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,680
Come on.

374
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,851
You better run, number five.

375
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:10,621
'Cause I'm gonna go kill number four
and then I'm gonna come back for you

376
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,890
and I'm gonna kill
you nice and slow.

377
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,826
Okay? Run and hide.

378
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:16,994
Go hide.

379
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,895
Fuck.

380
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:26,971
- Damn.
<i>- Ten hours and forty-three minutes.</i>

381
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,806
<i>Anything can still happen.</i>

382
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,078
<i>Hola!</i>

383
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,832
Does that hurt?

384
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,938
Are you okay?

385
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,613
- I thought you were my brother.
- Fuck you, boy.

386
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,948
Fuck you.

387
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,783
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

388
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,719
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

389
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,086
Fuck...

390
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,825
You ready to die?

391
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:23,527
Just fucking do it.

392
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,962
Just fucking do it!

393
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,978
Hold up, do you hear that?

394
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,416
Charly.

395
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,159
Get away!

396
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,445
You've got it,<i> puta.</i>

397
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,796
Let go of me.

398
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,771
My fucking bat.

399
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,785
I got you, I got you brother.

400
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,154
I can't believe
this is happening.

401
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,557
It's all right. I got you.

402
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,991
I'm too young. Too pretty.

403
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,965
- Hey panda.
- Yeah, baby.

404
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,267
Your momma...

405
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,203
She.. No...

406
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,740
She... she said she
was my momma too.

407
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:01,078
That I was her son
from another brother.

408
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,949
- She say...
- You the brother, like no other.

409
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,821
And I... I feel... I feel tired.

410
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:14,223
Tired.

411
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,817
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

412
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,974
I do believe the first kill
came rather quickly this year.

413
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,777
I'm rather disappointed.

414
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:12,182
The first one always does. It's the second
one, the second one has all the drama.

415
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:17,254
Well, I certainly hope we see a better
showing from the remaining remnants.

416
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:21,858
We shall see, we shall see.

417
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:44,214
<i>As we slip into our third
our of non-stop 31 action,</i>

418
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:48,719
<i>come and enjoy and
some exquisite dining.</i>

419
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,124
<i>You may want to try the steak kidney
pie, followed by the apple crumble.</i>

420
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,428
<i>Delicious.</i>

421
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:04,033
<i>For one of you, of course,
this might be your last supper.</i>

422
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,073
Those twisted fuckers.

423
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:11,308
Fuck.

424
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,877
This is impressive.

425
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,881
I hate to admit,
but this layout,

426
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,051
man, it looks better than me
mother's new year's brunch.

427
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,054
Yeah and I assume it's all
laced with rat poisoning.

428
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,290
No, I'm relatively
sure it's safe.

429
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:30,094
Seriously? What could
possibly make you say that?

430
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:33,296
Because we're
playing their game.

431
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,802
Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it.

432
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:43,974
My stomach's so empty,
it's touching me back.

433
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:47,978
Yeah man.

434
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,080
Are you enjoying that?

435
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,347
Yeah man.

436
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,290
I feel it.

437
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:05,061
I feel all of ya'll lookin' at me.
You're judging. Don't.

438
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,497
I isn't made of stone.

439
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:16,373
Look man. What happened to
me man, levon, back there,

440
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:19,877
man, it's fucking horrible.

441
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:23,180
I mean man, he was my best-est
friend in the whole god damn world.

442
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,182
Panda.

443
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:29,419
Your best-est friend's blood
is all over my hands.

444
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,292
And that's why i and
I gon' stay alive.

445
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,529
I don't do it on
an empty stomach.

446
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,331
So you, you and you,

447
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,766
I suggest ya'll do
the same thing.

448
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,171
Fuck it.

449
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,046
I take it they're out
watching us, right?

450
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,515
You bet your sweet skunk
ass they're watching.

451
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,517
And listening.

452
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,586
So keep your breathy
thoughts to yourself.

453
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:06,389
You know, we can do this. We
just have to stay together.

454
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,792
Charly.

455
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,097
Charly.

456
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:15,498
What?

457
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:23,507
What is going on
inside your head?

458
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:26,310
You want to know what's
going on inside my head?

459
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:29,613
I'll fucking tell you what's
going on inside my head.

460
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:33,984
We need better weapons
than this shit.

461
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,818
You're god damn right girly.

462
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,161
Hey, anybody remember that
story last year, Halloween,

463
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,929
that church group
that went missing.

464
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,398
Yeah I remember hearing
something about that,

465
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,001
just recently on the TV they
found the body of the pastor...

466
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,170
- In the dumpster.
- Rotting in dumpster.

467
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,339
Holy shit.

468
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,373
That's gonna be us.

469
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,641
Come on.

470
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,243
No, two second news story.

471
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,978
You know, and we're forgotten.

472
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,012
All right, all right, all right.

473
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:05,148
Not by me.

474
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop eating.

475
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,652
Why, why, what wrong?

476
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,190
Spit it out!

477
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,484
I gotta get the
fuck out of here.

478
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,252
What the fuck?

479
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,521
<i>I sincerely hope you all enjoyed</i>

480
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:48,191
<i>your protein-enriched
nourishments.</i>

481
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:53,096
The first re-assessment of the
standings are as follows:

482
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,333
<i>Number one, 50 to 1 odds.</i>

483
00:48:56,334 --> 00:49:00,103
Number three at 90 to 1.

484
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,340
Number two at 300 to 1.

485
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:09,145
And, last but not least
is number five, 400 to 1.

486
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,452
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, children of all ages,</i>

487
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,722
with exactly nine
hours left to play,

488
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:25,861
<i>I give you, psycho-head and his brother,
the maniacally mental schizo-head.</i>

489
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,532
There's two of 'em.

490
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,233
Don't scatter.

491
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,303
God damn!

492
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,306
We isn't got a fucking thing to
worry about this year, brother.

493
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:41,311
Look at these sorry sacks
of wasted meat shit.

494
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,879
Do we have your attention
now, mother fuckers?

495
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,117
You smell that?

496
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:49,619
Well I think they're already
pissing in their pants.

497
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,723
Yeah. Now you think
you got one over

498
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:55,692
because you took out that little
shot glass bitch sick-head,

499
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,028
well he isn't worth a shit.

500
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:00,564
The only thing he's good for is
shooting out of a fucking Cannon.

501
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,632
And I don't see a fucking Cannon,
do you see a fucking Cannon?

502
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,401
No Cannon.

503
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,770
So that means that you
killed half a man.

504
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,106
And it took five of you

505
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:11,775
to kill one itty
bitty little baby.

506
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,111
Shit.

507
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,680
Hello ladies.

508
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,649
I am all man and i
am coming for you.

509
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,784
We're gonna fuck all your holes.

510
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:27,456
Count yourselves lucky, you
got fucked by the best!

511
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,668
<i>Eight hours and twelve minutes,</i>

512
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:42,271
<i>the fun is just beginning.</i>

513
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,553
I don't hear them anymore.

514
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,722
- Me neither.
- Listen.

515
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,724
I think we should find a room.

516
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,061
Barricade ourselves in.
Wait it out.

517
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,662
I second the barricade idea.

518
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,531
I'm sick of this
hide-and-seek horse shit.

519
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,167
Got to use your head.

520
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,636
They don't want for us to be sitting
around all night on our back side.

521
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:15,272
Okay, okay, hold on. Charly, we haven't
heard you in the last half an hour,

522
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,640
what do you say? Your
vote counts like mine.

523
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,680
I say we hunt these freaks down
and slit their fucking throats.

524
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,416
All right.

525
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,436
<i>Gonna fuck your pussy hole.</i>

526
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,806
<i>Gonna fuck that tiny
little brown hole.</i>

527
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,575
<i>And we're gonna fuck
your eye hole too!</i>

528
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:54,644
<i>A cock in each
motherfuckin' socket.</i>

529
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,347
<i>We're gonna fuck
your mouth hole.</i>

530
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,516
<i>We're gonna fuck
your pussy hole.</i>

531
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,519
<i>We're gonna fuck that
tiny little brown hole.</i>

532
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,421
<i>And we're gonna fuck
your eye hole too.</i>

533
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,390
What's that sound?

534
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,163
Do you hear it?

535
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,597
It's coming from the fuck doll.

536
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,537
Shh. Shh.

537
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,981
That's no fucking doll.

538
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,429
Jesus Christ, god.

539
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,266
What the fuck? Panda! Panda!

540
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,667
Don't flip out on me now, man.
Come on.

541
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,840
Help me, please.

542
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,776
I need to go home, everyone
is waiting for me.

543
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,745
Sweet Jesus.

544
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,180
Help me untie her.

545
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,248
No, no, no, no.

546
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,516
What's your name, honey?

547
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,785
Georgina Victor.

548
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,421
- Georgina.
- But my husband calls me little Georgie.

549
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,658
Hold the fuck up,
hold the fuck up,

550
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,360
- put me the fuck down.
- Panda, what do you think?

551
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,329
- Put me the fuck down.
- We don't take the chance on it.

552
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,797
- On letting her run loose.
- She isn't one of them.

553
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,704
Look at her. Look at her.

554
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,307
She might be somebody's
daughter for all I know.

555
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,642
This is gettin' crazy
around here...

556
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,477
Shut the fuck up.

557
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,313
Panda, shut the fuck up.

558
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:38,682
He's right, this is
not a good idea.

559
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:43,453
Please, please, i
know a way out.

560
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,555
- I've heard them talking.
- I believe you.

561
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,489
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

562
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,260
Shit, they fucking found us.

563
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:51,661
We got to secure the door.

564
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,630
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

565
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,966
She sounded the alarm. She
sounded the fucking alarm.

566
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,235
You psycho fucking bitch.

567
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,271
Yeah, I know you. Tell the house mole.
I know you.

568
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,439
Shut the fuck up, Roscoe.

569
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,707
You don't listen to me.

570
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,707
You do not listen to me.

571
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,912
Look at her. Look at her.

572
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,280
Fucking asshole.

573
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,982
You are falling for her.

574
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:15,785
We've got to get something
to block off the door.

575
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,621
How about one of these pipes?

576
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:19,456
Look at me, look at me.

577
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:20,757
Are you fucking going
to help me or not?

578
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,024
Look at me.

579
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,764
Fuck.

580
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,502
Fuck!

581
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,671
Bless you. Bless you.

582
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,811
I can't get the wires.

583
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,513
It's in her fucking skin.

584
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,448
Rip it out.

585
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,050
Think it'll hold?

586
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,217
No.

587
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,187
Get me out of here!

588
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,991
Fuck!

589
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,767
I knew it. I knew it.

590
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,468
You fucking bitch.

591
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,537
It's a fucking cage.

592
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,739
God damn it! It's
a fucking cage.

593
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,744
[Singing maniacally

594
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,848
check the back.

595
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,850
God damn it. I knew it.

596
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,786
I knew it. God damn it.
Nobody listens to me.

597
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,268
Hi there, momma! You miss me?

598
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,882
Woo!

599
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,455
Look what the fucking
cat drug in.

600
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,357
Two blind mice.

601
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,726
See how they're dumb.

602
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,861
Even the fucking mice know how to
get out of the maze, motherfuckers.

603
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,938
Looks like I need
a new fuck bag.

604
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:19,409
And after I get done with
pork chop, you're after.

605
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,444
You gotta go through
me before her..

606
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,680
You're gonna be my fuck bag.
Come on, bring it.

607
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,882
All that chivalry is
worthless, motherfucker.

608
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,950
Like tits on a boar hog.

609
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,685
Come on, bitch!

610
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:31,086
Meet Mr. fucking dick
head, sideburns.

611
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,228
Panda!

612
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,369
You fucking bitch.

613
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,107
You do like to make it
happen, don't you, bitch?

614
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,352
No, I'll never fucking die!

615
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,089
I don't want to die.

616
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,594
I don't want to be here,
they make me be here.

617
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,630
We're all pawns in
this stupid game.

618
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,199
We don't want to...

619
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,669
You and me, we're the same.

620
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,238
We're the same, brother.

621
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,743
Okay, brother.

622
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,146
That thing's gonna
come in handy.

623
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,825
All right Roscoe, I
got you, i got you.

624
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,961
Let's get out of here before that
damn thing slams shut again.

625
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:29,165
Charly, pick up that
other chainsaw.

626
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,667
Fucking chain snapped.

627
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:31,868
Leave it!

628
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,903
Fuck.

629
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,339
Seven hours and three minutes.

630
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,744
I believe it's time to
recalculate the odds.

631
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,413
Prepare to open your purses.

632
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:54,089
Shit.

633
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,996
How fucked am I?

634
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,031
I don't know, man.
It looks pretty bad.

635
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,901
Yeah, it feels pretty bad.

636
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:08,638
You've got to get this tight
enough to keep it shut.

637
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,108
What's that thing you say to the kids
coming out of the spook house in tears?

638
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,044
- Why?
- Just tell me.

639
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:20,383
Crying is for pussies, so go
grow a pair, you big baby.

640
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:23,118
Get ready to grow a
pair, you big baby.

641
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,189
God.

642
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,866
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

643
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,036
<i>Number one, odds 40 to 1.</i>

644
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,705
<i>Number two, odds 300 to 1.</i>

645
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:46,643
Number three, 1 million to 1.

646
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,946
Fuck.

647
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:54,083
<i>5, odds, 300 to one.</i>

648
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:58,386
Sex and death are on their way.

649
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,940
What the fuck is going on.

650
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,745
You see anything?

651
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:59,382
All I see is a bunch of nothing.

652
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,318
It seems crazy.

653
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,754
Waiting here to be attacked.

654
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,824
Running around with
our heads cut off.

655
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,292
Only gets us a chance to
get our heads cut off.

656
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,364
Get the others.

657
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,107
Come with me. Just go with them.

658
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,175
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey.

659
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,443
- Come on. What are you talking about?
- Stay here, stay here.

660
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,377
Be right back.

661
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,187
Who would wear a green
tutu but that guy?

662
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,924
All right my best play
is I circle around

663
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,993
go cut them from the back side.

664
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,328
Now once I'm in place,

665
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,497
ya'll create a distraction.

666
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:50,565
Only gon' get one shot. So
you got to make it proper.

667
01:02:55,071 --> 01:03:00,042
Death has come to
sing its quiet song.

668
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:04,180
How they hide, for
it won't be long.

669
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:09,250
Death strikes once,
and then it's gone!

670
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,423
Where are you little
fucking cunts?

671
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,491
I want to see you.

672
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,070
Fuck if I'm going to
fucking stay here.

673
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,948
Come on!

674
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,883
We're right here.

675
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,650
Come on and come and get it.

676
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:48,023
Panda, they hear you.
Behind you.

677
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,920
How nice, the women are
here to save the day.

678
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,021
Come on.

679
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,389
Come ladies, come here.

680
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,391
- Panda, panda.
- Come, come on.

681
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,492
I want to fuck you.

682
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,134
I'm so scared.

683
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,347
Hi.

684
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:59,694
Great white hunter, what
am I going to do with you?

685
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,566
Would you like a
lick of my lolly?

686
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,940
I remember you.

687
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,508
I'm so flattered
you remember me.

688
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,413
Is it huntin' time now?

689
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,220
Or how about now?

690
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:36,198
Don't worry, popeye, it's
always someone's fault.

691
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,635
Come here, bitch.
Come and get me.

692
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:44,405
Well I am kind of high from
eating all my spinach.

693
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:50,345
I guess maybe I should really
put you out of your misery.

694
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,552
Fuck!

695
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:03,291
[Both struggling bitch!

696
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,729
Fuck you.

697
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,897
Motherfucker, come on.

698
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:26,809
I can feel your fear.

699
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,413
It's like a strange smell.

700
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:31,514
Hey!

701
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,514
- Scat!
- Hey

702
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:45,260
you want her? Then back off, or
I'll slit her fucking throat.

703
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,265
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

704
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,798
Don't hurt her.

705
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,835
Don't, don't that.

706
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:05,214
You can kill me...

707
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:07,348
Venus!

708
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,387
Baby, no!

709
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,957
No!

710
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,798
Baby! No!

711
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,500
What are you waiting for?

712
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,302
We can't.

713
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:28,569
Do it. Do it.

714
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,541
No! No!

715
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,045
What do you want to
do with her, charly?

716
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,601
What is the next step?

717
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:03,839
We must calculate the
next step very carefully.

718
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,442
Death-head was our safety net.

719
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:09,678
But since he has expired...

720
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,815
Could I suggest bash-head?

721
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,851
He can't be trusted to close
the deal properly, no.

722
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,353
Fuck you, bitch.

723
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,421
Maybe rage-head.

724
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:20,890
Too irrational.

725
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,392
Fuck.

726
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:29,465
I believe there is only one logical
and still compelling choice.

727
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,934
Yeah, woo!

728
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:34,170
Doom-head.

729
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,472
Fuck, fuck. Bitch.

730
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:38,741
Are we in agreement
on that decision?

731
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:40,609
Agreed.

732
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,711
Fucking yeah.

733
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,480
It is doom-head.

734
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:47,183
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,585
Who's going to make the call?

736
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,720
Yeah, yeah.

737
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,923
Yeah, yeah.

738
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:58,427
- Fuck.
- Don't answer that. Don't answer it.

739
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,229
It can wait, don't answer it.

740
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,830
Fuck, don't stop now.

741
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,701
This is business.

742
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,840
Yeah?

743
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:17,379
Thing is, I really wasn't
planning on working this year.

744
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:24,253
Right now, I got a pretty decent piece of pussy
with a big 'ol ass spread right in front of me.

745
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:29,491
Double last year's fee.

746
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:33,429
Done. I'll be there
in 90 minutes.

747
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,564
What's that?

748
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,966
Fuck off.

749
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:40,101
Who was it baby?

750
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,241
That, believe it or not,

751
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:50,379
was Mr.
None-of-your-fucking-business.

752
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,249
Yeah well what the fuck
am i supposed to do?

753
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:58,320
Well, you can stick your
fingers in your dripping twat

754
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:02,591
and finish yourself off
or get the fuck out.

755
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,693
Frankly my dear, i
don't give a damn.

756
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,562
You know, you're pretty
full of yourself,

757
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:10,699
nobody messes with Mr.
Big shot, well fuck you.

758
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:15,371
Bitch, you run a perfect
game day after day,

759
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:18,641
isn't luck hun, skill.

760
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:20,776
Can I at least take a
shower before I go?

761
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,945
Negative.

762
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,581
Take that sticking ass
and hit the bricks.

763
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,682
Do you hear that?

764
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,222
God I love that song.

765
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,831
Shit. I wish i was
in California.

766
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,700
What am I working with?

767
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,470
Four hours and
thirty-seven minutes.

768
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,904
I can kill your whole family
in that amount of time.

769
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,217
<i>I'm not crazy, I'm in control.</i>

770
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,886
<i>I'm not crazy, I'm in control.</i>

771
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:20,155
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

772
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,691
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

773
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:25,194
I'm not crazy, I'm in control.

774
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:27,128
I'm not crazy, fuck!

775
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,934
Fuck!

776
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,329
Gentlemen.

777
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:09,270
Take the rest of the night off.
I'll handle it from here.

778
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,876
Murder school, well
it's now in session.

779
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,931
Hey, bitch.

780
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:39,167
Now did you really think cutting my
head off was going to keep me down?

781
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:44,071
I got that motherfucker sewn back
on pronto and I am feeling groovy.

782
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:49,244
You see, we isn't human around here.
No, no, no.

783
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,880
Ain't you learned shit yet?

784
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:56,018
Hey brother, looky over here.

785
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:58,319
You want to see
something mad funny?

786
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,724
Hey there number five.

787
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,160
Welcome to the party.

788
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,696
Here's your first question.

789
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:11,867
What's sicker than fucking
a pregnant bitch?

790
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,002
- Gee.
- I don't know.

791
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:18,874
What is sicker than
fucking a pregnant bitch?

792
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,176
Getting a blowjob from the baby.

793
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:28,050
- Do another one, man.
- All right, all right.

794
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:30,786
Next one, number five.

795
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:36,892
What is the difference between
an onion and a whore?

796
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:40,095
Shucks, I don't know.

797
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:43,899
Though I should, 'cause I am a whore.
What is it?

798
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,068
W-w-w-wait, I know this one.

799
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,336
Let me do it, let me do it.

800
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:49,103
All right brother, you go ahead.

801
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:55,243
The difference between
an onion and a whore is

802
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:58,078
I cry when I cut onions!

803
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,849
It's okay, it's okay.

804
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,553
It's okay, shh.

805
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,523
It's okay.

806
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,867
It's all right.

807
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,835
Roscoe.

808
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:32,047
I had the worst nightmare.

809
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:39,054
How can a nightmare be any
worse than this reality?

810
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:40,287
It can't.

811
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,029
How long was I asleep?

812
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:52,734
I don't know. At this
point I don't know...

813
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,535
If it's a minute or an hour.

814
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,173
Where's charly?

815
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,008
Hey did...

816
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,077
Where's charly?

817
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,112
She... she went down the hall
to see what she could find.

818
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:06,715
You let her go out on her own?

819
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,415
Like I was going to stop her?

820
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:13,221
You idiot. An idiot.

821
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,258
She, hey, she specifically
said for you to stay here.

822
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:18,727
Well, that's not
going to happen.

823
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,696
Come on, Venus.

824
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,663
Give me a fucking break.

825
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:40,949
Excuse me for asking father, but what exactly
is the protocol if we have a survivor?

826
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,285
Doom-head has never failed us.

827
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:46,354
He will deliver, as expected.

828
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:50,691
I mean no disrespect, but
that was not the question.

829
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,201
I suggest you make sure your
final wagers are in order.

830
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:01,136
Lovely thank you,
darling, thank you.

831
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:04,172
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

832
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:07,409
Right, my wager.

833
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,610
Five million.

834
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,484
I respectfully decline.
I am out.

835
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:19,954
Of course you are. Playing with the
big boys isn't everyone's cup of tea.

836
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,993
I will take that bet.

837
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,233
And double it.

838
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:42,076
All right, now we have ourselves a game.
So let us continue.

839
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,472
You smell that?

840
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:49,978
Go on, smell it.

841
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:54,282
I didn't yank my crusty old dong
out of some whore's asshole

842
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:57,285
for a quickie wham,
bam, thank you ma'am,

843
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:02,222
I came to get down
and dirty, yeah.

844
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,263
Please...

845
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,031
Let them live.

846
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,967
What is it about
me that gives you

847
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:14,468
some impression that
i would spare them?

848
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:21,208
'Cause if that's the case then i really got
to work on my person to person demeanor.

849
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:29,885
Unfortunately, those other fools and idiots
gave you the most worthless feeling.

850
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,188
And that feeling is hope.

851
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:39,361
The unicorn alive shitting the magic
rainbow, it's but an illusion.

852
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:46,400
Life is nothing but the stinking filthy
boneyard of dead rotting tramps?

853
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,601
Did you see Venus?

854
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:21,236
What are you talking about,
man, i left her here with you.

855
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:23,672
Fuck me.

856
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:26,274
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

857
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:32,346
<i>Three hours and four
minutes, how time flies.</i>

858
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:31,139
Victorious warriors win
first then go to war.

859
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:36,343
While defeated warriors, they go
to war first then seek to win.

860
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:38,979
Which are you?

861
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,252
I'm a gentle man of war.

862
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:48,956
So I'll give you a moment of peace and
tranquility with your fallen comrade.

863
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,696
By the way,

864
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,965
the doors to the outside world
are now officially open.

865
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:02,369
Feel free to wander the grounds.

866
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,628
Come on, let's go.

867
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,238
It's a fucking dead end.
A goddamn dead end.

868
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,439
Damn.

869
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,243
What's this?

870
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:46,081
This, this, this.
This is fucking it.

871
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:48,482
Help me, help me. This is it.

872
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,719
- Come on.
- It's rising.

873
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,456
Come on. Help me.

874
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,368
What do you think?

875
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:08,570
It's your best chance.

876
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:10,371
You mean our best chance.

877
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:13,108
No, I don't, i can't
get down there.

878
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,543
After everything this is
where you bail on me?

879
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,812
No, this shit isn't over.

880
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,448
I can't get down there. I can't.

881
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,882
You can.

882
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,987
Fuck, he's coming. Get in there.

883
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,859
I'll hold him off
as long as I can.

884
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,860
Wait, I'm not leaving.

885
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:33,328
Fucking go.

886
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,429
I'm not leaving without you.

887
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:35,730
Get the fuck down there.

888
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:36,898
Shut the fuck up.

889
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:38,299
Get the fuck in there.

890
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,801
Stupid bitch get in there.

891
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,169
Shut the fuck up and
get down there.

892
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,769
Get the fuck in there.

893
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,078
At least I get to die
in the fresh air.

894
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,483
Hey fuck head!

895
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,384
Get over here!

896
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,855
Get the fuck over
here, fuck head!

897
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,494
You trying to fight
me or fuck me?

898
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,069
Fuck.

899
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,910
Number five...

900
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,077
Boo.

901
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:30,223
In moments of great
accomplishment such as this,

902
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:35,530
I feel the need to celebrate.

903
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:42,003
I found that the best of times happens
exactly at the point we lose track of them.

904
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:47,140
We must train ourselves to extend
the moment and learn to live.

905
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:07,595
Smoke in times of rest is a great
companion to the solitary soldier.

906
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:11,031
You know who said that?

907
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,203
Do you know said that?

908
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,757
Do you really think
i give a fuck?

909
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:47,902
It was everyone's favorite
revolutionary marxist, che Guevara.

910
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:53,608
Except, I think
he smoked a pipe.

911
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:57,777
I always thought I'd appear
rather pretentious with a pipe.

912
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:04,084
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

913
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,123
Look.

914
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:14,095
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

915
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:17,397
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

916
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,537
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

917
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:26,473
Look in to the eyes
of a true champion.

918
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,722
Aww, shh...

919
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,625
That's a good girl.

920
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:47,895
It's all okay.

921
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:53,134
Shh.

922
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:55,770
Catch your breath.

923
01:32:55,771 --> 01:33:00,241
Catch your breath, it's okay.

924
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:02,777
It's okay.

925
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:05,012
There you go.

926
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:08,281
Relax, little girl.

927
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,288
Well, well, well,

928
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:17,357
shall we do this white
chapel style, then?

929
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:25,199
Bloody red tears,
my dear Mary Kelly.

930
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,370
I have to say I do respect you.

931
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:34,474
But, um, it's time to die.

932
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:41,616
<i>Weapons down. Weapons down.</i>

933
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:43,918
Motherfucker!

934
01:33:43,919 --> 01:33:48,956
<i>31 has come to an end.</i>

935
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:52,592
You lucky fucking
dirty little cunt.

936
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:28,195
<i>It seems the unthinkable
has happened.</i>

937
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:30,665
<i>We have a winner.</i>

938
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:35,169
<i>What exactly will
you do with her?</i>

939
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,140
<i>I'm going to have to get
back to you on that one.</i>

940
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:43,543
<i>Thank you for another
exciting year of 31.</i>
