1
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,630
It's Officer Eddy.

2
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,468
I'd like you
to come into the station.

3
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,037
Oh, is it about the house,
'cause I could...

4
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:08,039
Dwight, sweetheart,
I'll explain.

5
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,605
Okay?
Just come with me.

6
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,441
I apologize for the mystery.

7
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,876
I don't mean to scare you.

8
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,778
You're not in any trouble.

9
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,617
Everything's fine.
You'll be fine.

10
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,487
But, honey, someone brought
this by our stoop,

11
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,554
and I just thought
you should be somewhere safe

12
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:58,925
when you found out...

13
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,562
With somebody.

14
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,500
He's going to be released...

15
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,036
...and I don't know
how much you...

16
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,737
They are missed.

17
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:16,039
It's an awful thing
he did to them.

18
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,944
I'm just gonna hold you here
for a little while...

19
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,230
Do you sell stamps?

20
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,009
I just want this
party over with.

21
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,045
Wade doesn't know.

22
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:50,413
Yeah, if you stop
talking out of your ass.

23
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,553
You putting him on your books?

No, she talks too much.

Yeah, I'm not used to it.

31
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,678
She talks shit
or she talks too much?

32
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:30,782
- What? Me too, man?
- Yeah.

33
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:35,318
Maybe.
Just let me piss.

34
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,422
I haven't done it alone
in ten years.

35
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,629
Hey, man.
You all right?

36
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,234
Yeah.
I got some shit lined up.

37

No, man.
I don't piss on my hands.

39
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,440
Hey, you want order
another beer?

40
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,843
Yeah.
I'll order some shit.

41
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,645
I hear that.

42
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:13,825

in there? Beating off?

00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,726
Yeah, we should've had
a hooker waiting.

46
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,928
Let's go.
The party's for you.

47
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,641
Ow!

48
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,497
Let's go, brother.

49
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,968
Oh, fuck.

00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,920

60
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,778
Yeah.

61
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,351
Wade hurt my parents.

62
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,493
I don't think he did.

63
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,687
<i>Let's look
at the windy conditions.</i>

64
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,722
<i>Of course, with the
thunderstorms themselves,</i>

65
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:16,593
<i>the winds could be quite strong
and areas of fog are possible.</i>

66
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,662
<i>If you've been to the gas pump
in the last couple weeks,</i>

67
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,530
<i>you've probably felt
the stinging</i>

68
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,665
<i>of some of the fastest climbing
gas prices in years.</i>

69
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,468
<i>So where...</i>

70
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,836
<i>Small dogs and cats</i>

71
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:28,104
<i>should be kept in an enclosure</i>

72
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,206
<i>if left unattended, as coyotes,</i>

73
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,545
<i>oh, are able to jump...</i>

74
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:06,844
<i>Two, three, four, five.</i>

75
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:07,678
<i>One more time.</i>

76
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,583
One, two, three,

77
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,817
four, five.

78
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,653
- Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:18,121
Got a late start.

80
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,123
Would you mind moving
the sprinklers into the bushes

81
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,691
- in, like, 20 minutes?
- Sure, yeah.

82
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,627
And then just turn it off in 15.

83
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:27,230
The girls did Shrinky Dinks last night.
Could you put them in the oven?

84
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,600
Ten minutes, 350, something like
that. It's on the box.

85
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,567
Thank you.
Bye, girls.

86
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:32,638
- Thank you.
- Bye.

87
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,799
Dwight?

88
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,702
Hey, Sam.

89
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,178
You have a good day.

90
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,718
Thank you so much.

91
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,885
Hi.

92
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,755
I wish I had more time.

93
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,961
Got an asset inventory
that can't push.

94
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,296
Do you need money?

95
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,097
No.

96
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,900
Did you get my letter?

97
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,069
I sent it after
I crossed the bridge.

98
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,874
- It was a postcard.
- No. When?

99
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,008
A couple days ago.

100
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,750
Well, postcards take more time.

101
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,219
Dwight, I'm not following.

102
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,759
I sent it on my way
to Deerfield.

103
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,996
I know he's out,
if that's why you're here.

104
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:10,267
The DOC sends a notification
and a restraining order.

105
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,038
Let's not...

106
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:15,243
I'm sorry I left.

107
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,815
I'm sorry, too.

108
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,984
With this busted sandwich.

109
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,689
I have had worse.

110
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,190
You need to put the registration

111
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,358
for the Bonneville in your name
if you still have it.

112
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,993
I have an extra set of keys
if you want them.

113
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,662
It's gone.

114
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,164
As far as the estate goes,
you're still owed $2,800.

115
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,066
There's still a box
of your things...

116
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,335
You can keep it all.

117
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:48,270
I don't want it, Dwight.

118
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:50,374
No. That's fine.

119
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,079
I'm not used to talking
this much.

120
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,852
That's what people do.

121
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,859
I know.

122
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,326
How's Delaware?

123
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,199
You knew?

124
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,299
Not exactly where.

125
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,935
We still try to go
every few years

126
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,971
to keep the tradition.

127
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:24,042
Mostly for the kids.

128
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,277
You know I have two kids now?

129
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,313
I know.

130
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:33,150
I mean, I...

131
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,188
I saw you
a couple of summers ago.

132
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,922
You were on the boardwalk.

133
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,892
You didn't say anything?

134
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,296
I...

135
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,034
I looked a mess.

136
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:53,403
So why now?

137
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,305
Wade Cleland gets released.

138
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,807
Well...

139
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:01,748
I thought there'd be something
on the news, but...

140
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,288
There's nothing.

141
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:14,758
I killed him.

142
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,227
Wade Cleland, I killed him.

143
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,430
What?

144
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,500
Bullshit.

145
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,335
When?

146
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,470
I think yesterday.

147
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,204
Oh, God, Dwight.

148
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,839
I thought he'd kill me first.

149
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,690
I'm glad he didn't.

150
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,412
And I'm glad he's dead
and I hope he suffered.

151
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:39,216
Excuse me.
You got ketchup on yours?

152
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,790
I don't.

153
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,258
Sorry.

154
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,336
Thanks.

155
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,005
Clelands still live up
on East Hundred.

156
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,074
The older one,
he owns limousines.

157
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,442
- Yeah.
- How great is that?

158
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,478
Operates out of Charlottesville.

159
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,248
Every time I see one pass
through town

160
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,848
or on the way to the airport...

161
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,317
Fucking June, fucking prom...

162
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:19,288
- You don't own the...
- Where are your children?

163
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,124
Home with the sitter.

164
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,993
Let's get back in your car.

165
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:26,132
- What?
- They never called the police.

166
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,100
Okay, it's ringing.

167
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,503
She's not picking up.
She's not picking up.

168
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:35,079
She's not picking up.

169
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,213
No, no, no.

170
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,147
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

171
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:46,383
Wait.

172
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,921
- Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

173
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,243
I'll turn myself in
here, if that's what you want,

174
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:17,314
but I can't do it until I know

175
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,518
that you're safe,
that the kids are safe, so...

176
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,553
The Clelands
need to be arrested.

177
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,422
All of them?

178
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,123
For what?

179
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,924
Look, I...

180
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,193
Just go.

181
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,262
You can call the police
from Pittsburgh

182
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:36,605
if that's what you want.
Just so long as you're not here.

183
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,606
It's my house, Dwight.

184
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,408
They know that.

185
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:49,917
The car is registered here,
and it's not worth...

186
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,353
Is there a gun in the house?

187
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,265
Course not.

188
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:20,679
Duck. My duck.
Your duck.

I only told work, nobody else.

192
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:46,937
I'd forgive you
if you were crazy,

193
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,605
but you're not.

194
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:51,608
You're weak.

195
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,655
I got him.

196
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,685
Hey. Were you coming for me
or for her?

197
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,494
Were you coming
for me or for her?

198
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,208

I had an accident on my leg.

214
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:05,060
Hey, is somebody out there?

215
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,562
Hey!
I'm in the trunk!

216
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:08,897
Let me out!

217
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:10,566
Is that you?

218
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,001
Help!

219
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,337
Let me out!

220
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,107
I'm dying!

221
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,909
Let me out!

222
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:24,212
Let me out, you son of a bitch.

223
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:25,586
Help!

224
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,096
Let me out of here!

225
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:50,566
Not until I have a gun.

226
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,273
Shit, I can get you a gun.

227
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,140
Hey!

228
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,408
Hey!

229
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,676
I got to get out of here!

230
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:05,548
I'm thirsty!
My leg's broken!

231
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,317
- Mrs. Gaffney, hi.
- Yes?

232
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:12,154
I was looking for Ben.
Is he still in town?

233
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,055
No, he moved a while ago.

234
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:18,426
It's Dwight, from Orange High.

235
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:19,662
I just...

236
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,497
Oh.

237
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,299
I'm so sorry, I...

238
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,268
Mr. Gaffney's upstairs
asleep and...

239
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:30,344
I didn't recognize you, Dwight.

240
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,680
Okay, this is where he works.

241
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,415
This is where he lives.

242
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,683
He moved when he got back
from Japan.

243
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,618
He was deployed.

244
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,254
You might need a map,

245
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,488
'cause it's out of the way
off of...

246
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,293
I have a map, thank you.

247
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:51,493
So are you in a rush?

248
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,629
Sort of.
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,201
Otherwise I'd offer you
some tea.

250
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,602
I'd love some tea.

251
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,373
Good.

252
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,241
Ben works late, anyway.

253
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,146
They play
God-awful music there.

254
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:38,040
Excuse me.

255
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,475
I was looking for
a band member...

256
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,776
What?

257
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,444
I was looking for a band
member named Ben.

258
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:45,046
Ben Gaffney.

259
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,415
And I think he was supposed...

260
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,116
- You mean Benny?
- Yes.

261
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:49,685
Yeah, he's here.

262
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,020
He works the bar.
He's not in the band.

263
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:54,089
That's fine.

264
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,559
Do you know what time
he goes home?

265
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,128
Ben.

266
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:33,264
Hey, Ben.

267
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:36,199
Ben.

268
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:38,500
Ben!

269
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:39,734
It's Dwight...

270
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:41,438
Evans.

271
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:44,439
Oh.

272
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,375
Wow, man.

273
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,377
You look square.

274
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:51,513
I've been away.

275
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,114
Yeah, man.

276
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,584
No shit.

277
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,291
Just peaced the fuck out, huh?

278
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,766
Same year El Duce
got hit by a train.

279
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:13,535
Yo, put the first 200 miles
on this thing

280
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:16,772
stapling up
your missing posters.

281
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,875
I never thought of that.

282
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,676
So are we getting beers or...

283
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:26,647
Look, I need to warn you
that I'm here,

284
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:30,185
that I came to you
because I need a favor,

285
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:31,159
and it's a big one.

286
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,338
Sure.
What do you need?

287
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,140
You remember James Henry's
brother's party

288
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,542
with the stripper at his shop?

289
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,845
Haven't really thought back
that far in a while.

290
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,846
Where is it?

291
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,484
I got this Polaroid of you
and me with the stripper.

292
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:04,852
It's hilarious.

293
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,455
We look terrified.

294
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,195
Ben, I need to hurry.

295
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,400
Right.

296
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,535
You hunt?

297
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,502
No.

298
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:23,806
Target shooting mostly.

299
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,308
Mountain bike...

300
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,243
What do you need this for?

301
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:29,845
- I'd rather not...
- Oh, no, no.

302
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,547
Hey, no, man.
The less I know, the better.

303
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:33,881
What do you need out of the gun?

304
00:52:33,882 --> 00:52:35,917
At range?
At close quarters?

305
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,585
Close up or far away?

306
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,589
Oh, close up, probably.
I don't know.

307
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,927
- Hopefully not at all.
- Roger that.

308
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,628
All right.

309
00:52:46,628 --> 00:52:48,430
Let's see what we got.

310
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,899
Enfield Mark III, Circuit Judge,

311
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,767
a Mosin,

312
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:55,770
my current personal favorite.

313
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:58,272
Bolt Action.
It's heavy.

314
00:52:58,273 --> 00:52:59,543
Plus surplus ammo's cheap.

315
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:03,377
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.

316
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:06,314
All right.
Picked this up this year.

317
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:09,283
Shoots its own
9-millimeter cartridge.

318
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:11,520
But you got to load it
slide back with a stripper clip.

319
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,388
Nothing that's special to you.

320
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:15,393
Just whatever's
the least expensive.

321
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:20,328
All right.
Here.

322
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:24,700
Mini-14.
Gun show, no papers.

323
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,538
It's carbine.
That just means it's short.

324
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,339
Semi-auto.

325
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,241
It fires every time
you pull the trigger.

326
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,442
20 rounds, very reliable.

327
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:37,412
And I got extra ammo.

328
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:39,648
You recognize it?

329
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:44,685
<i>It's the A-Team gun, man,
from the show.</i>

330
00:53:44,686 --> 00:53:46,657
Except theirs were stainless.

331
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:50,491
What's up with that?

332
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,467
It's an arrow wound.

333
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,667
So...

334
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:02,571
You're, like, in this.

335
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,909
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

336
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:09,710
'Cause I was just blowing smoke
up your ass, bro.

337
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:11,513
Thought about calling the cops.

338
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,681
Please don't.

339
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:16,618
Not yet.

340
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,287
I don't have a speech.

341
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,288
I just need you
to trust me, please.

342
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:22,056
I do trust you, bro.

343
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:25,459
But I can't send you off
like this.

344
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,828
I could train you.

345
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:28,296
CQB, man.

346
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,431
Surprise, speed,
violence of action.

347
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:32,968
I just need...

348
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,340
I just need somewhere quiet
right now.

349
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,908
I got 16 acres.

350
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:43,912
Take the road we came in on
till it ends.

351
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,550
You'll see the targets.

352
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,471
You ever killed anyone?

353
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:54,065
Two on purpose.

354
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,800
Can I get a thing of water?

355
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,077
Stay in the trunk.

356
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,078
That's easy.

357
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,613
My leg's broke.

358
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,013
Were you coming for me
or for her?

359
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:55,417
- Who?
- You came to my sister's house.

360
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,120
Were you coming for me
or for her?

361
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,156
Look, man.
You.

362
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,758
Why didn't you just
call the police,

363
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,493
send me to jail?

364
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,344
Same as you.

365
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,706
Just keeping it in-house.

366
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,474
What if I surrender?

367
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,087
I accept.

368
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,190
To the police.

369
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,826
You don't get to do what you
did and just lock yourself up.

370
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:42,964
Shit, I'd give you props
if he wasn't my brother,

371
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,598
or if he deserved it.

372
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,100
Which one are you again?

373
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:48,035
Teddy.

374
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:50,105
Who's the boy in the limousine?

375
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,508
He's just a boy.
Not a concern.

376
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:54,942
He said something about Wade.

377
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,912
He said he didn't think
he'd hurt anyone.

378
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,113
Couple dead niggers
might disagree.

379
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:01,786
He just meant Wade
didn't kill your parents.

380
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:05,787
That's not true.

381
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:09,024
Well, that settles it, then.

382
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,692
That's how this works, man.

383
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,460
The one with the gun
gets to tell the truth.

384
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:14,867
Problem is, you don't know shit.

385
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,100
Tell me.

386
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:21,136
I should've done the time.

387
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,104
Are you saying you killed them?

388
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:24,842
Nope.

389
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,009
What are you trying to do?
What are you trying to do, man?

390
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,011
Goddamn!

391
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,814
Fish in a barrel!

392
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,582
Stop it!

393
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,884
Whatever you're trying
to say, say it.

394
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:39,721
I didn't do it.

395
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:43,625
Wade didn't do it.

396
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,761
Our father, Big Wade,
shot your dad.

397
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:52,000
You don't fuck with a
man's wife, his family.

398
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:56,037
Whatever my dad did,
he did with your mom.

399
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:58,073
Together... it was a mistake.

400
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,274
Well, shit's not a mistake.

401
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,642
Both of my parents are dead.

402
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:04,980
Your mother being in the car, that
was a fuck-up. I'll give you that.

403
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,549
If what you're saying
about Wade is true, then...

404
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,118
Big Wade had cancer.

405
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,654
Couldn't let him die in prison.

406
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:16,825
I'd have done the time,
but I had two strikes.

407
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,268
Little Wade,
he could take the plea.

408
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:28,736
- Call them.
- Who's them? The cops?

409
00:58:28,737 --> 00:58:30,914
Your family.

410
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,916
What do you want me to say?

411
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:46,221
We're all gonna...
we're all gonna meet up

412
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:50,960
somewhere public,
and this is gonna end.

413
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,663
Okay.

414
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,969
Don't say my name,
and don't mention the gun.

415
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,940
And we're in Kentucky.

416
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,277
You ever been to Kentucky?

417
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:12,013
Hey, call me back now.

418
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:14,351
They're not answering.

419
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,061
Can I call the house?

420
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:32,834
Yeah.

421
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,104
Shut up.
I'm fine.

422
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,671
It's my leg.

423
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:39,306
Yeah, I'm with him.
He's here.

424
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:41,709
I'll try, but we already
been through that.

425
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,910
All right.

426
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:44,279
She wants to talk to you.

427
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,015
- Who's she?
- My sister.

428
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:50,352
- She's bossy.
- Throw it on the ground.

429
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,819
Keep that thing pointed right
at my face.

430
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,023
I ain't going anywhere.

431
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,689
Turn your head.

432
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,896
Look away.

433
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:03,230
It's all over
as far as I'm concerned.

434
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,066
You hear that, sis?

435
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:07,302
Don't go starting...

436
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,640
There's nobody home,
stupid fuck!

437
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,042
They're hunting.

438
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,913
Yeah!
Fuck!

439
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:19,147
Fucking legs are asleep.

440
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,883
I'll die.
I should.

441
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,819
But my sister
never did anything to you.

442
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,224
So please just tell me.

443
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:30,795
You bet.

444
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:37,031
I got the gun.
You get the truth.

445
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:40,134
Not to satisfy
your fucking curiosity, Dwight.

446
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:42,037
Just know that the man
that killed your parents

447
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,205
didn't die by your hand.

448
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:48,910
He smoked and he drank and he...

449
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:51,712
I guess he didn't fuck
'cause of the cancer,

450
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,948
but he watched
all his favorite TV shows,

451
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,384
and he died a free man.

452
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:59,254
You're gonna die
like your whore father did.

453
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,290
Shot in the fucking face.

454
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,959
Or how about first
we open up that belly?

455
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,294
You want to see your guts steam?

456
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:11,232
Must have something in there,
since you took Wade from us.

457
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:13,735
And for that your sis...

458
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,944
Wait.

459
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,452
Just the one?

460
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,953
- Yes!
- Sorry.

461
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:36,924
I had to wait for him to aim
before I could shoot.

462
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:40,428
It had to be legal,
at least on my part.

463
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:43,365
His... his head...

464
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:46,005
That's what bullets do.

465
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:53,445
Jesus.
I am not impressed.

466
01:01:57,445 --> 01:01:59,818
You missed from two yards?

467
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:05,185
Hey, let's go, man.

468
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:07,388
I'd like him off my property.

469
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:08,793
- OK.
- Come on.

470
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:15,129
One, two, three.

471
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,797
This is Wade Cleland?

472
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:19,000
It's his older brother.

473
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,972
Wade's already dead.

474
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,506
Wipe this off your face.

475
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,974
He's probably got hepatitis.

476
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:32,820
Pick that up.
Throw that in here.

477
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,527
Don't forget to wipe that off
before you get rid of it.

478
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,160
You got the keys?

479
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:47,194
Yeah.

480
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:48,333
Show them to me.

481
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,371
What about the rest of his head?

482
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:58,973
Coyotes will get that.

483
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:00,246
Long as there's no teeth.

484
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:07,314
They're not gonna
let this end...

485
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:09,318
Not now.

486
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,287
Yeah.

487
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:16,425
Well, I'm switching you
to buckshot.

488
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:24,899
Yeah.

489
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,533
Doesn't have the stopping power
of a 12-gauge,

490
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:29,037
but you seem comfortable
with it.

491
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:34,075
It shoots slugs too,
but you wouldn't hit anything.

492
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,910
It's only five shots, though,

493
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,446
so the Steyr
is your secondary weapon.

494
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,080
You get another eight rounds,

495
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:42,318
plus you got the stopping power
of a .45.

496
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:51,125
Hey.

497
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:53,895
Hey, man.

498
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,129
I know this is personal.

499
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,399
That's how you'll fail.

500
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,901
No speeches.

501
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,870
No talking.

502
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,872
You point the gun.

503
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,217
You shoot the gun.

504
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:19,963
Hey, I threw a few MREs in here.

505
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:31,566
Uh...

506
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:34,301
Nice.

507
01:04:34,302 --> 01:04:36,471
I lost mine.

508
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,640
Or shot holes in it.

509
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,408
I'm sorry...

510
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:42,542
I brought all this to you.

511
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,279
I'm glad you did.

512
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,448
Otherwise you'd be dead.

513
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:49,683
You know what I mean.

514
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:53,556
If it were my family, I might do the same.
I don't know.

515
01:04:55,556 --> 01:04:58,593
But I'm not helping out
'cause this is right.

516
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,032
This is ugly, man.

517
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,000
If you ever find that Polaroid

518
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,669
of us and the stripper,

519
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,203
do me a favor.

520
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:10,074
Yeah?

521
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,378
Destroy it.

522
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:18,532

- It's him!
- I'm sorry.

595

<i>I'm sorry to bother you at home.</i>

- I took all the guns.
- Don't shoot us.

601
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:59,922
I've been here awhile.

602
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:05,925
I've been trying
to think of reasons

603
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:10,301
not to do this,
to end your family.

604
01:21:14,301 --> 01:21:16,507
I mean, there's a thousand.

605
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:23,010
But there's one why I should.

606
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,917
Fine.
We'll leave her out.

607
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,220
How can I trust that?

608
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,421
After everything I've done.

609
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:37,260
It's not our problem.

610
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,560
Yes, it is.

611
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:44,497
- Go! Blow his head off!
- Kill him, William!

612
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:48,171
- I don't want to.
- Your whole family will die.

613
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:56,578
Stop!

614
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:01,547
I don't know much about guns,

615
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:05,117
but I'm pretty sure
I've got more bullets than you.

616
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:06,486
Don't kill him.

617
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:10,426
If he dies tonight,
your father killed him.

618
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:14,372
He killed everybody here.

619
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,210
I think you did your job,
William,

620
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:34,715
but I still got to finish up.

621
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,552
Quickly, I think.

622
01:22:38,552 --> 01:22:40,489
It's funny.

623
01:22:42,489 --> 01:22:45,127
That hurts less than the, um...

624
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:49,198
The arrow.

625
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:53,599
You can leave that gun.

626
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,105
Just wipe it off.

627
01:22:58,105 --> 01:23:02,675
My car's down the road a ways
in the woods.

628
01:23:02,676 --> 01:23:04,350
But it's dark.

629
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,256
He's my father's son.

630
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:19,225
Teddy told me about Big Wade,
the cancer.

631
01:23:19,226 --> 01:23:22,295
Don't you mention their names.

632
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,363
You know what's awful?

633
01:23:24,364 --> 01:23:30,672
Just 'cause my dad loved
your mom...

634
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:35,511
...we all end up dead.

635
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:24,724
The keys are in the car.

636
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:29,667
