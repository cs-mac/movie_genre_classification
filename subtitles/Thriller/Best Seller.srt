Hey, you can't
put that up there.

15
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:32,703
Did you hear what I said?

16
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:25,553
That's what they spotted when they
went after him. That's a good watch.

17
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,054
Is that blood on it?

18
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,155
Yeah, they stabbed him 14 times.

19
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,892
Do not move!

20
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,627
Come outside! Put your
hand on the gate!

21
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,466
Where's the other guy?

22
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:46,402
- Rothman!
- What now?

23
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,937
Get your sweet
little ass out here.

24
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,172
Come outside! Put
your hands on the gate!

25
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,081
We're going to locker number 84.

26
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,715
You! You're helping him.

27
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,071
Stop!

28
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,243
Put it down!

29
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,346
Back to the wall.

30
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,394
Tell me, where do you get
all your good information?

31
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:53,424
From Rothman.

32
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,858
I don't know anything about it.

33
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,159
Sure you do, Fred.

34
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,428
Take me with you.

35
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,096
Go ahead.
Get in the truck.

36
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,331
Oh, Fred, take this
with you, will you?

37
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,536
I can't breathe.

38
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,204
Your friend isn't fit for duty.

39
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,674
You don't look so good yourself.

40
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,290
You've got balls of steel,
my friend.

<i>With difficulty.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:16,259
Take him.
I'll get the goods.

Police! Don't make me
chase you, asshole!

Freeze!

80
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,415

I'm a cop.

81

Come on!

82
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:36,129
Okay, asshole, drive! Come
on, motherfucker, drive!

83
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,235
I ain't driving nowhere, motherfucker.
I'm on my break.

84
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,145
You stay back, it's
a police emergency.

85
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,293
Will you get the hell out
of here before you get hurt?

86
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,295
Can I help you,
pal?

87
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,039
Careful, Dennis.

88
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,836
I'm getting too
old for this shit.

89
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:06,205
Maybe the guy
was in on the play.

90
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:08,240
You sure you didn't know him?

91
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,508
No, but he knew me.

92
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,043
See if there are any
prints on the shell cases.

93
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,077
There won't be.

94
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,937
Good morning, Dad.

95
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,705
Good morning, sweetie.

96
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,907
Do you want some eggs?

97
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,208
Did you cook them?

98
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,810
Yes.

99
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,978
I think I'll just have
some coffee then. Hmm?

100
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,212
Hmm.

101
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,549
So, do you have any money left
over from the pizza last night?

102
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:36,917
Nope.

103
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,452
We picked up these boys
afterwards, took 'em to a bar.

104
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,887
Spent everything we had.
You know how it is.

105
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,456
Very funny.

106
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,724
Listen, don't forget you have
to pick up your bus pass today.

107
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:48,759
Otherwise you're gonna
have to pay your own fare.

108
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,560
Maybe your friend will
give me another ride.

109
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:52,228
Who's that?

110
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,797
This guy.
He's a friend of yours.

111
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,732
He took me and my friends home.

112
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,569
What's he look like?

113
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,836
He's a nice guy.

114
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,804
Kind of thin.
Good dresser.

115
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,772
He knows all about us.

116
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:09,474
He knows that Mom
is dead and everything.

117
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,710
He says he saved your life.

118
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,212
Christ! What's
the matter with you?

119
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:17,348
Don't you know enough not to get
into a car driven by a stranger?

120
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,682
There were three of us.

121
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,685
That doesn't make
any difference, Holly.

122
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,687
Anyway, nothing happened.
That's not the point.

123
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,355
You know him.
I don't know him.

124
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,092
I don't know him.
I met him.

125
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,361
I don't know anything about him.

126
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:39,232
He sure knows you.

127
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,367
<i>Mr. Meechum,
I'm not in business</i>

128
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:44,470
to bring legal action
against our authors.

129
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:47,406
We are in the
publishing business.

130
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:51,209
We've been very patient.
You've missed four deadlines.

131
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,211
Oh, come on, let's be realistic.
Nobody's gonna sue.

132
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,712
What about a movie deal?

133
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,674
There's no interest in that area.
None whatsoever.

134
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,282
What genius screwed that up?

135
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:02,285
No one screwed anything up,
Mr. Meechum.

136
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,319
Just don't expect Hollywood
to bail you out.

137
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,463
Meech, this one just came in.

138
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:20,064
Some guy says your daughter

139
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,299
left her geometry book
in the back of his car.

140
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,469
Who was it?

141
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,070
He said that you'd know.

142
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,138
He wants you to meet
him there tonight.

143
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:48,145
All right. All right, you wanted me here.
You got me.

144
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,713
Now what?
Don't step forward.

145
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,216
It's a long drop.

146
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,452
Put the light out, please,
and we'll talk.

147
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:03,524
I like the books you write,
especially the first one.

148
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:06,894
Now, listen to me. You
stay away from me.

149
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,362
And you stay away
from my daughter.

150
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:10,664
I'm sorry about that, Dennis.

151
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,198
I had to get your attention.

152
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,699
Yeah,
well, you got it.

153
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,534
She's a lovely girl.

154
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,369
You've done a good job,

155
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,604
especially without a
wife to help you out.

156
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:25,676
All right, what
the hell do you want?

157
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,244
I want you to write
another book.

158
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,778
Well, that's exactly
what I'm doing.

159
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,615
Come on, Dennis. Since Kate died,
you can't get past page 15.

160
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,483
You can't write and you're
sick of being a cop.

161
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,484
You're a burnout.

162
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,920
And those unpaid bills?

163
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:43,155
You've got people after you, Dennis.
They want their money.

164
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,191
I can help you.

165
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,459
I don't need your help.
Yes, you do

166
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,928
and you're gonna get my help
handed to you on a silver platter.

167
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,231
A bestseller.
It's about me, Dennis.

168
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,800
It's about me and
the man I work for.

169
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,634
You're crazy.

170
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,135
Yeah. Well...

171
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,271
Well, it's a crazy world.

172
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:19,251
Well, that's twice.

173
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,952
All right, what have you got
that you think is worth telling?

174
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:23,587
Hey!

175
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,020
Hey!

176
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,768
Good group.

177
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,105
Old habit.

178
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,716
It's a good weapon,
the Smith and Wesson .38.

179
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:10,485
It's accurate, it's
reliable, a little light.

180
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:11,752
Want to try mine?

181
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,236
You're under arrest. You have
the right to remain silent...

182
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,337
You know, I
thought this was gonna be

183
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,172
a friendly meeting
on neutral ground.

184
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,174
You killed a man. Hire an attorney.
Now spread 'em.

185
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:39,943
High and wide.

186
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:40,945
You're embarrassing me.

187
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:47,783
I assumed you were
brighter than this.

188
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,385
I thought by now you'd
be looking for an angle.

189
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:53,788
Some way of handling me in the
book, making me sympathetic.

190
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,890
You're truly disappointing me,
Dennis.

191
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:58,225
I'm talking about David
Madlock, Kappa International!

192
00:21:58,227 --> 00:22:01,628
I'm talking about murder!
Now, take these cuffs off me!

193
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,396
What do you think you're selling?
Mafia hitman?

194
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:05,464
Nobody buys that shit anymore.

195
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,265
Isn't this sinking into
your thick cop skull?

196
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,467
I'm telling you that I
helped to make David Madlock

197
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,236
and Kappa International and
I did it by killing people.

198
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,471
The ones in the scrapbook.
Get it?

199
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:16,139
Corporations don't
have people killed.

200
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:18,274
Oh.

201
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:22,811
Corporations deal in two things, period.
Assets and liabilities.

202
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:26,214
I removed the liabilities and I
provided some of the assets.

203
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:30,785
I was a corporate executive in charge
of just those things. Believe me.

204
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:33,921
And you were in on it, Dennis.
At the very beginning.

205
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:35,322
We both were.

206
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,462
Never imagined how irritating
those things could be.

207
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,830
You've got about three minutes
before they get back on.

208
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,898
Start talking.

209
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,633
It's all a question
of capital, Dennis.

210
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,302
How does an ambitious man get started?
Capital.

211
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,504
Now David Madlock
is an unusual man.

212
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,739
He got unusual financing.

213
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,407
You wrote about that
particular source of financing

214
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,509
in your first book, in fact.

215
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,077
The depository hit.

216
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,310
That's right.

217
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:07,912
You were in on that?

218
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:09,747
That's right.

219
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:13,016
Oh, yeah? Well, two
cops died that day

220
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,685
and one of them was a nice old
man waiting for his pension.

221
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,820
That is the second time
you have embarrassed me.

222
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,421
Now, try to control
yourself, please.

223
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,626
I drove.
That's all I did.

224
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:27,928
The three who were inside died.

225
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,430
The one that you stabbed died of
peritonitis a week later, okay?

226
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:31,697
That still leaves you.

227
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,665
Like I said, I drove.
You want me, here I am.

228
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,387
But I got 12 people who will swear
I was in Chicago that day all day.

229
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:44,841
All right.
Tell me about the money.

230
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:47,810
Two and a half million
1972 dollars, tax-free.

231
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:49,278
Seed money.

232
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,179
It's the American way, Dennis.

233
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,582
Kappa International was formed six
months later on venture capital.

234
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:01,888
Can't let this one
get by you, Dennis.

235
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:06,858
Bestseller.

236
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,794
You say you started off as a shooter for
this guy. And you become a defector...

237
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:10,961
Defector? No, no.

238
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,529
He threw me out.

239
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,865
I wanted something

240
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,067
more than I had.

241
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,202
I'm a businessman.
An executive.

242
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,270
I wanted

243
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,671
respect.

244
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,639
He offered money.

245
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:30,675
I help him get started,
he offers me a handout?

246
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,209
Why don't you
testify against him?

247
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:33,977
Oh, he can buy his
way out of anything.

248
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,313
Except for the book.

249
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,714
Exactly!

250
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:42,785
Dennis,

251
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:44,019
together, you and I can
do such a number on him.

252
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:45,720
I can tie him into all of it.

253
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:47,955
You need me.

254
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:50,590
We need each other.

255
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:57,995
How did you find out?

256
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,198
She felt this bump.

257
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,732
Right here, inside her elbow.

258
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,867
Malignant?

259
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:07,189
They opened her up, took one
look, sewed her back up again.

260
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:10,504
After that, she lost weight,

261
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,838
she started losing her hair.

262
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,275
After a little while,
she'd look at me,

263
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:18,009
didn't know who I was.
Hmm.

264
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:22,011
Then all the money went.

265
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,513
I just wanted her to stay alive.

266
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,182
But she didn't.

267
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:31,717
After that, you couldn't work.

268
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,519
I should have sold the
house, but I couldn't.

269
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:35,553
It was her house.

270
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,456
That's right.
It was her house.

271
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,292
You loved her more than you could
ever love anyone in your life.

272
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,429
Just don't talk about her,
all right?

273
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:49,897
Hey, Dennis,

274
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,700
I understand.

275
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,802
She's the clean part of your
life, I'm the dirty part.

276
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,370
The criminal.

277
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:02,854
But you and I know things other
people don't, don't we, Dennis? Hmm?

278
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:08,211
How it feels to kill
a man, for instance.

279
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,246
Cop. Killer.

280
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:11,647
Two sides of the same coin.

281
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:12,781
Hmm?

282
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,549
We have a natural bond,
you and I.

283
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:16,683
No.
Yes.

284
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,651
No. We don't have
anything in common.

285
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:20,419
I don't have anything
in common with you.

286
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:21,421
We'll see.

287
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:28,291
We'll see.

288
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,642
Hey.

289
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,514
You okay?

290
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:56,633
Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.

291
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:58,751
I just couldn't fall
asleep, that's all.

292
00:26:58,753 --> 00:26:59,753
You go back to bed.

293
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,021
Can I have a sip?

294
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,557
Yeah.
Just a sip, though.

295
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,559
Okay.

296
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,595
Thanks.

297
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,697
You're welcome, princess.

298
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,198
Good night.
Good night.

299
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:24,037
I'm fine.

300
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:25,806
Okay.

301
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,077
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

302
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,978
<i>may I have your
attention, please?</i>

303
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,815
<i>I'd like to propose a toast to
my good friend, David Madlock</i>

304
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,617
<i>for his continuing
generosity and compassion.</i>

305
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:48,963
<i>Thank you, Senator.
Thank you.</i>

306
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,290
There he is.

307
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,926
Dennis, what do you think
this place is worth?

308
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,994
15, 20 million dollars?

309
00:27:56,996 --> 00:28:01,331
He donates it to the city like
that for the common folk to enjoy.

310
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,000
That man is the history
of America incarnate.

311
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:06,902
A modern robber baron.

312
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,103
Now, they built this country.

313
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,839
They deserve special treatment.

314
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:14,509
<i>I just wanted to return something
to this extraordinary city</i>

315
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,211
<i>which has given me so much.</i>

316
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,412
<i>Thank you.</i>

317
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:21,913
Wonderful!

318
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:32,434
More than anyone will
ever know, eh, David?

319
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:38,858
<i>Yes. More than
anyone will ever know.</i>

320
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,330
What a delightful surprise.

321
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:47,698
I'm so glad you could come.

322
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,832
I wouldn't miss it.

323
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,466
And you must be
Lieutenant Meechum.

324
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,801
I'm an admirer of your work,
especially your last book.

325
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:55,503
Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you.

326
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:56,937
When will we see another one?

327
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:59,773
Dennis is working on something
new, as a matter of fact.

328
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,474
Non-fiction.

329
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:04,777
Ah. I'll look
forward to it.

330
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,946
I'm a great fan of yours.
It's been too long, Cleve.

331
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,682
Much too long.

332
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,486
Pretty smooth.

333
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,954
He's incredible,
isn't he?

334
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,123
Here it comes.

335
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,460
David! David,
we must be leaving.

336
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:27,361
We'll see you around, I hope.

337
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:44,677
We've got him on the run.

338
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:48,914
Okay, so you know the guy.
What does that prove?

339
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,148
You're a hard man to convince.

340
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,482
Mmm-hmm.
I like that.

341
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:52,782
Yeah.

342
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,051
What the hell
are you doing here?

343
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:58,819
You think
I'm approving overtime?

344
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:00,320
Hey, relax. It's on me.

345
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,991
I'm gonna need a few
days, Monks. Out of town.

346
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:06,392
I think I'm onto something.

347
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,394
What?

348
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,661
I can't tell you.

349
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:11,828
Make it sick leave if
you want, all right?

350
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,430
I'm way overdue.

351
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:17,366
Just what the department
needs, mystery crime fighter.

352
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:19,101
I got to play this
one out, Monks.

353
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,271
I want this guy.

354
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,640
I mean, I really want him.

355
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:35,472
<i>Beltzer was
an auditor for the IRS.</i>

356
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,941
He fell in his shower,
cracked his skull.

357
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,575
They found him dead.

358
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:40,609
And you killed him.

359
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,611
Why?

360
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:43,812
It's a service I performed.
That's the profession I was in.

361
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:45,814
Okay.
Why did he have to die?

362
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,016
Because he carried this
with him at all times.

363
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:50,351
He was one of those
meticulous, fussy, little men

364
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:54,021
and somehow he got it in his head that Kappa
International was keeping two sets of books.

365
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:56,656
He had a nose for that kind
of thing. See? Kappa. Kappa.

366
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:58,824
Again Kappa. Hmm?

367
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:01,259
He was not going
to close that audit.

368
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:02,960
Two years later, it was
a member of the SEC.

369
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,495
Fell asleep at the wheel.
Head on over a divider, dead.

370
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,463
You know something, Cleve?
You're full of shit.

371
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:09,798
What is that even
supposed to mean?

372
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,432
What is it supposed to mean? You could've
forged that little beauty yourself.

373
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,167
You could've picked it up in a
public toilet, for Christ's sake.

374
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,801
This isn't evidence.
This is bullshit!

375
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:16,202
So maybe next time,
I'll take pictures!

376
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:17,670
Is that what you'd like?
Stop wasting my time!

377
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,271
Fine!

378
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,513
Let's get the hell out of here.

379
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,208
We're going to the airport.

380
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,580
What about the other stops?

381
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,214
Tell it to the Manhattan
DA, all right?

382
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,915
I'm not interested anymore.

383
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:34,917
All right.

384
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:57,469
Hey, mind if I go
for a pack of butts?

385
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:23,661
Get out.

386
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,341
You're interested
again, aren't you?

387
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:52,289
Come on.

388
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,693
It wasn't even my cab.

389
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:10,195
I was just told to pick
you guys up and ditch you.

390
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:12,597
I didn't know
it was a torch job.

391
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,432
Yeah, right.
Who were they?

392
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:18,301
I don't know. I never
seen them before!

393
00:35:18,303 --> 00:35:20,136
Not good enough.
Take it easy.

394
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:21,971
He tried to kill us.

395
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,739
Pearlman?
I don't know.

396
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,240
Brennan?
I don't know.

397
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:26,774
Thorn?
I don't know.

398
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:29,109
Don't be an asshole.
Talk to the man.

399
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:35,313
No!

400
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,815
It was Thorn and Pearlman.

401
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,449
You're making me a dead man.

402
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:41,483
Maybe.

403
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:53,293
Hey, cab!

404
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:30,663
What the hell was
that all about?

405
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,031
It was nothing. Forget it.

406
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,033
Brooklyn Heights.

407
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:23,746
See him?

408
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:24,748
Yep.

409
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:33,721
Mrs. Foster?

410
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:37,524
Yes?

411
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:39,993
My name is Bowen. Alan Bowen.

412
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,061
This is Mr. Gilbert,
my associate.

413
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:44,263
And we're very sorry
to disturb you,

414
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:47,199
but we're in town for the evening,
you know, on business and...

415
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:51,236
My father used
to own this house.

416
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,037
I grew up here.

417
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,605
Oh, that Mr. Bowen.

418
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,408
Yes. Would you think it strange
if I were to ask you...

419
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,243
Could I see my old room?

420
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,578
Well, I don't know.
It's...

421
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,680
No. You're
absolutely right.

422
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,915
I mean, it's very late
and we are strangers.

423
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,284
Thank you.
Thank you anyway.

424
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,620
Wait.

425
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:19,923
Of course
you can come in, son.

426
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,457
Are you sure?
Yes.

427
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,125
You seem like nice boys.

428
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:24,526
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

429
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:32,633
Like some coffee?
I was just making some.

430
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:34,201
No, no, no, thanks.
Don't trouble yourself.

431
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:35,569
We really don't have any time.

432
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,237
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

433
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,573
You know...
Is this different?

434
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:43,275
There used to be a wallpaper here
with little blue cornflowers on it...

435
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:46,478
Yes, well, the white went
better with the furniture.

436
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,279
You just go on up.
Make yourself at home.

437
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:51,215
You sure it's all right?
Oh, yes, of course.

438
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:52,950
Just take all the
time you want to.

439
00:38:52,952 --> 00:38:54,117
I'll just make that coffee.

440
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,351
Thank you.

441
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:00,823
Right there is
where it happened.

442
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,825
The old man's bathroom.

443
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,660
The bathroom is a natural place
for an accident to happen,

444
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:06,328
don't you think?

445
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,330
Oh, yeah.
Very natural.

446
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:13,467
I came in through
the kitchen window.

447
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:15,602
It was a hot night.
The window was open.

448
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,904
I had to hole
up until 11:00,

449
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,972
when the old man took his bath.

450
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:21,073
You know what I did?

451
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:27,311
<i>I took a nap
in the guest room.</i>

452
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:30,080
<i>Just before 11:00,
I got up.</i>

453
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:32,816
<i>I went down the hallway.</i>

454
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,851
<i>There was a little glass
of bourbon with hot water</i>

455
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:36,185
<i>next to the tub.</i>

456
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:41,289
<i>The maid had gone to bed.</i>

457
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,425
<i>This poor man had made the mistake of
going into business with David Madlock.</i>

458
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:47,528
<i>It was all a matter of patents,
manufacturing licenses.</i>

459
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,364
<i>The old man wanted to keep them.</i>

460
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:54,267
His only sin was he
didn't want to be rich.

461
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,770
He liked this street,
this house.

462
00:39:57,772 --> 00:40:00,239
A man can be dangerous when
he doesn't care about money.

463
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,310
Well said, Dennis.

464
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:09,147
Bye!

465
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,314
What a lovely old lady.

466
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:14,549
Can you imagine
letting two strange men

467
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:17,552
into your house in the middle
of the night in New York City?

468
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:20,888
That's good old-fashioned trust.
Faith in human nature.

469
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,024
God, that's what made this country
the greatest in the world.

470
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,826
All right. You've been
inside the house.

471
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:29,228
That doesn't prove you
killed anybody in there.

472
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,963
But you know I did,
don't you, Dennis?

473
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,731
Don't you?

474
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,599
Maybe.

475
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:37,601
Maybe you did.

476
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,825
It's been here
about eight years.

477
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,093
Ballistics should have
something to work with.

478
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:11,431
An old
Springfield .30-06.

479
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,167
Which one was it?

480
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:18,737
Danzig and his wife.
Mr. and Mrs. Phillip H.

481
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:21,039
They're the only ones that didn't
come off like an accident.

482
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,708
January 14, 1979.

483
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,876
What were you doing
that night, Dennis?

484
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:29,546
Making love to your wife,
safe and snug in your bed?

485
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:32,615
They were, too, the Danzigs. 10
seconds later, they were dead.

486
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,019
Why the wife?

487
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:40,222
She was his bookkeeper. She
knew more about us than he did.

488
00:41:40,224 --> 00:41:43,091
They were greedy.
Always demanding more.

489
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,726
They deserved what they got.
Believe me.

490
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:50,363
You gotta understand, Dennis,
this was the business I was in.

491
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:53,465
I can nail you with this,
not Madlock.

492
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,469
The book, Dennis.

493
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:00,137
The book will take
care of Madlock.

494
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,826
Marvelous.

495
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:07,664
Marvelous.

496
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:09,263
Thanks.

497
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,541
You never have to leave
a bar alone, Dennis.

498
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:24,477
Look at these women.
Huh?

499
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,178
You could leave
with any one of them.

500
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:30,081
That rifle's not going to
do you any good, Cleve.

501
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,984
The bore was gone.

502
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,952
They tried to fire a round through
it to get the groove markings.

503
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:37,853
The whole barrel blew apart.

504
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:40,287
Madlock.

505
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,023
Jesus! Madlock!

506
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:46,325
Madlock. The conspiracy
theory, right?

507
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,794
God, you can be incredibly
stupid at times, Dennis.

508
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,396
Stupid and naive and unutterably tiresome.
Do you know that?

509
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:54,365
Bullshit! I just don't happen to believe
Madlock or anyone else for that matter

510
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:57,534
can get a major metropolitan police
department to destroy evidence.

511
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,338
Forget it.

512
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,473
Where's the waitress?

513
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,046
Hello?

514
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:15,815
Please.

515
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,858
You wouldn't happen to have a friend for
my kid brother over there, would you?

516
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,927
I'm afraid he's not
your brother's type.

517
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:31,161
My mistake.

518
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:32,929
That's right, man.
She's with me.

519
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,764
Yes, I know, she just told me.
No offense, okay?

520
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:36,766
Okay. Then beat it.

521
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:42,770
Yeah, right.

522
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:44,671
Can I get a scotch
on the rocks, please?

523
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:51,877
I didn't say order a drink.
I said get lost.

524
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:54,045
The problem we have here is that
I'm the lover in the family.

525
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:56,213
You wanna talk to my brother.
He's the fighter. See?

526
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:00,050
24 straight knockouts.

527
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:01,351
Almost killed a couple of guys.

528
00:45:01,353 --> 00:45:02,418
Just talk to him.

529
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:04,619
Let him go.

530
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:09,744
Now, sit down
and finish your drink.

531
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:16,262
Put this on my tab.

532
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:28,706
Thanks, Dennis.

533
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:33,343
I didn't want you to hurt him.

534
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:35,978
I could have.
You know that, don't you?

535
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,280
Yeah.

536
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,953
May I show you something?

537
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:56,662
Excuse me. May I have
a cigarette, please?

538
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:57,763
Sure.

539
00:45:57,765 --> 00:45:59,397
This will be just fine.
Thanks.

540
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:06,102
Filthy habit.

541
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:10,338
Willpower is what distinguishes the
amateur from the professional.

542
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,739
Which are you, Dennis?
Hmm?

543
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,109
Tender part here.

544
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:18,910
Nerves close to the surface.

545
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,454
Pain doesn't bother me,
Dennis. I don't let it.

546
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:35,189
That's what I mean by willpower.

547
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,291
Do you have it, Dennis?

548
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:39,761
Willpower?

549
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:43,262
Let's hope so.

550
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:52,069
I like you, Dennis.

551
00:46:52,071 --> 00:46:54,604
I really do.
I like you a lot.

552
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:56,672
But not enough to
sacrifice the book for.

553
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:05,880
How long have you had
this little hobby, Cleve?

554
00:47:05,882 --> 00:47:08,315
Since I was about 15. I used
to use it to impress girls.

555
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:11,817
Come on.

556
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:14,151
Son of a bitch!

557
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:16,386
Did I hurt you, Cleve? Huh?

558
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:17,754
Tell me when it hurts.
Easy! Easy!

559
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:19,322
Tell me when it hurts,
damn it. I wanna know!

560
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:20,324
Get a cop.

561
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,790
I'll get a doctor.

562
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:26,159
It's okay.

563
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,728
It's okay. He's my brother.
I just said the wrong thing.

564
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,596
You guys
have got to leave.

565
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,465
No, I'm sorry.
This happens...

566
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:34,899
This happens all the time.

567
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:36,800
I just said the wrong thing,
really.

568
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:40,103
If anything, maybe you'd better
get a doctor for his hand.

569
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,237
Maybe he broke it on my face.

570
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:42,471
It's fine.

571
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:44,606
Okay, well, let's shake hands.
We're even, okay?

572
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,407
Yeah, okay.

573
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,976
Why don't you bring us a couple
of scotches on the rocks, okay?

574
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:50,544
Keep the change. Thank you.

575
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,618
Now you know why I never asked
you to take a shower with me.

576
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,986
You were bound to find out
sooner or later, I guess.

577
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:07,490
It didn't hurt, but
it did almost kill me.

578
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:09,825
The part about the
peritonitis was true.

579
00:48:09,827 --> 00:48:12,193
I'm not gonna bust you, Cleve.
I'm not gonna bust you.

580
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:16,229
I'm gonna kill you.

581
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:21,900
Fair enough, Dennis.
Fair enough.

582
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:26,837
Could I have those
drinks, please?

583
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,946
I can't satisfy her, Dennis.

584
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:44,518
She wants you.

585
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,254
She likes the way you fight.
She thinks you're cruel.

586
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:50,956
She wants you to hurt her.

587
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,560
I don't know, there's some
pretty sick people in the world.

588
00:48:57,363 --> 00:48:59,162
Come on, Dennis.

589
00:48:59,164 --> 00:49:01,264
Didn't you ever share
a woman with a friend?

590
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
Huh?

591
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:09,138
You're absolutely right.
Absolutely right.

592
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,539
Go on and get dressed.
You're going home.

593
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,340
Wait a goddamn minute.

594
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:13,774
Shut your mouth.

595
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:15,741
Jesus!

596
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:17,442
You're right.
Pain in the ass.

597
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:21,846
Is this
the greatest, huh?

598
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,481
Look at this place. $1200 a day.

599
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:27,483
I was born for this.
This is what I've worked for.

600
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:30,484
Only in America, Dennis.

601
00:49:32,688 --> 00:49:34,421
Only in America.

602
00:49:34,423 --> 00:49:36,089
I wanna meet your family, Cleve.

603
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:42,928
Totally out
of the question.

604
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,531
No, we're going home, Cleve.
We're going home.

605
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,432
It's a very important
part of the story.

606
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:50,767
It's where it all began. It's
what makes you so lovable.

607
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:52,435
Dennis, I said no.

608
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:55,938
Yeah.

609
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,873
Yeah, I bet your mom and dad

610
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,058
still live in the house
where you were born.

611
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:00,242
Am I right, Cleve? Huh?

612
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:02,010
A little farm someplace?

613
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:04,345
Hmm?

614
00:50:04,347 --> 00:50:07,247
Sure.
White picket fence around.

615
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:09,282
The smell of leaves
burning in the fall.

616
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:12,017
Well, we're going to make
that place famous, Cleve.

617
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:15,753
A regular landmark.

618
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:21,057
Yeah, the place where a vicious,
amoral killer was spawned

619
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,758
and set loose on the world. Hmm?

620
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:27,428
We're going to Oregon, Cleve.

621
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:29,996
We're gonna go home.

622
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:10,402
Do you like to shoot, Mr. Meechum?
Quail is in season.

623
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,937
Actually, no, I don't hunt.

624
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:15,005
Dennis doesn't like guns.

625
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:18,475
Oh, a gun's only as good or
bad as the man using it.

626
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:23,380
I'm like Mr. Meechum. Never could
bring myself to kill a living thing.

627
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:25,014
That's right, Harold.

628
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:26,448
You could always
eat the chicken,

629
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,083
but you'd leave the
killing to somebody else.

630
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,685
The doc thought I wasn't
gonna make it through last winter.

631
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:35,855
His mother thought the next time she'd
see him would be at the funeral,

632
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:38,858
and then when you phoned like that,
telling us you were coming...

633
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,626
When did he phone?

634
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:43,228
A week ago. Said he'd
be here in seven days.

635
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,529
And here he is, right
on time to the day.

636
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:50,533
More coffee, Mr. Meechum?

637
00:51:50,535 --> 00:51:53,635
Dad, do you have any more of those cigars?
You know, the cheap ones?

638
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:58,539
No, thanks, I've had enough.

639
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,944
Number three,
St. Louis. Four, London.

640
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:09,714
Five, Chicago. Six, Dallas...

641
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:12,083
They all tally, Dennis.
Check the dates.

642
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,752
I have
checked the dates.

643
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:18,822
A nice little
chronicle of murder.

644
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:21,424
Tell me, what happens to your
family when the book comes out?

645
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:24,627
They'll deny it. Defend me.

646
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:26,729
It'll give them a cause,
a reason to live.

647
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:29,398
Dennis, it'll add 10
years to their lives.

648
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,799
What a thoughtful son you are.

649
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:31,966
I am.

650
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:39,005
You've been planning
this little trip home

651
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,172
the whole time, haven't you?

652
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:43,441
I had to. You had
to take it seriously.

653
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:46,010
This farm. My family.

654
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:50,180
Dennis, I want people to know
what I had to do and why.

655
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:52,182
Oh, they'll know,
Cleve, they'll know.

656
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,351
Rural America,

657
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:57,586
growing up on a farm.
The American dream.

658
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:58,954
Exactly.

659
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:01,523
Only this time...

660
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:05,193
This time something went wrong.

661
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:09,997
This time, these nice country people
produced a mistake of nature.

662
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:13,066
An aberration. A freak.

663
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:17,936
That's all I am to you?

664
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:21,138
A freak?

665
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,508
Get out.

666
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,109
I'm tired.
I want to sleep.

667
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:04,413
A fraction of an inch.

668
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:05,814
The weight of a feather.

669
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,815
That's how
close you are, Dennis.

670
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,353
You wouldn't want to wake
up your mother, would you?

671
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:17,422
I didn't much like
our conversation.

672
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,924
If you pull that trigger, your father's
gonna have to repaper the walls.

673
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,028
All I want is a little respect.

674
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,431
You don't have to like me. Though I
suspect you do, in spite of yourself.

675
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,232
Yeah, there's no doubt
about it, Cleve.

676
00:54:33,234 --> 00:54:34,533
You're a real charmer.

677
00:54:34,535 --> 00:54:36,335
You're not taking this
very seriously, Dennis.

678
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,669
Please...

679
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,142
If you ever aim
a gun at me again,

680
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,111
it better be loaded.

681
00:54:56,349 --> 00:54:58,582
Shall we call this
one a draw, Dennis?

682
00:55:04,954 --> 00:55:06,153
Good night, Cleve.

683
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:21,100
Good night, Dennis.

684
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:33,744
Thanks very much.

685
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:35,545
You'll look
after him, won't you?

686
00:55:35,547 --> 00:55:37,446
I'll do my best.

687
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:39,181
He's never had a big brother.

688
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:41,850
Right.

689
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,108
They're decent people.

690
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,310
Make sure that's
in the book, Dennis.

691
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:12,145
Make sure it's in there
that I love them.

692
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:42,207
Am I coming off lovable?

693
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:46,978
Why don't you buy a copy
of the book and find out?

694
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:49,647
Don't I get a say in it?

695
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:50,649
No.

696
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:05,227
I got you something.

697
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:09,130
Go on. Open it.

698
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,103
Read the back.

699
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:24,476
To Dennis.
From his friend Cleve.

700
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:29,380
A surprise.

701
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:31,448
To celebrate our partnership,
so to speak.

702
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:34,751
I mean, we are partners,
aren't we, Dennis?

703
00:57:34,753 --> 00:57:36,285
In the book, I mean.

704
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,061
It's a Patek Philippe.

705
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:49,829
The best.

706
00:57:52,366 --> 00:57:54,232
Did you...
Did you see the back?

707
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:55,466
I read it.

708
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:58,234
I'm still a cop.

709
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:07,708
And I'm still what I am.
Is that it, Dennis?

710
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,275
Yeah, that's it.

711
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,347
You don't think I'm capable
of doing something

712
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:17,282
decent, something unselfish?

713
00:58:24,123 --> 00:58:25,855
Maybe I'll surprise you.

714
00:58:28,025 --> 00:58:29,290
I doubt it.

715
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:41,567
Lieutenant Meechum, this is Mr. Graham
and his associate, Mr. Pearlman.

716
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:44,102
Mr. Graham's an attorney.

717
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,604
I'll make sure you gentlemen
are not disturbed.

718
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,148
I thought you'd be more comfortable
if we talked to you here,

719
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,049
on your own turf, so to speak.

720
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:05,986
Let me see if I can guess.

721
00:59:07,122 --> 00:59:09,222
You're Madlock's lawyer.

722
00:59:09,224 --> 00:59:11,157
Technically, I
represent Kappa International.

723
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:14,393
It amounts to the same thing.

724
00:59:14,395 --> 00:59:17,829
And I bet you two studied for
the bar together, am I right?

725
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:21,599
Mr. Pearlman is not a lawyer.
He's in public relations.

726
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,169
Public relations?
An image maker, huh?

727
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:26,670
You might say that.

728
00:59:27,806 --> 00:59:29,772
How's the new hair?

729
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,240
It's fine.

730
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:33,109
Looks painful.

731
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:38,946
I wanna talk
to Madlock.

732
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:40,981
He feels that any, uh,

733
00:59:40,983 --> 00:59:44,950
direct communication would
be inappropriate at this time.

734
00:59:46,286 --> 00:59:48,653
It's no secret.

735
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:52,456
Former employees rarely have anything
complimentary to say about their former company.

736
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,758
Oh, I'd love to hear
Madlock's version.

737
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,526
Didn't those people really die?

738
00:59:56,528 --> 00:59:59,929
It's that kind
of irresponsible remark

739
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:02,464
that we feel will be
characteristic of this book.

740
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:04,066
Well, why don't you
let me talk to Madlock?

741
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,367
If he can convince me,
I'll drop it.

742
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,369
No.

743
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:09,102
Then forget it.

744
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:11,204
Try this.

745
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:13,873
I'll tie you up in court
for the next 10 years,

746
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,375
take your house, your car,

747
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:18,110
attach every nickel you earn,

748
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:20,078
even your pension,

749
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,213
which you won't be getting
anyway, because we have friends

750
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:24,248
in every major political
office in the city,

751
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,717
the state and the nation.

752
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:29,552
We're a very big business,
Mr. Meechum.

753
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:32,821
Fuck you.

754
01:00:32,823 --> 01:00:34,956
And fuck your hairy friend.

755
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,524
Hold it.

756
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:38,725
What?

757
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:41,494
I said hold it.

758
01:00:41,496 --> 01:00:44,230
Jesus! Who do you think you are?
Al Pacino, huh?

759
01:00:44,232 --> 01:00:45,598
Don't break
my fucking hand.

760
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,299
I'll break your fucking hand.

761
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:49,067
You're threatening
a police officer

762
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:51,069
on the second floor of the
sergeant's division, scumbag.

763
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,770
I'll kick your fucking goon ass

764
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,805
all the way from here
to Pasadena and back.

765
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:56,840
They'll be picking that new rug
of yours out of the freeway,

766
01:00:56,842 --> 01:00:58,274
you fucking asshole!

767
01:00:58,276 --> 01:00:59,841
Now spread 'em!

768
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:03,978
What's this?

769
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:06,180
Huh?

770
01:01:07,683 --> 01:01:09,015
What's this?

771
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:13,252
I hope you don't have
a permit for this.

772
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:15,420
This man is a licensed
private investigator.

773
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,422
He has a permit
to carry a handgun

774
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,191
anywhere in the
state of California.

775
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:23,327
The only threat that's been made
in this room has been made by you.

776
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:34,437
Public relations, huh?

777
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,373
You really
want to write a book?

778
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,142
I'm prepared to offer you
a substantial cash advance

779
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:45,512
to write an authorized biography of Mr.
Madlock with his full cooperation.

780
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:49,516
Why, you scumbag.
You low-life scumbag.

781
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:53,152
You try to blow me up in a taxi
and now you offer me a bribe?

782
01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:56,288
You tell Mr. Madlock he can
read all about it in my book.

783
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:04,260
I'm sorry you feel that way.

784
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:13,902
Mr. Pearlman.

785
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,270
Mr. Pearlman,
we're leaving now.

786
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:18,905
Good luck with your hair.

787
01:02:31,986 --> 01:02:33,118
Friends of yours?

788
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,319
Business associates.

789
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:53,269
Well, that's most of it.
Couple of chapters to go.

790
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:55,004
It'll ruin Madlock.

791
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,172
You'll get sued.

792
01:02:57,174 --> 01:02:59,240
Good.

793
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,241
I'm dying to see the rest.

794
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:05,477
You like him, don't you?
Cleve, I mean.

795
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:08,378
Yeah.

796
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,747
And you're going to arrest him?

797
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:13,082
Yeah.

798
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:15,084
But first I got one
more trip to make.

799
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:14,742
I'm not fighting.
Do what you want.

800
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:16,810
I don't want Dennis' discards.

801
01:04:18,613 --> 01:04:20,412
So that's who you are.

802
01:04:20,414 --> 01:04:22,514
Poor old Dennis. He turns his
back, you're stepping out on him.

803
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:23,915
Have a good time?

804
01:04:23,917 --> 01:04:24,815
It was a business dinner.

805
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,616
Business.

806
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:28,117
What do you want?
I wanna know how the book is.

807
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:30,419
I wanna know what Dennis
has to say about me.

808
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:31,887
You're in good hands.

809
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:37,024
I can hurt you.

810
01:04:38,193 --> 01:04:39,592
It's not a problem for me.

811
01:04:40,328 --> 01:04:41,726
Do you understand?

812
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:45,162
Am I sympathetic?

813
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:48,264
Will they like me?

814
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:49,266
Hmm?

815
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,300
Please do not lie to me.

816
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:54,868
Is it an important book?

817
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,035
Yes.

818
01:04:58,138 --> 01:05:00,538
Good. Good girl.

819
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:04,875
My God, you must be
beautiful all dressed up.

820
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:06,377
Hmm?

821
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:08,645
Hmm?

822
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:14,516
Those long, sexy legs.

823
01:05:25,695 --> 01:05:27,461
There are some women
in the world,

824
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:30,430
decent, kind women,

825
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,065
women who work all their lives

826
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:34,900
taking care of their families,

827
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:37,101
who never in their
wildest imaginations

828
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:40,070
ever dream

829
01:05:40,872 --> 01:05:42,371
of clothes like these.

830
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,609
What makes you better than them?

831
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,245
Nothing.

832
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:53,312
That's right.

833
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:06,490
That's exactly right.

834
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,865
What makes you
better than they are?

835
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:16,999
Nothing.

836
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:18,233
Nothing.

837
01:06:19,836 --> 01:06:22,002
Now, do you know what I want?

838
01:06:22,004 --> 01:06:24,938
I want a copy of the manuscript.

839
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,740
I don't have one.
I swear to God.

840
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:30,675
If I look

841
01:06:31,711 --> 01:06:34,745
and I find one,

842
01:06:34,747 --> 01:06:38,682
I will hurt you like you
have never been hurt before.

843
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:41,450
I tried to keep a copy,

844
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:43,951
but he took it.

845
01:06:43,953 --> 01:06:45,185
He knew.

846
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:52,291
Good old Dennis.
Of course he did.

847
01:06:58,565 --> 01:07:00,164
I like you.

848
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:08,237
And most of all, we
understand each other.

849
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,006
I'd prefer that Dennis didn't
know we had this conversation.

850
01:07:11,742 --> 01:07:13,007
Okay?

851
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:24,450
You wanted corroboration,
I finally tracked her down.

852
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:26,151
She worked as Hilliard's maid.

853
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:28,319
She was the one who
let me in the house.

854
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:31,955
See, he was gonna lose his seat in the
election, wanted help for four terms.

855
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:33,957
Why didn't Madlock just
let him lose in peace?

856
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:35,391
He had two very
dangerous qualities.

857
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:37,893
He was broke and he was a drunk.

858
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:39,928
Why did she let you in?
Money.

859
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,496
Why isn't she dead?

860
01:07:41,498 --> 01:07:43,664
Because I knew that someday,
I would need her.

861
01:08:17,165 --> 01:08:19,298
I think I never see you again.

862
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,300
Tell my friend
everything about us.

863
01:08:21,302 --> 01:08:23,167
About Senator Hilliard,
the night he died.

864
01:08:25,304 --> 01:08:26,569
Will you hurt me?

865
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,371
Not if you tell the truth.

866
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:38,879
The Senator, he was
not a very nice man.

867
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,880
But what we did, that
wasn't very nice, either.

868
01:08:44,084 --> 01:08:46,117
Look, why do we speak
of this now, huh?

869
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:55,125
It's okay. It's okay.
Just talk to me.

870
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,733
When does your shift end?

871
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:05,735
Midnight.

872
01:09:07,003 --> 01:09:08,102
Take it easy.

873
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:09,235
They're here.

874
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,672
Stay here and stay down.

875
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:54,877
Please, I didn't say anything.

876
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:00,181
Dennis, the woman.

877
01:10:01,884 --> 01:10:03,416
I didn't say anything.

878
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,465
Tell him.
It's all true, isn't it?

879
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,033
Say it!

880
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:57,933
Let her die.

881
01:10:57,935 --> 01:10:59,935
She's my corroboration!

882
01:10:59,937 --> 01:11:02,637
You asshole. He's your corroboration!
Let's get out of here.

883
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:18,385
Son of a bitch.

884
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:20,787
I don't believe this.
Son of a bitch!

885
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:21,888
You helped
me kill four men.

886
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,222
I ought to kill you.

887
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:25,857
You don't kill
people. You arrest them.

888
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:27,792
I kill people.

889
01:11:27,794 --> 01:11:30,461
That's the difference between
us, maybe the only difference.

890
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:32,095
I wanna meet Madlock.

891
01:11:32,097 --> 01:11:33,796
He'll contact you.

892
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:36,631
You're planning to kill
him, too, aren't you?

893
01:11:36,633 --> 01:11:38,866
Maybe. Maybe I am. Yes.

894
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:41,134
Well, forget it.
No more homicides.

895
01:11:41,136 --> 01:11:43,302
It's out of your
hands, my friend.

896
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:45,203
Don't worry, your
conscience will be clear.

897
01:11:45,205 --> 01:11:46,904
I'll be drinking
rum out of coconuts

898
01:11:46,906 --> 01:11:48,739
and screwing
brown-skinned women

899
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:50,207
in some place where
indictments don't count.

900
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:52,275
Maybe I'll come looking for you.

901
01:11:52,277 --> 01:11:54,644
That so?

902
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:56,946
I'd hate to see that,
Dennis. I really would.

903
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:02,251
Why don't you just be a good cop
and leave the killing to me?

904
01:12:02,253 --> 01:12:05,320
I told you, Cleve.
No more killings.

905
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:09,790
We'll take separate flights.
It'll be safer.

906
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,396
<i>Here's
what we have so far.</i>

907
01:12:18,398 --> 01:12:22,233
<i>At least four persons have lost
their lives in tonight's massacre.</i>

908
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:24,668
<i>An undetermined number
of others were injured</i>

909
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,470
<i>including three, possibly
four illegal alien workers.</i>

910
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:29,939
<i>A detective from the
El Paso Police Department</i>

911
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:33,442
<i>told me moments ago that there is no
apparent motive for the shooting.</i>

912
01:12:33,444 --> 01:12:35,844
<i>There are also no clues so far.</i>

913
01:12:35,846 --> 01:12:37,979
<i>We'll stay here most of the night.
We'll keep you posted.</i>

914
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:41,015
<i>Bill Mitchell, News 4, El Paso.
Carol, back to you.</i>

915
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,281
Who are you?

916
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,384
Friend of your father.

917
01:13:55,054 --> 01:13:56,553
No, you're not.

918
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:02,224
What are you afraid of?

919
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,927
I won't hurt you.
I'm your friend.

920
01:14:07,996 --> 01:14:09,595
I won't hurt you.

921
01:14:12,566 --> 01:14:13,932
Try me.

922
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:15,934
Wait upstairs.

923
01:14:15,936 --> 01:14:18,169
You know me. I work
with your father.

924
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:26,175
You're Thorn?

925
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:27,943
What, they thought an amateur
like you could replace me?

926
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:29,177
Come on.

927
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:43,321
Not likely.

928
01:14:49,529 --> 01:14:51,028
Did you hurt him?

929
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:53,530
Just put him out.

930
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:56,366
Get dressed. They'll know you're here.
I wanna take you to a safe place.

931
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,168
Go on, sweetheart.
You'll be fine with me.

932
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:11,045
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

933
01:15:11,047 --> 01:15:13,113
<i>welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport,</i>

934
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:15,315
<i>where the local time
is 10:15</i>

935
01:15:15,317 --> 01:15:17,850
<i>and the temperature is a
very pleasant 68 degrees.</i>

936
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:31,662
I'm not here to hurt you.
Dennis and I need a favor.

937
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,158
Yeah?
You're invited to a party.

938
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,993
Tomorrow.

939
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,427
I don't like parties.

940
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:11,263
Oh, you'll like this one.
Your friend's not invited.

941
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:12,897
Leave him at home.

942
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:33,783
Keep the change.

943
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:48,262
Holly?

944
01:16:57,372 --> 01:16:58,404
Holly!

945
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,386
Needs an ending.

946
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,555
She's in a safe place.

947
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:19,756
You got 10 seconds.

948
01:17:19,758 --> 01:17:21,657
I saved her life.

949
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:24,226
Thorn came for the manuscript.
She walked in on him.

950
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:26,394
Now she's where
they can't get at her.

951
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:28,562
Of course, neither
can you, without me.

952
01:17:28,564 --> 01:17:30,163
Where?

953
01:17:30,165 --> 01:17:31,898
Pull the trigger and they'll
find her before you do.

954
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,233
Go ahead, Dennis,
'cause I'm not afraid to die.

955
01:17:40,607 --> 01:17:43,074
Now, listen to me, Cleve.

956
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,842
Listen to me.

957
01:17:44,844 --> 01:17:46,276
I want my daughter back now.

958
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:51,180
Madlock's contacted you.

959
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:53,749
Fuck Madlock and fuck
the book and fuck you!

960
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:55,751
Where is my kid?

961
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:58,854
I'm telling you she's safe.
She's safer than she'd be here.

962
01:17:58,856 --> 01:18:00,755
You don't know how
these people operate.

963
01:18:00,757 --> 01:18:03,023
You don't have time to find out.
Do you understand?

964
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:13,231
Dennis, I'm all you've got.

965
01:18:20,305 --> 01:18:21,337
Right.

966
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,408
There's only one
thing left to do.

967
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,778
I mean, God, it would
be the perfect ending.

968
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,412
I'm gonna kill him.

969
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:33,881
You'll
never get near him.

970
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:35,649
Anybody can kill anybody.

971
01:18:36,785 --> 01:18:38,785
Even the President, remember?

972
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:51,227
Yeah?

973
01:18:54,131 --> 01:18:55,697
Yeah, all right.

974
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:06,006
They're sending a car
for me in the morning.

975
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:17,348
Jesus Christ, Cleve.
She's only 16 years old.

976
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:20,616
I'm not a monster, Dennis.

977
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:24,185
Just hedging my bets.

978
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,815
Follow me, please,
Mr. Meechum.

979
01:22:01,106 --> 01:22:03,372
Can I get you anything
from the bar, Mr. Meechum?

980
01:22:03,374 --> 01:22:04,873
No.

981
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:07,075
Make yourself comfortable.

982
01:22:07,077 --> 01:22:08,576
Thank you.

983
01:22:40,876 --> 01:22:42,709
How many are there?

984
01:22:42,711 --> 01:22:43,876
Five.

985
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,381
Five?

986
01:22:52,985 --> 01:22:55,318
David always did
underestimate me.

987
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:06,495
First editions.

988
01:23:07,798 --> 01:23:10,298
Every one of them.

989
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,466
It's a shame about the leather.

990
01:23:12,468 --> 01:23:15,569
It gets mildewed.
It's the sea air.

991
01:23:15,571 --> 01:23:18,104
Well, then you buy new ones.

992
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:20,806
And then I buy new ones.

993
01:23:20,808 --> 01:23:23,241
Come on in,
Lieutenant Meechum. Sit down.

994
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:48,465
Forgot to flush.

995
01:23:48,467 --> 01:23:50,767
<i>It was
good of you to come.</i>

996
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:54,103
Little charity thing we do
every year for the kids.

997
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:55,504
Charity.

998
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:57,172
That's right.

999
01:23:57,174 --> 01:24:00,708
We should have had this
meeting a long time ago.

1000
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:02,609
Look, skip the bullshit,
all right, Madlock?

1001
01:24:02,611 --> 01:24:04,711
The book is gonna be published.

1002
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,682
Sherry?

1003
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:11,883
No.

1004
01:24:19,358 --> 01:24:21,858
What's your name?
Turner.

1005
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,259
Put down the cup.

1006
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:27,629
Sorry, Turner.

1007
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:32,566
<i>Our friend has
grown fond of the book.</i>

1008
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,302
<i>He thinks I did a good job.</i>

1009
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:37,337
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

1010
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:39,205
<i>Also, he's got my daughter.</i>

1011
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,306
No, he hasn't.

1012
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:44,342
Your daughter was brought
here this morning

1013
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:46,944
by two members of
your own department.

1014
01:24:48,681 --> 01:24:51,882
Our friend has grown
too fond of you.

1015
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:54,918
Emotion breeds carelessness
in his area of expertise.

1016
01:25:00,024 --> 01:25:02,190
Your daughter's perfectly safe.

1017
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:04,558
She's waiting for you
to take her home.

1018
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:09,228
Of course,
you can always get to her.

1019
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:13,231
Quite simply, yes.

1020
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,433
I can also guarantee
her safety, absolutely,

1021
01:25:17,903 --> 01:25:19,569
and yours,

1022
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:23,405
if you come to work
for Kappa International.

1023
01:25:23,407 --> 01:25:24,906
Then, of course,
you own the book.

1024
01:25:24,908 --> 01:25:26,874
Something like that.

1025
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,176
You can't guarantee
anything, Madlock.

1026
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:35,015
I beg your pardon?

1027
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:36,783
Anybody can kill anybody.

1028
01:25:37,685 --> 01:25:39,151
Even the President.

1029
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:47,257
He's here, isn't he?

1030
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:50,692
What do you think?

1031
01:25:53,629 --> 01:25:55,128
Who is it?

1032
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,195
Turner.

1033
01:25:57,564 --> 01:25:59,130
Who?

1034
01:25:59,132 --> 01:26:01,165
What the fuck?
Are you deaf? It's Turner.

1035
01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:06,770
Go over by the window.
Look outside, sweetheart.

1036
01:26:06,772 --> 01:26:09,539
Get on the bed.

1037
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,107
How'd you get in here?

1038
01:26:11,109 --> 01:26:12,808
You can't imagine how easy it was.
What's your name?

1039
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,477
Carter. Christ! Where does
David find you people?

1040
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:18,046
Skip the insult.
Just get it over with.

1041
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:39,565
<i>You're making
a mistake, Lieutenant.</i>

1042
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:41,633
He's a killer.

1043
01:26:41,635 --> 01:26:43,635
You're helping him.

1044
01:26:43,637 --> 01:26:45,570
That makes you
no better than he is.

1045
01:26:45,572 --> 01:26:47,204
Maybe not.

1046
01:26:49,274 --> 01:26:51,140
But we're both better than you.

1047
01:26:52,676 --> 01:26:54,008
<i>David.</i>

1048
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:56,809
Surprise.

1049
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,313
Seems like old times,
doesn't it, David?

1050
01:27:18,596 --> 01:27:19,962
Carter?

1051
01:27:39,548 --> 01:27:41,080
Jarvis!

1052
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,119
<i>Bad luck, David.</i>

1053
01:27:48,121 --> 01:27:49,520
<i>Nobody left.</i>

1054
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:56,359
Don't leave this room.

1055
01:28:04,735 --> 01:28:07,669
You're a policeman.
You have to protect me.

1056
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:09,470
All right.
Give me the gun.

1057
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,971
No, you're in on it.

1058
01:28:10,973 --> 01:28:12,405
Well, that's a chance
you'll just have to take.

1059
01:28:12,407 --> 01:28:13,407
Come on.

1060
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:16,108
David!

1061
01:28:17,344 --> 01:28:18,910
It's just you and me.

1062
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:22,046
No, Cleve, don't shoot him!

1063
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:23,547
We got him!
He's finished!

1064
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:25,181
He shot a cop.

1065
01:28:25,183 --> 01:28:26,748
It's all over, Cleve.

1066
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:30,584
Can't do it, Dennis.
Sorry.

1067
01:28:32,487 --> 01:28:34,487
Daddy!
Holly. Holly, stay up there!

1068
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:36,121
Stay up there, Holly!

1069
01:28:43,328 --> 01:28:45,127
Don't shoot, Cleve! Don't!

1070
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:51,565
Take it easy, sweetie.
I'll get you.

1071
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:52,666
Cleve...

1072
01:29:01,076 --> 01:29:02,341
Cleve!
For Christ's sake.

1073
01:29:08,181 --> 01:29:10,281
Don't do it, Cleve!
Give it up!

1074
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:19,021
Cleve...

1075
01:29:20,524 --> 01:29:21,623
Please.

1076
01:29:23,893 --> 01:29:25,826
You know I'll kill her.

1077
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:40,740
Here I am, David.

1078
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:56,054
Dad.

1079
01:29:56,056 --> 01:29:57,755
I'm all right.

1080
01:29:57,757 --> 01:30:00,591
Get help.
Get help, honey.

1081
01:30:00,593 --> 01:30:02,492
Take it.
I'm not resisting.

1082
01:30:02,494 --> 01:30:03,893
Daddy!

1083
01:30:14,204 --> 01:30:16,003
No, you don't put
those things on me.

1084
01:30:16,005 --> 01:30:17,571
I don't, huh?

1085
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:26,744
God!

1086
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:34,684
You should have killed him.

1087
01:30:35,787 --> 01:30:37,686
Always the good cop.

1088
01:30:39,256 --> 01:30:41,623
It would have been
the perfect ending.

1089
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:50,330
You should have killed him.

1090
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:55,666
Cleve...

1091
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:00,937
Thanks for saving my kid.

1092
01:31:02,273 --> 01:31:04,039
Don't mention it.

1093
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,773
Except in the book.

1094
01:31:08,377 --> 01:31:09,642
Remember,

1095
01:31:12,713 --> 01:31:14,112
I'm the hero.

1096
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:20,950
Yeah.

1097
01:31:34,797 --> 01:31:36,229
I'll remember.

1098
01:31:48,176 --> 01:31:51,143

one get by you, Dennis.</i>

<i>¶ It's a perfect ending</i>

1122
01:33:31,263 --> 01:33:34,597
<i>¶ The end is so sweet</i>

1123
01:33:34,599 --> 01:33:38,100
<i>¶ It's a perfect ending</i>

1124
01:33:38,102 --> 01:33:41,536
<i>¶ I knew when we began</i>

1125
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:47,374
<i>¶ That a perfect ending
would be ours in the end</i>

1126
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:50,744
<i>¶ We both have a story to tell</i>

1127
01:33:50,746 --> 01:33:54,681
<i>¶ About a life that had been</i>

1128
01:33:54,683 --> 01:33:59,285
<i>¶ Yes, we're two sides
of the same coin</i>

1129
01:34:00,855 --> 01:34:03,188
<i>¶ We ran out of choices</i>

1130
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:08,358
<i>¶ So we joined forces</i>

1131
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:14,764
<i>¶ Now the seeds that we
planted have started growing</i>

1132
01:34:14,766 --> 01:34:18,467
<i>¶ Now we've finally
come together</i>

1133
01:34:18,469 --> 01:34:21,803
<i>¶ Tearing down those walls</i>

1134
01:34:21,805 --> 01:34:24,806
<i>¶ Catching up and matching up</i>

1135
01:34:24,808 --> 01:34:30,511
<i>¶ And now we've got it all</i>

1136
01:34:32,948 --> 01:34:36,449
<i>¶ It's a perfect ending</i>

1137
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:39,718
<i>¶ Our story is complete</i>

1138
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,221
<i>¶ It's a perfect ending</i>

1139
01:34:43,223 --> 01:34:46,457
<i>¶ And the end is so sweet</i>

1140
01:34:46,459 --> 01:34:49,760
<i>¶ It's a perfect ending</i>

1141
01:34:49,762 --> 01:34:53,263
<i>¶ I knew when we began</i>

1142
01:34:53,265 --> 01:34:58,968
<i>¶ That a perfect ending
would be ours in the end ¶</i>
