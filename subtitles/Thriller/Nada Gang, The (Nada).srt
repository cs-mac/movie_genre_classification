1
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,678
- Dad!
- Dad!

2
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,982
Oh, my God! Nora, you just hit me.

3
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,528
Don't take sides, Juanito.
I'm the one who thinks you're cute.

4
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,489
It'll live. It's just a car, not a baby.

5
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,617
Nora, you don't hit a new bimmer.

6
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,076
Mary, it'll be fine.

7
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,580
Pablo, that topiary looks just like Dad.

8
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,583
This one's for you, Juanito,

9
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,460
- and can you get the case out of the trunk?
- Yes.

10
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,961
- Nora?
- What?

11
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,967
What is this, Tijuana? Oh, my gosh.

12
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,653
- Oh, my gosh, you are so slow.
- You're gonna make me drop the cake.

13
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,988
It's heavy, okay?

14
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,157
You, nina, keep away from my stove.

15
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,327
- Do you need any help?
- It's not even done yet.

16
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,501
Oh, my God, that is really thick stew.

17
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,756
For your father's birthday.

18
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,342
They say it brings a bride.

19
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,679
Well, in that case, Carmina,
you can just throw it all out.

20
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,347
Will you lighten up, please?

21
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,974
Nora!

22
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,353
Mary, when we're gone,
who will he have left?

23
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,105
Well, Mom.

24
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,149
Well, she's not very talkative now, is she?

25
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,486
Well, she's beautiful, and she'll never age.

26
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,072
Beauty is not everything.

27
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:46,034
Okay, how would you know? You're 24,
and you seriously have not been kissed.

28
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,619
- Okay, thanks a lot.
- You're, like, Amish.

29
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,954
- Really? Amish?
- Girls!

30
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,751
Girls, are you fighting? On my birthday?

31
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,295
- Dad...
- I hope it is important.

32
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,671
She crashed my car.

33
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,797
- She did?
- Yes!

34
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,217
It'll cost you less than one
of your shopping sprees on Rodeo Drive.

35
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,929
You should go with your sister
on a spree one of these days, you know?

36
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,389
- See?
- See?

37
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,473
- Dad.
- What?

38
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,891
You know what?
There are more important things to do

39
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,728
- than going shopping with her.
- Like giving me a kiss for my birthday.

40
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,688
- Come on. Okay. Like dancing.
- Happy birthday.

41
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,107
- Like, one, two, three. One, two, three.
- Dad...

42
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,943
You can't dance to tacky ranchero music.

43
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,278
- Why not?
- Rancheros are not tacky.

44
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,946
- Yes, it is.
- It's not.

45
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,935
A perfect funeral for him.
Even the mariachis are drunk.

46
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,484
Okay. It's not a criticism.

47
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,822
I can say that.

48
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,199
We are family, no?

49
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,494
And that's what counts.

50
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,666
Aurelia.

51
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,050
Who are they?

52
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,303
Do you know them?

53
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,016
He is your brother.

54
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,855
- We have a brother?
- We have a brother?

55
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,191
His name is Gabe, Jr.

56
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,694
- That's impossible.
- How?

57
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,030
Your father had an affair
before you were born.

58
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,033
Your mother forgave him.

59
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,390
But he's illegitimate.

60
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,559
Mary!

61
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,894
I'm sorry, I just meant...

62
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,228
You don't need to be sorry.

63
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,148
Yes, she does.
And we know what you meant.

64
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,109
But the will says we get a third of his assets.

65
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,070
- "We"?
- Ladies, please.

66
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,698
The will is meaningless.

67
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,910
He didn't want you to know,

68
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,163
but Mr. Dominguez was in bankruptcy.

69
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,373
Bankrupt?

70
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,958
No way.

71
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,337
Listen, your father was a wonderful man,

72
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,130
but a risk-taker.

73
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,843
He wasn't prepared for the economic crisis.

74
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,014
Okay, so what do we have?

75
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,602
A huge amount of debt.

76
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,812
Well, what about the house?

77
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,523
- Let us buy it.
- No.

78
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,941
It's not for sale.

79
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,116
Look, this could benefit us all.

80
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,161
We actually re-sell homes for a living.

81
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,039
And you can stay in the house with us,
if you want to.

82
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,167
Until you're ready to go.

83
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,835
Oh, no! Not the playhouse!

84
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,340
I bet that's Mary.

85
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,469
If you stopped smoking pot,
you wouldn't be...

86
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,347
You do know that possession of marijuana
is illegal?

87
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,641
It's a silly law.

88
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,351
Oh?

89
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,814
Legalize cannabis and tax it,
create a revenue stream for the state.

90
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,109
Conservatives have created
a formidable opposition to it.

91
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,987
Well, someone has to keep us in the dark.

92
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,782
Sorry, I thought you were my sister.

93
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,869
Do I look like your sister?

94
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,203
No.

95
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,040
You're taller, and on time.

96
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,377
I'm Edward, Olivia's brother.

97
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,214
Nora, newly discovered sister-in-law

98
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,342
and law student.

99
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,385
Nice to meet you.

100
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,179
Edward?

101
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,556
- Oh, my God! Look at you.
- Hi.

102
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,602
Olivia, don't infantilize me
in front of this beautiful woman.

103
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,647
Have you met my brother,
the ruthless attorney?

104
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,483
Yes, he looks like he could shred things.

105
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,026
Excuse me.

106
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,450
Does it really look like him?

107
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,202
You never met him?

108
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,915
Did you ever try to?

109
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,669
My mother told me he abandoned us.

110
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,130
That's strange.

111
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,593
I mean, family was so important to him.

112
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,184
Okay.

113
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,687
So, you're poor.

114
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,731
No more shopping.

115
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,442
I'd kill myself.

116
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,486
No high-protein diet.

117
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,239
Poor people only eat carbs.

118
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,907
Wow.

119
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,035
What time is it?

120
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,831
12:05.

121
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,292
Shit, I'm late.

122
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,638
Sorry that I'm late. This smells so good.

123
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,351
Your lips are way red.

124
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,440
Hi.

125
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,900
I'm Edward, her brother.

126
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
How is that possible?
'Cause, like, you look so nice,

127
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,200
and you're, like, so...

128
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,668
Got it. Well, it was very nice meeting you.

129
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,004
Nice to meet you, too.

130
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,589
Edward is staying the night with us.

131
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,591
Your room has the best view
of the mountains,

132
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,634
so he's going to use it.

133
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,680
Really? Well, there's not really
that much room in my bed,

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,474
but I think we can make it work.

135
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,480
After lunch, could you and your sister
please pack your things?

136
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,647
You're joking, right?

137
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,691
No, not at all.

138
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,068
I've been planning on moving you both
to the basement anyway.

139
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,528
I need to re-do those rooms, and...

140
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,654
Wait, what?

141
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,157
I'm not going to the basement
of my own house.

142
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Former house.

143
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,409
- Olivia.
- Gabe.

144
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,703
I have been patient enough.

145
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,206
We have the house, but we cannot
keep the orphans that came with it.

146
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,248
Olivia, please.

147
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,541
Let's discuss this in private.

148
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,418
I'm not going anywhere.

149
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,795
Why not?

150
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,047
I mean,
who wants to be humiliated like this?

151
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,634
Let's go.

152
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,885
But...

153
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,345
I mean, we...

154
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,805
There's so much stuff.

155
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,264
We're gonna need, like, a truck.

156
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,893
Don't bother.
Everything in this house stays. We own it.

157
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,478
That is correct.

158
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,147
And I suggest you sell it,

159
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,983
and see if you can buy yourself some class.

160
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,029
- Mary, let's go. Right now.
- But... But...

161
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,989
How is everything hers?

162
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,160
Nora, what are we gonna do?

163
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,497
Move out now. Come on.
At least the bimmer's in your name.

164
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,290
She can't stop us from taking that.

165
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
Okay, then after that?

166
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,252
I have a plan.

167
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,763
Bye, Carmina. I'll miss you.

168
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,558
- See you later.
- Take care.

169
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,772
This was your father's.

170
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,235
Thank you. Thank you.

171
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,355
So, where are we going?

172
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,774
East LA.

173
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,067
East LA?

174
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:23,171
I am really scared right now, Nora.
Like, we're gonna get shot.

175
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,465
Would you just calm down?

176
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,717
This place is perfectly safe.

177
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,231
Welcome to the barrio, mija.

178
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,400
- Drive. Just drive.
- Oh, my gosh.

179
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,529
Hey, it's fine. Just calm down. Just drive.

180
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,298
Oh, my God.

181
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,801
Really?

182
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,678
What?

183
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,474
Nora, I can't.

184
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,851
Come on, look how happy she is.

185
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,937
She looks like the warden at a jail,

186
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,522
and we're the new meat.

187
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,067
Seriously, I will just go
and move in with Carrie, okay?

188
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,193
Her parents will adopt me.

189
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,736
You'd leave me here alone?

190
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,739
Well, no. I would visit you on Sundays.

191
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,950
Okay, you know what?
You're going nowhere without me, all right?

192
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,828
I am taking the keys, all right?

193
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,913
Seriously, it's not funny.

194
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,498
- Nora!
- You need to come right now.

195
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,208
- Nora...
- Stop being so immature.

196
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,418
Nora!

197
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,461
- Don't leave me.
- Come on.

198
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,296
What do you think?

199
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,843
Fifteen minutes,
and you are on the other side of the border.

200
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,762
My God.

201
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,307
Hasn't changed in 10 years, no?

202
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,810
I can't thank you enough.

203
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,270
No, no, no, no, no.

204
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,990
Sorry, I don't...

205
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,159
They don't speak Spanish.

206
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,787
Is she planning living in there, o que?

207
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,888
That's my stuff.

208
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,833
Yo, yo, relax.

209
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,668
I ain't the barrio killer.

210
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,921
Are you homeless?

211
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,840
No. Are you?

212
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,970
Shit, I need mace.

213
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,724
Look who's here.

214
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,021
There is a gang member on your lawn.

215
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,982
No, mija, that's Bruno, my neighbor.

216
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,236
Okay, well, he's creepy.

217
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,531
Not everything that stinks is caca, mijita.

218
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,044
- Go home. Okay?
- Hurry up, before they charge you. Go.

219
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,299
- She is Nora.
- Hi.

220
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,886
Yo, you're good.
We got your back out here, all right?

221
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,054
All right.

222
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,307
And the other one with no smile is la Mary.

223
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,896
Nice to meet you, Mary.

224
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,024
It's Mary. And I'm not tipping you.

225
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,278
That's good, 'cause I don't take IOUs.

226
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,079
Go ahead, go ahead. Sit down.

227
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,542
We have wonderful and delicious
churros y chocolates.

228
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:38,301
This neighborhood used to be Jewish,
then Japanese, then Mexican.

229
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,262
It's totally Calcutta.

230
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,434
Except it's less hot, and there's a breeze.

231
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,104
- We gotta get out of here.
- And go where?

232
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,398
Four Seasons.

233
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,777
You know what?
There's lice on that mattress.

234
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,946
Then you won't sleep alone.

235
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,658
Why don't you get ready for bed?

236
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,542
Nora, I miss Dad.

237
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,133
Me, too.

238
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,262
That stupid mustache.

239
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,016
It wasn't even original.

240
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,186
It was that Pedro guy.

241
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,271
Infante.

242
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,649
Yeah, Pedro Infante.

243
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,029
But Mom looked more
like that Dolores River lady.

244
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,198
- River lady?
- I don't know her name.

245
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,660
It was del Rio or something.

246
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,120
Yeah. You know what?

247
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,000
She would have looked like
anything Dad wanted her to.

248
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,546
I really miss him, Nora.

249
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,391
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say "sorry."

250
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,310
Don't say "sorry."

251
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,603
What are we gonna do?

252
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,606
We're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna figure it out.

253
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,986
Oh, my gosh.

254
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,823
It's not a dream? Shit!

255
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,828
Careful. Last two eggs.

256
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,267
How is it possible
that you don't know the basics?

257
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,227
Do you know how to fly a plane?

258
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,897
Of course not. Why should I?

259
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,693
Right. Well, because you never had to.
I never had to cook.

260
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,362
I'm willing to learn.

261
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,365
Learn to clean.

262
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,243
And then we go out for a little desayuno.

263
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,871
Not downtown, Carrie.

264
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,248
No, it's worse. East LA.

265
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,917
Will you just get a map, please?

266
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,753
Gosh, you'd think we moved
to another country.

267
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,639
Learning Spanish?

268
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:58,370
This is the neighborhood.
And don't worry, they speak English here.

269
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,549
Nice to meet you. I'm Rosita.

270
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,052
You need some work.

271
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,596
Come on in. I have two-for-one special.

272
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,016
What was that?

273
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,653
What is that?

274
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,992
Ay, mija, you better make friends
a new way, hombre.

275
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:41,288
What? Just a few minutes at Macy's
makeup counter and they'd be fine.

276
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,301
Excuse me, but do you know
how much fat is in this?

277
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,978
What's the matter with you?

278
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,898
You are just like your mother.

279
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,484
Of course. She was smart.

280
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,777
No, mijita.

281
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,368
And what does she do?

282
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,078
Crash in the car.

283
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,458
Don't worry, tia,
we're going to be responsible. You'll see.

284
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,921
I'm going to get a job at a law firm
and Mary's going to graduate.

285
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,340
You're gonna quit school?

286
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,134
Nora, I'm the one who sucks at school.

287
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,678
I'm going to defer school,
and you need to finish.

288
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,222
- Then, I'll go back.
- Don't worry, Mary.

289
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,184
Nora's not the only one
who's going to have to make sacrifices.

290
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,729
It will take you to the same places.

291
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,399
Where they will turn me away.

292
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,883
What is he doing here?

293
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,931
Nora? That Edward guy is here.

294
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,479
Hey, yo.

295
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,108
- Yeah?
- You parked the wrong way.

296
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,403
Sorry.

297
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,880
Yes?

298
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,677
Hi. The Dominguez family?

299
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,263
- Are you from police?
- No.

300
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,306
No, no, no. I'm Edward Ferris.

301
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,642
I'm looking for Nora Dominguez.

302
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,646
I will ask her if she's here.

303
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,576
Come in, please.

304
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,996
Thank you.

305
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,040
Wait, please.

306
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,426
It's time for Dodger baseball.

307
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,513
Live from PETCO Park in San Diego,

308
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,892
Prime Ticket presents the Dodgers

309
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,561
- and the San Diego Padres.
- Hi.

310
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,688
Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant...

311
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,899
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

312
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,527
What are you doing here?

313
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,987
Come with me.

314
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,290
That's my dad.

315
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,504
Thank you.

316
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,922
You're welcome.

317
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,849
- That's... Be careful. It's really heavy.
- Thank you.

318
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,610
- Careful, please. It's my sister.
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

319
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,404
- I think it's okay.
- Thank you.

320
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,741
No offense,

321
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,994
but why are you doing all of this?

322
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,038
We can do nice things for each other,
can't we?

323
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,581
Well, yeah, but...

324
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,961
Renting a U-Haul
and picking up all of our stuff

325
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,922
and driving it to the ghetto
is a bit much, don't you think?

326
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,591
Don't forget convincing my sister
to give it all back to you.

327
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,264
Well, you just don't really seem
like the kind of guy who does stuff for free.

328
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,600
On a professional level, never.

329
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,729
And what level are we, Edward?

330
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,663
Someone must have been watering
his mustache 'cause it's a lot bigger.

331
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,668
You seem to have adapted well
in such a short period of time.

332
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,713
I'm a cockroach.

333
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,215
Survival skills.

334
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,843
- I adapt.
- Okay.

335
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,304
So, what else do you have to do to survive?

336
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,514
- Find a job.
- You're looking for a job?

337
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,934
There is an opening in our office.

338
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,936
We could stand a cockroach or two.

339
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,273
Thank you.

340
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,861
But you've been nice enough already,
and I will find one by myself.

341
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,281
- Like through the classifieds?
- For example.

342
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,419
Be my guest. And good luck.

343
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,838
Thank you.

344
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,973
"Dentist.

345
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,559
"Dance hostess."

346
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,481
Do you think this is what Mexico looks like?

347
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,275
Here's one.

348
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,488
"Samuels, Birnbaum & Tate."

349
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,867
Corporate law. Perfect. I'll apply tomorrow.

350
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,704
There's something weird
about that Edward guy, don't you think?

351
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,877
Well, he seems nicer than his sister,
and he offered me a job.

352
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,463
He did?

353
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,549
Well, did you accept?

354
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,179
No. I can find a job on my own.

355
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,598
Nora, in the real world,
it's called hitting on you.

356
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,643
And what does that mean, really?

357
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,979
He likes you.

358
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,232
I mean, why else would
he be doing all this stuff?

359
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,235
I'm sorry.
You're not interested in relationships,

360
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,362
only your 1 0-year plan, 'cause you're weird.

361
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,282
Well, whatever you think, I'm not like you.

362
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,580
I can't believe Dad wrote all these letters
and Gabe never got them.

363
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,416
I'm gonna open these and read them.

364
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,917
No, you're not.

365
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,253
- No, no, no, you're not.
- Come on.

366
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,504
No, Mary.

367
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,089
One day, we're gonna give them to Gabe.

368
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,632
Yeah, in our next life.

369
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,825
- Bye.
- Have a good day.

370
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,909
Thank you. You, too.

371
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,286
- Bye.
- Bye.

372
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,913
Oh, God. Look at this car.

373
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,138
Are you serious?

374
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,182
What are you looking for?

375
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,142
Great bargain, tia.

376
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,977
Thank you.

377
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,772
Hey, yo. Yo!

378
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,190
Stop, stop.

379
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,108
Stop.

380
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,904
- You're gonna drown it.
- Okay.

381
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,661
Don't steal anything.

382
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,789
- You think all Mexicans steal?
- I don't know.

383
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,956
I'm not Mexican.

384
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,876
You're not Mexican?
You should take a look at yourself

385
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
in your new mirror.

386
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,714
Because with a poncho and huaraches,
you can make a killing selling tamales.

387
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,550
That's really funny.

388
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,929
- Hey, you know what a distributor is?
- Do I need to?

389
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,224
See, these two cables here,
they come loose.

390
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,352
- Yeah?
- Just make sure that they still connect.

391
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,355
Like your mouth and your brain should.

392
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,986
Thanks. Can you do the garden next?

393
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,533
Right after I finish
cleaning your indoor pool.

394
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,458
Mary, slow down.

395
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,294
You don't wanna be late for work.
Here's your bus.

396
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,755
Don't sit in the back. You will get killed.

397
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,757
By who? A commuter?

398
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,218
Goodbye, Nora.

399
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,345
Goodbye, Mary. Have a good day.

400
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,931
...is right.

401
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,811
We have joined the working class. Lame!

402
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,904
Thank you.

403
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,159
Sorry.

404
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,005
You live in LA and not speak Spanish?

405
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,762
Is she okay?

406
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,019
I fired.

407
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,771
Big boss no pay because of mops.

408
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,648
Because of mops?

409
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,194
I borrow to clean hall for quinceanera.

410
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,030
The quinceanera party, you know?

411
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,326
Then you should have
been given a warning.

412
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,871
I'm a law student, if that helps at all.

413
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,665
Can you help us?

414
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,584
I can try.

415
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,088
Really?

416
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,299
Thank you.

417
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,152
Welcome to Samuels, Birnbaum & Tate.

418
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,488
Hi, I'm Nora Dominguez.

419
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,783
Congratulations.

420
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,661
You made it to the 26th floor quite quickly.

421
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,497
I just used the elevator.

422
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,791
Is that what they call it these days?

423
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,842
He specializes in corporate defense
of product liability.

424
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,803
Your password is "Ferris."

425
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,680
- Ferris?
- Yes, Ferris.

426
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,806
Like Edward, your new boss.

427
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,267
Read the deposition, write a little brief,

428
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,227
tell him about how he's gonna make
a lot of money this year,

429
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,353
you'll do just fine. Got it?

430
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,188
See you in 10 years.

431
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,475
Today, a great deal of political turmoil.

432
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,103
How many of you
have read the book I assigned?

433
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,023
- Did you read the book?
- The title page.

434
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,357
Just as I thought.

435
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,778
This is why today,
I brought in my new TA, Rodrigo.

436
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,865
You notice how TAs always
look like star political prisoners?

437
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,285
...La Casa De Bernarda Alba.
Rodrigo, please.

438
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,377
Don't worry, that's all the Spanish I'll speak.

439
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,421
What happened to political prisoner?

440
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,839
"Silence!

441
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,342
"Silence."

442
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,972
Those are the first words you hear
in Garcia Lorca's masterpiece.

443
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,684
- Who is he?
- A story about the consequences of...

444
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,772
I heard his father is an ambassador
to one of those countries with fruit flies.

445
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,649
I trust you have experienced
the electricity of desire.

446
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,946
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- Does it matter?

447
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,073
- No.
- Are you one of those people

448
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,658
who burns with so much passion,

449
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,787
but are not able to express it?

450
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,916
Then you might be able to relate
to this tragedy of a mother

451
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,919
who locks up her five daughters

452
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,588
to mourn their deceased father
for eight years.

453
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,259
Can you imagine losing a father
and mourning him for that long?

454
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,303
- Yes.
- What?

455
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,598
Now, imagine a free spirit

456
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,978
burning in desire for a man,
Pepe el Romano,

457
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,316
who climbs through your window
each night,

458
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,193
but cannot belong to you.

459
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:09,656
And when he calls to you in the distance,
he sings your very name.

460
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,160
Adela!

461
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,415
Mary.

462
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,794
And do you know how she responds?

463
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,549
- Then, my friends, you must read...
- Don't do that to me.

464
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,969
I look forward to reading your papers.

465
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,055
You'll never get him.

466
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,181
Watch me.

467
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,729
So, you haven't...

468
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,525
Hi. Will you do
that Pepe el Romano thing, again?

469
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,360
So, you listened?

470
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,778
Every word.

471
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,740
So, you're Mexican, too?

472
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,535
No, my parents.

473
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,579
Okay.

474
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,706
And what are you?

475
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,375
American, of course.

476
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,211
Well, and Mexican. So, Mexican-American.

477
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,715
American-Mexican.
My dad was more Mexican.

478
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,010
Tell me more about you.

479
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,721
Well, I like the color red,

480
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,059
my iPod is full, I don't wake up before 10:00,
and no hablo espanol.

481
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,938
I love poetry, pasta, and Prada.

482
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,357
You?

483
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,028
Wow, unfortunately,
I cannot list like you just did.

484
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,866
That's very American.
But we like to sit down, drink a nice tequila,

485
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:39,204
and tell each other details
until they make a full story, so to speak.

486
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,456
It takes hours.

487
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,210
Well, I think I can make that time.

488
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,420
So, it's a date?

489
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,882
See the house right up there?

490
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,763
Wow!

491
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,349
- You have a very nice house.
- Don't I?

492
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,851
Thank you so much for the ride.

493
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,770
No, no, no. Don't get out, please.

494
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,772
What... You're sure?

495
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:10,527
Yeah. Really, I'm fine. No, no, no. No.

496
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,738
You can go. Thank you so much for the ride.

497
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,281
- Okay.
- Thanks.

498
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,951
- Bye.
- I'll see you.

499
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,345
- You're studying?
- I have to.

500
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,681
The TA's my future husband.

501
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,432
- The TA?
- Yeah.

502
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:46,437
Oh, my gosh, he's so hot, and he's cultured,
and I can tell he comes from money.

503
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,151
How was your first day at work?

504
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,530
Surprising. Guess who's my boss?

505
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,157
- Who?
- Edward.

506
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,412
How did he get you?

507
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,833
Well, there's only one intern job offered
in the newspaper, and obviously he knew it.

508
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,460
Did he slip you some tongue?

509
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:13,673
Mary, people don't go around the office
slipping some tongue, okay?

510
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,258
But it was still weird.

511
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,428
I don't know, I just never thought
that working would be like that.

512
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,929
Like how?

513
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,349
All those people are really uptight
and stare at you funny.

514
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,102
Guess they're just unhappy.

515
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,231
See, that's why I'm never gonna do it.

516
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,279
So, mops are...

517
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,197
- Trapeadores.
- ...trapeadores.

518
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,199
- Yeah.
- Okay. And when was this?

519
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,784
Two weeks ago.

520
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,581
You know, I think I have a really good case
for the law firm.

521
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,883
Hey, bitch!

522
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,177
What'd you say about my face?

523
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,807
I just said that I liked your eyeliner.

524
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,729
Hey, yo. We good, ladies?

525
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,731
Yeah, Bruno.

526
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,900
Catch you later, white girl.

527
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,820
I'm Mexican.

528
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,618
Thank you.

529
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,623
Sorry, sorry.

530
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,134
Hi. It's nice to see you.

531
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:44,097
Have you found anything interesting
in those depositions yet?

532
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,139
Not yet.

533
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,851
But I did meet a lady on the bus
with an interesting case.

534
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,020
You rode the bus?

535
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,772
Good place to find clients.

536
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,899
That don't pay.

537
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,859
That's why we have pro bono.

538
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,779
Yeah. Well, you want to know
what the problem with pro bono is?

539
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,239
You can't charge.

540
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,786
Yeah.

541
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,457
In the conference room?
A bunch of cleaning ladies?

542
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,460
They're my clients.
That's what I came to tell you.

543
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,170
I need your help.

544
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,299
It's fine. They're clients.

545
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,386
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

546
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,145
You speak Spanish?

547
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,272
Of course. I grew up in LA.

548
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:41,487
These women, all janitors,
were fired from their company

549
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:46,159
the day before they qualified for benefits,
for taking mops.

550
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,663
Mops?

551
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,670
I think Lorca was a great poet.

552
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,547
Me, too.

553
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,300
There's a poem that my nanny
used to tell me in Spanish,

554
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,760
when she would put me to sleep.

555
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,304
"The houses reveal faces

556
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,639
"And the grasses, poppies, and vines dance

557
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,726
"To the sound of the breeze from the sun"

558
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,437
I love it.

559
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,814
I still dream about that house.

560
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,318
I dream about a house, too.

561
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,028
Really? You do?

562
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,488
Yes.

563
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,950
It's... It's really Californian.

564
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,580
And it's surrounded
by these big, blue-eyed jacarandas.

565
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,876
And there's a Spanish fountain,
and it's wrapped in this tile,

566
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,170
and it sings night and day.

567
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,173
And there are these oranges
that ooze this sweet nectar...

568
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,927
Wait, wait, wait.
I must taste them to see how sweet it is.

569
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:03,277
California is so decadent.

570
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,363
I'm gonna buy a house here.

571
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,656
You are?

572
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,450
You should buy the house
I was telling you about.

573
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,161
- Which one?
- My house. It's for sale.

574
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,623
What do you mean? The house
where I've been dropping you off?

575
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,544
No, because that's my new house.

576
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,881
The house that I was telling you about
is my old house,

577
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,634
and it's amazing.

578
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,760
Love to see it.

579
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,428
Will you show it to me?

580
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,430
Yeah.

581
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:40,356
Why is it taking so long
to gut this ugly room?

582
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,568
Sorry, ma'am. It will be done tonight.

583
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,570
That is the downside of construction.

584
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:49,031
Have you ever met lazier people
in your entire life?

585
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,701
Clearly, there is no leadership here.

586
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,746
Chop-chop! Could you turn off the radio?
It sounds like a taco truck in here.

587
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,123
Wouldn't you agree, Lucy?

588
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,374
Olivia...

589
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:04,714
I think if you were nicer to them,
they might work faster for you, no?

590
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,384
If I'm gonna make you my sister-in-law,
you need to know

591
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,555
that there is a fine line
between niceness and weakness.

592
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,807
And I never cross it.

593
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,152
Gabe?

594
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,821
What happened to you?

595
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,076
Will you stop obsessing about your father
and help me out here?

596
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,353
What?

597
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,688
You know all the words.

598
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,691
Yeah. I just don't know what they mean.

599
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,696
"Singing lightens the heart, my little sky."

600
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,199
Wow.

601
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,534
You're becoming quite the little diccionario.

602
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:20,331
But "cielito lindo"
doesn't actually mean "little sky."

603
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:26,212
It means something more endearing,
like "sweetheart" or "darling."

604
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,883
Yeah.

605
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,261
I seriously need to learn Spanish.

606
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:38,391
I mean, I'm really finding Mexican culture,
like, intoxicating.

607
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,643
No.

608
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,520
Wait, do you remember the TA
I was telling you about?

609
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,022
- Yes.
- He is so Mexican.

610
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,316
Dad would have loved him.

611
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,902
Yeah, he's gonna buy a house in LA.

612
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,362
Okay.

613
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,407
Our house.

614
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,866
Your house?

615
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,576
Does he know this yet?

616
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,078
Not yet.

617
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,581
And when are you planning on telling him?

618
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,126
Our engagement.

619
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,044
Okay.

620
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,383
Are you serious?

621
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,636
My service was just discontinued.

622
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,431
Well, you better get engaged soon then.

623
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,154
Honestly, I don't think we have a case.

624
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,365
We know that they fired you
to get out of benefit obligations.

625
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,286
But these depositions,
they don't offer any legal proof.

626
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,663
I mean, basically,
it's your word against theirs.

627
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,708
And they are going to be ruthless.

628
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,294
There must be a way to fight them.

629
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,795
Well, you can't win on the mops.

630
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,883
But, I mean, in theory,
if you had something on them,

631
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,969
you could compel them
to reinstate the workers.

632
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,472
Do you mean like cleaning asbestos?

633
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,725
Or getting demoted for getting pregnant?

634
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,145
Or cheating time cards to pay us less?

635
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:11,650
Yes. Yeah, those would certainly all qualify.

636
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,653
But can you prove it?

637
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,450
Wait, Edward,
what about third party evidence?

638
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,118
I don't follow.

639
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,828
Let me explain.

640
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,580
Marco Antonio, do you have the time cards?

641
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,040
Yes. Okay.

642
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,584
We can prove they are committing fraud.

643
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,962
I commute with these janitors every day.

644
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,840
Every day on the same bus.

645
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,343
- Here they are.
- Thank you.

646
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,392
What's this?

647
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,105
This is good.

648
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,981
Day of what?

649
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,358
Screaming.

650
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,902
History, Mary.

651
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,364
Independence day, hombre.

652
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,241
It's a big party, mija.

653
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,787
If you want, I can make you a blouse.

654
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,540
Actually, can you make this?

655
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,959
It'll look so hot, but shorter. Like, look.

656
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,096
Do you have boyfriends?

657
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,056
Me, always. She, never.

658
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,767
No boyfriend, why?

659
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,186
Tia, I just don't have the time.

660
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,647
Work and no fun.

661
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,485
You, invite your boyfriend.

662
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,988
This is an important family party.

663
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,285
Do we embarrass you?

664
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,168
The first quality of your father,
he had so few,

665
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,255
is that he had huevos.

666
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:01,510
He was valiante
and always proud of his family.

667
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:29,705
So, like, do you ever get paid,
or do you just get off on working for free?

668
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,292
Wow, is that a new word
you just learned? "Work"?

669
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,338
Well, see, I would do it
if it didn't involve labor.

670
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,091
What are you doing?

671
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,802
Magic.

672
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,266
With this. Nice. It's junk.

673
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:54,563
See, the thing is, princess, is that
you can hate this for what you think it is

674
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,234
or you can love it
for what you know it can become.

675
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,654
Wow. Sounds like you're building a mission,
Father Bruno.

676
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,323
- Okay.
- We need a party, not a chapel.

677
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,161
Hey, you know where Birds of Paradise is?

678
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,413
A metaphor?

679
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,207
A flower.

680
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,335
They're for decorations.
Can you get some of those for me?

681
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:21,006
They're the ones
that look like Birds of Paradise.

682
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,514
Seriously, not gonna help.

683
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,184
Wanna bet?

684
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,647
Yeah, actually. Name it.

685
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,400
I will make the party beautiful,

686
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,652
and you give me a dance.

687
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,281
All right, you got it, my man.

688
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,617
I'm late for my manicure.

689
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,044
My client is not reinstating these employees.

690
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,421
- He's not?
- No, counselor.

691
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,381
They have stolen my client's property.

692
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,217
Let's talk about that for a moment. Stealing.

693
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,303
We believe that we have
a fraud case against you

694
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,929
for stealing from these employees.

695
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,389
Hardly.

696
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,392
Come on,
they're lucky I haven't called the INS.

697
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,482
These pay stubs show that
you've been paying them seven hours a day.

698
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,444
We have paid them
for what they have worked.

699
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:28,657
As you can see, these time cards
are punched in for eight hours or more.

700
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,536
Where did you get those?

701
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,665
This is Maria Ramirez.
She does your payroll.

702
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,586
I don't know if you knew that her niece,
Rosalita Ramirez, is a janitor at your firm.

703
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,881
Maria called her brother,
Marco Antonio Ramirez,

704
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,592
who just so happens
to supervise your time card machine.

705
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,053
His wife, Angelica Ramirez,
is right over there.

706
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,387
She works for you, too.

707
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,765
No, no, no, wait.
She is my cousin Esperanza.

708
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,974
That is my wife.

709
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,312
Sorry about that. What's important
is that I have all their depositions.

710
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,774
In short, sir,

711
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,027
you call the INS, we'll call the IRS.

712
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,074
- Let's go.
- This is a joke.

713
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,785
You've won.

714
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,758
Thank you. That was amazing.

715
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,176
We should celebrate.

716
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,012
Actually, there is a party at my aunt's.

717
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,515
It's a Mexican holiday where we scream.

718
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,851
The janitors will be there
and the neighbors and their families,

719
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,478
if you dare to come.

720
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,231
I have been to your hood before,
so I think I can risk it.

721
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,483
That's pretty bold for an outsider.

722
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,985
It's amazing the things
that one does for love...

723
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,612
Of public good.

724
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,906
Well, we'll be waiting for you.

725
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,492
And I wouldn't let those janitors down.

726
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,827
I won't.

727
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,248
You okay?

728
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,500
I'm fine.

729
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,794
That's it.

730
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,300
Wow.

731
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,306
Who lives here?

732
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,184
Me.

733
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,273
It's actually kind of funny.

734
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,402
The house that
you have been dropping me off at,

735
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,904
I don't even know who lives there.

736
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,957
Look, when my dad died, we lost everything.

737
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,959
Even the house that we grew up in.

738
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,045
And I lied to you because I really like you.

739
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,052
Sorry.

740
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,348
This is where I live now.

741
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,686
Yeah, you can go if you want.

742
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,912
Don't look, but they're totally
checking us out in the window.

743
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,164
So be prepared for some,

744
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,750
"Mary, look,
you brought a friend from school,"

745
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,794
even though they totally
already know who you are.

746
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,263
Mary, a friend from school?

747
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,609
I have no idea what just happened,
and I'm really sorry.

748
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,242
Wow, this is cool.

749
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,868
How beautiful.

750
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,371
Come on, let's dance.

751
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,753
Okay, give me back my boyfriend.
Thank you.

752
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:04,725
You look beautiful.

753
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,895
You look very, very beautiful.

754
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,541
You have to teach me how to salsa.

755
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,560
Okay, okay.
You can have him, but for five minutes only.

756
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,645
Only five minutes.

757
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,482
- Take care of him.
- Okay, okay, okay.

758
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,367
Hey, you shouldn't waste the state's flower.
We're in a drought.

759
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:09,581
So, you clean up all right.
You know, for a homeboy, you look good.

760
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,086
I'm not gonna lie.
This place looks really, really great.

761
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,212
You did a good job.

762
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,256
So, I lost the bet,
and I want to be good on my part.

763
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,716
Let's have that dance.

764
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,718
After you, sir.

765
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,724
You ain't got to worry about it.

766
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,268
You didn't lose.

767
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:36,942
I did.

768
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,951
Sorry.

769
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,125
- Edward. Hi.
- Hi.

770
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,418
Hi.

771
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,463
Wow, you look like Frida Kahlo.

772
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,632
Thank you.

773
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,969
Yeah, the Salma Hayek version,
without the moustache either.

774
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,387
- Okay.
- Okay.

775
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,389
Jeez, your aunt throws a kicking party.

776
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,349
I gotta make it
to this side of town more often.

777
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,976
I love it here.

778
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,644
You'd stay if you had the choice?

779
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,439
Yes, I would.

780
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,569
Where would you go if you had the choice?

781
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,530
Right across the street.

782
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:24,990
Yeah, right.

783
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,242
Where is Nora Dominguez?

784
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,955
Nora Dominguez is
at the bottom of Mr. Tequila.

785
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:36,418
Wow. Well, to celebrate
and, you know, to get me caught up.

786
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,962
- Okay, perfect.
- Great.

787
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,677
You were fantastic yesterday.

788
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,305
Thanks. Yeah, to tell you the truth,
I surprised myself.

789
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,974
I go to court to deal with conglomerates,
never people.

790
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,560
Yeah, but people bring out the best in you.

791
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,730
You galvanized those janitors.

792
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,690
You were so charismatic.

793
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,817
- I was?
- Yes.

794
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,864
Yes, you were. Like a general

795
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:09,409
- leading his troops.
- Wow.

796
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,369
And when you slammed those cards
on the table...

797
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,289
- Yes?
- I wanted to...

798
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,542
- Yeah?
- I wanted to...

799
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,461
You know what, Edward?

800
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,839
I don't really know what I wanted to do,

801
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,342
but I have to tell you,

802
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,887
I've never met someone

803
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,517
so... So...

804
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,370
I just came in for a fork.

805
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,629
- What just happened?
- We kissed.

806
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,215
We?

807
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,259
Yeah, you kissed me, too.

808
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:12,514
Oh, dear. I shouldn't have done that.

809
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,434
- Why not?
- This isn't me.

810
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,603
No, no, no, this is you.

811
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,438
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

812
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:24,734
I... I'm a lawyer.
I mean, I wanna be a good lawyer

813
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:29,364
and set up, you know,
a community service and a legal practice.

814
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,616
- Yeah, well, you...
- And I have my 1 0-year plan.

815
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,119
You can do all that with me.
We'd make a great team.

816
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,872
- You're my boss.
- Okay, I'll fire you then.

817
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,332
You're not taking me seriously.

818
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,712
You know, I need to maintain
100 % focus on my work,

819
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,214
and that's all I want,
and that's all I have room for.

820
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,633
You can't tell me
that you didn't feel something, too.

821
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,176
That's not the point.

822
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,345
Nora, stop arguing a case.

823
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,223
Please...

824
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,476
I'm falling for you.

825
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,689
You don't know me.

826
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,527
And as far as I can tell,

827
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,782
I'm just another girl
who answered your ad in the newspaper.

828
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,749
Well, then,

829
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,462
I guess it's time to place a new one then.

830
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,045
Having a party of your own?

831
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,887
Is there something wrong with me?

832
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,265
No.

833
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:41,246
You know, sometimes you play a game

834
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,710
even when you know you're gonna lose.

835
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,758
Or sometimes,

836
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,889
you leave a game
even when you know you can win.

837
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,107
I wouldn't leave that game.

838
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,075
The remodel is actually much bigger
than we planned.

839
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,953
I'm finally getting to use my design skills.

840
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,998
Edward, what a surprise.
I didn't think you'd come.

841
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,295
God, you look like
you just came from a funeral.

842
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,965
I lost a case today.

843
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,135
Well, you win some, you lose some.

844
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,846
Yeah, this one I really wanted to win.

845
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:44,893
Well, stop being a buzzkill
and meet my friend Lucy.

846
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:31,773
Shit.

847
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,519
What happened to my desk?

848
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,229
He didn't tell you about the transfer?

849
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,939
What transfer?

850
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,610
Yours. But don't fret, it's a promotion.

851
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,322
Bigger salary, more benefits, good luck.

852
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,242
Go to Tower B, 30th floor.

853
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,247
Maybe now we can get back to work?

854
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,134
Well, then I quit.

855
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,605
I need to tell you something.

856
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,732
Yeah?

857
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,028
I have to go to Mexico for a while
to see my family.

858
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,282
Well, for how long?

859
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,075
A couple of weeks.

860
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,452
Maybe three.

861
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,329
- Really?
- Yeah.

862
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,291
Well, I miss you already.

863
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,295
Me, too.

864
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,806
Bye.

865
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,021
Hey. What?

866
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,363
What do you know about this guy?

867
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,407
He's a gentleman.
Oh, my gosh, Nora, I'm in love.

868
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,826
And I'm moving out in two weeks.

869
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,995
Has he told you he loves you?

870
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,164
Okay, seriously, you just don't get it.

871
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,251
He's strong and silent, okay? I just know.

872
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,670
You know what?

873
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,173
Remember, two-for-one?

874
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,633
Thanks.

875
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,552
- Mary, you just met him.
- So?

876
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,721
That's not love.

877
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,474
Okay, how do you know what love is?

878
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,850
What's wrong with you?

879
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,311
What do you want from him?

880
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,272
I want to go back to Beverly Hills, Nora.

881
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,525
Okay, there, I said it. It's all I want. Okay?

882
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,528
It's all I've wanted since we got here,
and he can give that to me.

883
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:28,199
He's cute, he's sexy,
and he has lots of money.

884
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,494
He loves taking care of things. Why not me?

885
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,081
It's the oldest story in the book.
Does that make me such a bad person?

886
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,543
It makes you a whore.

887
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,173
Better than the spinster.

888
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,176
My gosh! That's our house!

889
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,327
I made chicken soup.

890
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,581
- Is something wrong?
- No.

891
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:11,881
Well, obviously something is going on,
so why don't you tell me what's going on?

892
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,097
This came by mail.

893
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,768
- What is it?
- An invitation.

894
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,104
To Edward's engagement party.

895
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:42,912
Finally.

896
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:45,957
You knew?

897
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,503
Yeah, yeah.

898
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,173
Can we eat?

899
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,931
Do you like aguacate, Mary?

900
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,851
No. Actually, no. This is perfect. Thanks.

901
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,814
You know, the best for the chicken soup
is aguacate...

902
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,775
Mary.

903
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,875
Hey.

904
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,466
You have to tell him.

905
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,055
It's too late.

906
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:27,558
If he announces an engagement that quick,

907
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,187
it just means that he is way more confused
than you are.

908
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:35,775
What can I do?

909
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,653
Just tell him.

910
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:44,533
Just tell him how you feel,
or else you're gonna end up regretting it.

911
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,078
Okay? What Olivia doesn't know

912
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,623
is that she has just given you
a wonderful opportunity.

913
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,253
I don't think I can.

914
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:01,967
Well,

915
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,846
I'm going with you.

916
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,268
That scares me even more.

917
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,479
Shut up.

918
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,053
Are you serious? Gosh! You look like a nun.

919
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,805
- Nora, this is war.
- What?

920
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,473
What? What's wrong with it?

921
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,434
You look so hot.

922
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,936
I can't walk. These are way too high.

923
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:56,147
Okay, turn around. Spin.

924
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,648
He's gonna love this.

925
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,984
What? What are you doing?

926
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,653
- I might as well be naked.
- Are you serious?

927
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,488
Stop. Okay. Come on.

928
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,993
- Still too tight.
- Stand up straight.

929
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,162
- What? No.
- You look beautiful.

930
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,830
No. You look beautiful.

931
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:21,464
I don't know. What?

932
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,142
Baby.

933
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,060
You look so beautiful.

934
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,775
You look so tall with these shoes,
it goes like...

935
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,399
Is this the right house?

936
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:24,985
Yeah, it is.

937
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:28,572
What happened to our house?

938
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:34,495
It's like a supermax prison
with Christmas lights.

939
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,540
So gray.

940
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:43,212
- Is that Juanito?
- Yeah. Look at their uniforms.

941
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,799
Hi!

942
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,260
What do you think of my new ride?

943
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,514
Juanito. Look what I brought you.

944
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,225
- For old times' sake, huh?
- Thank you.

945
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,602
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

946
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,229
- Good.
- Hi, bonita.

947
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,025
What a surprise!

948
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,116
- You look so nice.
- You, too, Carmina.

949
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,499
They walled in the view.

950
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,127
For this ugly painting.

951
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,340
Our house is gone forever.

952
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,304
Come on.

953
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,068
Who invited them?

954
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,155
Gabe insisted. I can't believe they came.

955
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:56,118
Well, at the very least,
they get to experience my remodel.

956
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,663
Who are they?

957
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:01,790
Hi.

958
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:06,128
We were pretty surprised
to receive your invitation,

959
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,005
but we're really happy to be here.

960
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,673
Late, as per usual.

961
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:12,259
Yeah, well, I'm Mexican, you know.

962
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:18,515
Let me introduce you to Edward's intended,
Lucy Parker.

963
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:22,519
This is Mary and Nora Dominguez,
members of my family.

964
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,397
- Good evening.
- You're a very lucky woman.

965
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,691
Thank you.

966
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,027
- He's a great guy.
- How would you know?

967
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,862
I would know.

968
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,456
Gabe, can I talk to you for a minute
in private?

969
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:43,749
More family secrets?

970
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,085
- Yes, Olivia.
- I don't think so.

971
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,883
She says she loves your remodeling.

972
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,595
Yeah. I would... Happy to...

973
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:01,016
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you for coming.

974
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,566
Need some martinis.

975
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,871
So, what do you really think
about the house?

976
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,874
Well, it looks like MTV Cribs,

977
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,503
but I'm really happy
that you kept Dad's office.

978
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:34,008
Yeah, well.
I had to fight Olivia for it, but it was worth it.

979
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,762
It's the only thing I have left of him.

980
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,815
Actually, it's not.

981
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:43,911
Nora?

982
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,876
Mary forced me to come,

983
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,215
and now I'm here in front of you,

984
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,385
without words, which is crazy

985
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,888
because I always know what to say.

986
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,225
And I'm kind of having
this whole second-guessing game

987
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:07,851
going through my head right now,

988
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:11,146
and I kind of want to dig a hole right there

989
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:13,524
- and kind ofjust...
- Nora.

990
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:16,985
Why here?

991
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,580
When you kissed me that night,

992
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,960
I had never felt those emotions before.

993
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:39,383
I avoid relationships
because I can't count on them.

994
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,220
First my mother's death,
and then my father's.

995
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,727
I've built my whole life

996
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:55,816
counting on the one thing I can control,
which is my career.

997
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,904
And then you came along.

998
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:10,873
I resisted you

999
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,251
not for lack of love,

1000
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,590
but because I was afraid
of losing myself in it.

1001
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:30,809
Edward?

1002
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:36,773
- They want to see you in there.
- Yeah. Yes, I will be right there.

1003
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:45,657
- Edward. I really need you.
- Yeah. I'm coming.

1004
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,246
Edward.

1005
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,019
Thanks.

1006
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:26,657
Rodrigo?

1007
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,701
Hey, Mary.

1008
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,413
What a surprise to see you here.

1009
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:36,667
I thought you were in Mexico.

1010
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:40,170
Yeah. Yeah, I was. I just came back.

1011
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:46,218
I want you to meet Natalia, my wife.

1012
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:51,348
Mary was by far my best student this year.

1013
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,184
- Right?
- Nice to meet you.

1014
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:58,605
You should come to dinner
when we settle into the house.

1015
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,773
Yeah.

1016
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:04,278
- You bought this house?
- Yeah. He seduced me with it.

1017
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,696
I used to hate LA,

1018
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,532
and now I love this house.

1019
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,829
Hey. Good to see you again.

1020
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,219
Mary!

1021
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,638
Mary! Mary!

1022
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:57,873
Come on!

1023
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:04,880
Why?

1024
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:07,549
No!

1025
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,095
Stupid!

1026
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:55,013
Start!

1027
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,061
How is she?

1028
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,689
We're still waiting for an update.

1029
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,943
I'm glad you're here.

1030
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,863
- We're family, aren't we?
- Yeah.

1031
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,992
How is...

1032
01:30:57,493 --> 01:30:59,286
- Olivia.
- Yeah. Right.

1033
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:00,829
We split up.

1034
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,250
I'm sorry.

1035
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,377
Why?

1036
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,690
Enough. We have to try everything.

1037
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,030
What are you doing?

1038
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:38,867
- I don't think that's right.
- Mary. Mary, wake up!

1039
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:45,207
What?

1040
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,543
Mary. Mary!

1041
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,421
Wake up before they kill you.

1042
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:56,968
What are you doing?

1043
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,771
- Stop.
- I want to...

1044
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,319
- Fast?
- Yeah.

1045
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:26,998
Hi.

1046
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,796
Please don't drop me. Seriously.

1047
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,142
Is that Bruno's new project?

1048
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:48,979
He did it overnight for you especially.

1049
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,273
He didn't come visit me in the hospital.

1050
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,157
You okay?

1051
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,744
Remember when we first got here?

1052
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,539
I seriously thought I was gonna die.

1053
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,457
You almost did.

1054
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,796
I was really selfish.

1055
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:23,054
You were just in love
with someone who didn't love you.

1056
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:25,724
You knew?

1057
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:31,855
I didn't realize I was in love
with someone who did.

1058
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:38,069
You know, it's really hard
to drink with a neck brace.

1059
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:47,514
It's like a community's photo album.
All right?

1060
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:52,852
Every picture we paint
tells our stories. Right?

1061
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:57,607
Every muralist has a mentor.
My mentor was Judy Barker.

1062
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,610
Now, she taught me to use our barrio's walls

1063
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:01,945
as a canvas to
tell your story and your story...

1064
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,282
Just cruising in my lowrider.

1065
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:15,417
I just wanted to come by
and say thanks for the ramp.

1066
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:22,632
No need.

1067
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:25,677
It's for your family,
so they don't have to carry you around.

1068
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,014
Are we ever gonna be cool?

1069
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,185
Why would we be cool?

1070
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,149
You hate this.

1071
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,152
This is my world.

1072
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,488
Yeah...

1073
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,492
It might be hard for you to believe,

1074
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:55,623
but I really love your world.

1075
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:07,969
And if I weren't in this dorky neck brace

1076
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,889
and stuck in a wheelchair,

1077
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:14,142
I would probably kiss you.

1078
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,362
Why can't you ever

1079
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:29,491
do anything

1080
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,493
on your own?

1081
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,466
All right, all right. Back to painting.

1082
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,054
Want to help me teach these kids
how to dance?

1083
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:53,306
I can't. I'm in a wheelchair.

1084
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,058
Dance with a brush.

1085
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,410
Robin Hood is back, with a bigger truck.

1086
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,664
We don't have another room
for the furniture, mija.

1087
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:19,874
Robin Hood?

1088
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,029
I need your help with something.

1089
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:01,457
What is all this?

1090
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:04,961
It's for the house.

1091
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,966
- The house?
- Yeah. The house we bought.

1092
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,511
What do you mean, "we"?

1093
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,556
Well, you know, you're gonna have to decide
which room is the master

1094
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:20,643
and where to put your office,
but I think everything else is "we."

1095
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:24,022
If you could, please.

1096
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:27,650
Need you to co-sign, right here on this deed.

1097
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:30,236
Very important.

1098
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,660
- What about your...
- Nora.

1099
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:45,585
My heart is,

1100
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:48,838
and always has been,

1101
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:50,340
yours.

1102
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,016
I love you.

1103
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,037
Is that a "yes"?
