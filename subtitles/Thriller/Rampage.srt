1
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,120
You know the economy is going to crash.

2
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,821
That's why I'm here.
The problem is the bail-out plan.

3
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,323
It's only going to make the
problem worse

4
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,624
and exacerbate things.

5
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,593
The politicians have
to resist the urge..

6
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,261
Coast Guard and environment
cleanup organizations

7
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,629
are working overtime

8
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,149
to clean up the disastrous
53,000-gallon spill

9
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,784
that left over 30 miles
of pristine coastline

10
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:04,352
soaked with sludge and oil.

11
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:07,255
It's still unclear how long it
will take to clean up this mess

12
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:09,657
and what long-term effects it
will have on the environment..

13
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,159
We need to do
something fast.

14
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,094
Adjustable rate mortgages
have already done enough damage

15
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,362
and we have not seen
anything yet.

16
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,264
Just like President Richard
Nixon did to the Vietnamese

17
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,414
back in the late '60s..

18
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,583
Osama bin Laden,
al Qaeda,

19
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,519
these people are out
to kill us. People don't..

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,287
All of these things
contribute to

21
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,224
the problem of overpopulation..

22
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,508
People don't comprehend
the danger

23
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,161
that this country
creates for the world..

24
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:48,963
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

25
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,431
this chemical could kill
a million people..

26
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,951
Oil is not only one
of the reasons,

27
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:55,419
but the main reason
to go to war in Iraq,

28
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,655
despite what federal
governments are saying.

29
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,490
Thousands of Australian
troops have been sent..

30
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,525
As mentioned in that story,

31
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,628
the soaring prices of oil is
a world-wide problem..

32
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,548
Efforts to reduce emissions
and pollution are required

33
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,851
immediately to reduce the
effects of global warming.

34
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,202
If we do not react soon..

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,975
Monetary policy allows
American citizens

36
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,542
to borrow trillions of dollars

37
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:19,743
without the ability to
pay any of the money back..

38
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,245
What were the beachgoers
thinking

39
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,348
when they left 10 tons of
garbage behind on the beach

40
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:25,416
this Labour Day weekend?
The bottom line is..

41
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,318
The shooting happened in a
supermarket parking lot

42
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,420
in broad daylight with
dozens of people around.

43
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,555
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
I was shocked.

44
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,358
I was just standing there,
and he came up shooting.

45
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,810
I saw him fall..

46
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:38,580
He's killed a lot of people here.

47
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,314
Bill, are you up?
Come and have breakfast.

48
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,884
Beautiful woman's ring,
straight out of Africa.

49
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:04,255
Retails at $699.99..

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,727
Hey, darling.

51
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,295
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

52
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,280
Did you sleep okay?

53
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,849
I did. You were
a tiger last night.

54
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,852
Did you put milk out already?

55
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,854
Yeah.
Okay.

56
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:21,256
I want to see if there's a
mirror I can..

57
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,024
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

58
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,025
Good.

59
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,160
You've already got everything.

60
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:26,894
Sweetheart, you're
taking care of business.

61
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,129
That's fantastic.

62
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,364
I've got your coffee.
Let's move things along.

63
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,932
Sweetie, I just want to mention

64
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,401
that these should have
been put away, okay?

65
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:36,104
Okay. I mean,
you've got to chip in.

66
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,106
I thought I did that.

67
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,748
Okay, but
find a way that's not..

68
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,750
because you know what..

69
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,688
I don't want to do this
on a rush,

70
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,123
because it's an important thing.

71
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,625
But your mother and I were
talking last night.

72
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:01,529
We didn't get a lot of sleep..
not for the reason you think.

73
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,865
That's gross.

74
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:07,235
We think it's time you
moved on and moved out.

75
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,671
Fuck!

76
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:11,672
Don't worry about it.

77
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:12,673
Okay.

78
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:13,674
I'll get a napkin.

79
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:15,710
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:18,713
Help your father.

81
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,814
You got it, Dad?

82
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:22,183
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,584
Sorry, Mom.

84
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,685
No, it's okay.

85
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,921
But it's just that,
look, you're 23..

86
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,623
You've got to get your
own place, right?

87
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:29,991
I know. You keep saying that.

88
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,259
You just spilt more on me.

89
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,862
But you.. I know you
guys keep saying that.

91
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:36,064
Sorry.

92
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:39,234
You keep saying that,
but it takes time,

93
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:42,137
because I have to, obviously,
raise the money

94
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:46,408
for my own post-education,
right?

95
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,378
So the deal was is that
I would do that by own,

96
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,213
do my best to
save up that money.

97
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,283
In the meantime,
I would stay with you guys.

98
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,852
How about putting some of that
money into some rent?

99
00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:59,637
What did I do last month?

100
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:01,472
We talked about the fridge.

101
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,274
Remember, when you
first suggested it?

102
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,559
I said I didn't..
Honey, what did..

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,578
And then you said that that
would buy me some..

104
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,315
That's a classic guilt trip by
the way, and I appreciate that.

105
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,715
No, but he did say..

106
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,684
I know what you're doing.
You learned from the best.

107
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:15,053
If you guys want me
to go back to school,

108
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:17,055
then obviously I have to have a
little bit of money

109
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,190
to do that too.

110
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,126
Look, honestly, Bill,
you don't want to be the..

111
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,361
We shouldn't have
gotten into it now,

112
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,862
because you and I..
we have to go.

113
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:26,730
Yeah.

114
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:27,798
I'm just saying..
I'm just saying, okay..

115
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,400
5 o'clock, mister,

116
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,485
we're going to have
a roundtable discussion.

117
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,087
Do me a favour.

118
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,688
Do me a favour. Do me a favour.

119
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,407
You guys need to
help me out a little.

120
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:37,425
Give me a call at work.
Give me a call at work.

121
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:39,427
We're going to.. we're going to
have a bite to eat.

122
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:40,895
We'll grab some lunch.

123
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,030
We'll grab a newspaper.

124
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:43,631
We'll go look at some
apartments,

125
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:45,934
and we'll have you in a new
place by the end of the week.

126
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,604
Okay, just as long as you're
paying for the lunch, because..

127
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,805
Man.
Now, you guys. You..

128
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,777
You can push each other's
buttons like no one,

129
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:57,979
birds of a feather.

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,083
I'm fine. I thought we had a
good situation, but obviously..

131
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:05,419
We have a good situation.
But let's not make it a bad one.

132
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,854
That's what we're saying.

133
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,422
We're going to help you out
for the first..

134
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:09,958
for the first couple
of years, okay?

135
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,759
We will help you out.

136
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm not saying that we're
going to pay 100%,

137
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,595
but we will help you out.

138
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,531
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

139
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:18,433
We're going to meet here. I'm
going to pick up some pizzas,

140
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,267
and then we're going to sit
and have a nice discussion.

141
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,636
But I have to go.

142
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:23,103
I mean, if you guys are willing
to help me out, I'm cool.

143
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,371
Yeah.

144
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay?
Yeah.

145
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,207
We still love you, man.
It's not to, you know..

146
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,510
I know.

147
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,078
Okay, have a good one today.
Okay?

148
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,146
Okay.

149
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,147
Give me a call at work.

150
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,649
Be safe.

151
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:36,160
There you go, enjoy.

152
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,294
Hey, how are you doing?

153
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:38,563
Good, man.

154
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,698
A double espresso macchiato
with extra foam.

155
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,534
Sure, that will be $4.50.

156
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,157
There you go.
Thanks, man.

157
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,896
Extra foam, man.

158
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,782
You got it.

159
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:05,840
There you go.

160
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,942
That's not what I ordered, man.

161
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,711
Yeah, it is.

162
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,580
That's not a macchiato.
There's no foam in there at all.

163
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:13,981
Yeah, there is.
There's some right there.

164
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:15,149
No, no, no.

165
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,984
No, a lot of foam,
a lot of foam.

166
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:19,720
Dude, look,
this is like half milk.

167
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,122
That's not a macchiato.

168
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:23,124
Look, there's..
there's foam in there.

169
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:27,995
There you go, more foam.

170
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:30,298
Yeah, but take.. take some of
the milk out of it, man.

171
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,365
I'm not taking any
of the milk out.

172
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,634
That's a perfectly good
macchiato.

173
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,768
Give me back my money, man.

174
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,769
I'm not giving you..

175
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,804
Give me back my money.

176
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,239
I'm not giving you
your money back.

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,673
Just take your coffee.

178
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,275
I'm not paying for something
that I didn't order, man.

179
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,410
Give me back my money.

180
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,145
I make the best
coffees in this town.

181
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,279
Take your coffee and go.

182
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
I don't give a f..
what you make, bro.

183
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,833
But I didn't.. I didn't order
this, so I don't want it.

184
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,234
I don't care.

185
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,769
That's a good coffee.
Take it.

186
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,939
You know, just take it and shove
it up your ass, all right?

187
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:02,363
Fucking idiot, man.

188
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:11,188
Hey, man, you don't want
to give me back my $4.50?

189
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,075
You don't want to give
me back my $4.50?

190
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:15,076
No.

191
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,077
No?

192
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,079
No.

193
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:20,815
All right, man.

194
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:22,549
Here, take a..

195
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,786
take a fucking roll while you're
going out the door.

196
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,808
Fuck.

197
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:52,847
<i>Bill!</i>

198
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,449
Bill!

199
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,450
Bill!

200
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,987
Bill!
Yeah, what?

201
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:02,139
Come on. Your lunch has been
over like 15 minutes ago.

202
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,424
What do you mean? I took my
lunch break 15 minutes ago.

203
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,878
Bill, take the mask off.
I've got tons of cars in there,

204
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,714
and you're wasting
time on this van?

205
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,682
All right?

206
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,566
I already finished
3 cars today, Jim.

207
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,869
Yeah, yeah. 3 cars?

208
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,373
Come on. Get in there.

209
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,741
Okay, the clock says work, work.

210
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,910
Okay, you should check
your clocks, though.

211
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:25,095
Maybe I should clock you.

212
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:32,836
I don't think you should treat
your best worker like that, Jim.

213
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,104
Bill, just get in there and make
some money for us, okay?

214
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,257
How about a raise?

215
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,525
Yeah, Bill?
Why don't you fuck off?

216
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:38,526
9 bucks.

217
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,461
Yeah, 9 bucks.

218
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:03,166
That's it, yeah. Right.

219
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,168
It's all prepped and ready.

220
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,805
The stresses from war
do not make a man do this.

221
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:28,492
What makes a man do this are
shame and rage.

222
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,611
<i>What do you do when
the sun sets?</i>

223
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,880
<i>Gonne get down
when the sun sets.</i>

224
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,048
Yeah!

225
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,083
Late.

226
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:38,552
Sorry, I'm late.

227
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:40,955
The funniest thing is that you
and this piece of shit..

228
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,157
only you would do a burn out

229
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:44,525
coming into a
shit hole like this.

230
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:46,227
Yeah, it's $300.

231
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,979
I know you've got to work for
6 months to make that, but..

232
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:53,601
Hey, I got you a present.

233
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:54,836
Why? What the fuck, man?

234
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:56,203
Read up.

235
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,339
Listen, by the way, you've got
to stop having these things

236
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
sent to my fucking house, man.

237
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,308
Yes, these are
the last ones, man.

238
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,243
Yeah, but my dad
is getting pissed, okay?

239
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:05,346
And what the fuck is in this?

240
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,047
What did he say?

241
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,716
He was asking what it was.

242
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,417
What did you tell him?

243
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:11,819
To mind his own
fucking business.

244
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,255
Good, good.

245
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,174
No one can know.
It's a surprise.

246
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,875
Piece of shit.
Watch your head.

247
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,565
Fuck. Yeah!

248
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,266
Let's go eat.

249
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,935
Do you really want
to fucking eat

250
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:29,470
in this shit hole Chicken Den
piece of shit?

251
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,857
This is America, man.
This is what we eat, okay?

252
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:33,858
I love it.

253
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,092
Dude, Chicken Den?

254
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:36,193
Do you know what they do with
these animals?

255
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:37,494
It's all-American.
This is America, baby.

256
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,712
They sit in cages,
sitting in their shit all day.

257
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,732
You're such a fucking prick.

258
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,366
How are you doing?

259
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,135
Welcome to Chicken Den.
How may I help you?

260
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,637
Give me..

261
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,006
Give me the 4-piece,

262
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,008
a 4-piece mixed meat.

263
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,009
Do you want the combo?

264
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,477
Combo.

265
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:57,181
Fuck.

266
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:01,785
A salad, a garden salad.

267
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:03,454
A 4-piece combo?
Hi, sorry.

268
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:04,988
A 4-piece combo, you said?

269
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,123
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

270
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:08,543
You're just going to have salad?

271
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:11,078
Draw cartoon chickens
saying, "Eat me."

272
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,379
$10.70, please.

273
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,456
How is your day, love?

275
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,291
Perfect. How is yours?

276
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,777
Sunshine and rainbows.

277
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:32,516
A combo and a salad.

278
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,085
She seem a little bit pissed off?

279
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,953
Yeah.
Thank you.

280
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:36,954
High-five.

281
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:38,322
Don't leave me hanging.

282
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,361
This is a fresh, fresh salad.

283
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,696
I'll bet they went out and
picked it this morning.

284
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:49,399
That looks disgusting.

285
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,135
Your salad probably has bugs
crawling all over it.

286
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,238
Dude, move this.

287
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,406
You're going to knock
it off the fucking edge.

288
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,108
So tomorrow, 1:00.

289
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,443
Yeah. Tomorrow, 1:00.

290
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,011
Paintball, right?
No problems with work?

291
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,847
Dude, I've got to call in sick.

292
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,081
You haven't done that yet?

293
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,684
Well, dude, I have
to call it on the day.

294
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,151
I'm not going to
call today and say,

295
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,253
"Listen, tomorrow I'm not going
to be in, because I'm sick."

296
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,490
I talked to you about
this 2 weeks ago.

297
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,057
Yeah, I have to call in
tomorrow.

298
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:15,459
I said, you said..

299
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,260
Can I have the tray?

300
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,896
I took the day off work too.
We have to play.

301
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,332
Holy shit!

302
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,334
Crap!

303
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,238
Would you get me a napkin?

304
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,406
Like, she didn't even say
anything.

305
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,641
She didn't go, "I'm sorry."

306
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:31,858
No like, "I'm sorry."

307
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,061
Hi!
You brought napkins.

308
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,697
No, no. We'll probably need
like.. I don't know.. a mop.

309
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:37,931
Are you going to apologize?

310
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,400
I mean, you fucking got
this shit all over us.

311
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:40,835
Look, I'm sorry.

312
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,002
I'm laughing because you got it
on him, and he's a prick.

313
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,037
Could you
get me more chicken,

314
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,172
because this is right
all over the place.

315
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,107
Yeah, I'll make that.

316
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,224
What's your problem?

317
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,225
I don't have a problem.
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,676
Is there something
wrong with you?

319
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:50,828
Look, I'll get
this replaced. That's fine.

320
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,329
She's upset with her life.

321
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,164
Jesus!

322
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,082
Can I get my money back?

323
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,767
Look, I'll get you more stuff,

324
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,069
but I'm not giving
you your money back.

325
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,203
I don't want more stuff.

326
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,405
I'm sorry I dumped stuff on you,

327
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,672
but I'll just have
it replaced, okay?

328
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,141
Lady!

329
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,909
It's okay.

330
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,344
Do you have a manager?

331
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,712
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

332
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,881
Hold on. No, no, no.
Do you have a manager?

333
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,250
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It will dry.

334
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,486
This is why I don't want to eat
in these fucking places, man.

335
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,755
Look at this shit.

336
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:18,889
Do you think she likes it?

337
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,725
Dude, do you think that I like

338
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:24,461
having whatever-the-fuck this
kind of salad is,

339
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:29,033
this salad dressing,
extra ranch?

340
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,268
Is this quality service?

341
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,536
Hello? Hello?

342
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,126
Yeah, don't forget
the tray, right?

343
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,198
That's great. It's all clean.

344
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,366
Thank you.

345
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,467
Like, take this guy.

346
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,820
You see him walking
down the street?

347
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,505
Smile on his face.

348
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:54,391
He's got nice clothes on.

349
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,393
What's he doing? What do you
think he does?

350
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:59,963
I don't know. What's he do?

351
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:01,932
Maybe a banker.

352
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,501
He's delirious, though.

353
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:06,604
Maybe a travelling salesman?

354
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,206
He's delirious, why?

355
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,807
That guy helps to
wreck the economy.

356
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,476
He helps to wreck the world.

357
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:16,814
He eats in Styrofoam
fucking cups.

358
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,949
He's terrible, delirious.

359
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,351
That's not what the world needs.

360
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,203
What does the world need?

361
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:25,038
The world needs change, man.

362
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,007
What kind of change?

363
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:30,911
Who is going to do it?

364
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,312
Dude, the problem is..

365
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,147
As one person,
what could you do?

366
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:35,916
That this fucking world grows

367
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,035
by like 70 million people a year.
That's the problem.

368
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:40,304
There's too many people.

369
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,272
And so our natural resources
are running out.

370
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,708
And no one, and no one..
look, we have trains.

371
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,711
We have.. we have cars,
tons of cars

372
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:50,680
that are just burning up gas and
making this place disgusting.

373
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,149
We've got a hole in the ozone.

374
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,218
Blah, blah, blah.

375
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:57,188
You have chicken that looks
like.. yeah, of course, man.

376
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:58,989
It's just disgusting.
That's all.

377
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,024
It's just absolutely
fucking sick.

378
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:03,060
It makes me just sick.

379
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,629
But what are you supposed
to do, stop living?

380
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,848
There's 2 kinds of people..
leavers and takers.

381
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:11,868
And the leavers coexist.

382
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,704
We need people that coexist.

383
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:18,008
And the takers is the
society of the world.

384
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,411
The takers is the
people that fucking..

385
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:25,349
that just, like, drive
Ferraris not caring.

386
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,867
Because people
have to make money.

387
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,769
No, people don't
have to make money.

388
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,271
People have to make money.

389
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:31,738
That's the thing. That's what
I'm talking about, man.

390
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:33,373
People don't have to.

391
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:35,042
That's the thing that society
drills in your head

392
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,844
over and over and over since
you've been fucking 5-years-old

393
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,545
that you have to have
a big bank account.

394
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:39,880
You have to make a lot of money.
You have to have a fast car.

395
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:42,749
It makes life a lot easier,
doesn't it?

396
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,084
Dude, but what happens..

397
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,320
Would you want to be poor?
Do you want to be poor?

398
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,855
Do you want to have no money?

399
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,890
You keep going down this road.
Do you know where it's going?

400
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:51,658
So you just think just keep
going down the reckless path,

401
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,078
just fucking.. pile straight
ahead, because there's no..

402
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,245
We're all just fucked.

403
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,513
What's the point?

404
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:57,747
That's the most pessimistic
point of view

405
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,149
I've ever heard in my life.

406
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,836
You're a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

407
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,504
You're all talk, buddy.
You're all talk.

408
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,090
Snap.

409
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,859
All talk?

410
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,393
All talk, no action.

411
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:41,641
That's helping. I stood on my
feet all day today.

412
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:45,245
Not to change the subject,
but when is dinner?

413
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,647
No.. hi.

414
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:49,283
Hey, hey, hey.

415
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:50,317
Yeah?

416
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,069
No phone call?

417
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,270
Sorry.

418
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,288
Where have you been?

419
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,389
What are you guys doing?

420
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,456
What do you mean,
what have we been doing?

421
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:57,858
We've been waiting for you?

422
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,076
Remember, we had this meeting
planned, right?

423
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,077
I was going to pick up pizza..

424
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,379
How long is
it going to take?

425
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,815
Come on.

426
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:06,718
It's just going to
take as long as it takes.

427
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,688
No, no, no, no.
Can we do it tomorrow morning?

428
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,625
I've got some very exciting
news for you guys,

429
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:18,812
and I actually ate at the
Chicken Den..

430
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,581
Come on, Bill.

431
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:21,982
We organized this.

432
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,083
I know.

433
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:24,652
We talked about it this
morning, remember?

434
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:26,754
It was like 9 hours ago.

435
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:28,088
Tomorrow..
Jeez.

436
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,489
We'll talk about
it at breakfast,

437
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,226
and I've got very, very exciting
news for you guys, okay?

438
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,528
Okay, are you going to
be on time for once?

439
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:35,595
Yes, on time.

440
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:36,730
That's exciting news.

441
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:37,798
Okay, well, I will make a
special breakfast.

442
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,202
No.. no coping out this time.

443
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:43,854
No, absolutely, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

444
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,089
You promise?

445
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,858
Promise. Good night, guys.

446
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,362
I kind of figured
that would happen.

447
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,530
Yeah, that's typical.

448
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:57,968
That's typical, every,
every time.

449
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:59,820
Why is he resisting
this so much?

450
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:00,988
I don't know.

451
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:03,457
Do you think he's hiding
something? Is he okay?

452
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,492
I just think he's..

453
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,828
Psychiatrist Michelle His tow
has a theory about Kyle.

454
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:12,449
When I saw him, he had already
murdered 7 people.

455
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,685
Our work is gripping and
unpredictable.

456
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:19,423
This is not the way
conventional psychiatry works.

457
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:22,292
Up next, an interview with
Michelle His tow.

458
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:08,288
We have the right to drive
whenever, wherever,

459
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,024
and whatever we want, but we
need to understand the effects

460
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,458
of the carbon footprint

461
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,927
and realize the
environmental damage

462
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,712
cars are causing
to our planet.

463
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:18,132
Al Qaeda is all over Iraq.

464
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,599
The administration
of the U.S. president

465
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,535
will likely
double the bounty on..

466
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:23,270
The BTK killer has confessed

467
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:25,038
to killing 10 people and
tonight..

468
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,173
The United States will deploy
30,000 additional troops..

469
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:30,845
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

470
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:33,547
At the same time, our natural
resources are dwindling.. coal,

471
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:35,449
oil, gas, water.

472
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,184
Okay, and with the development
of the third world

473
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:39,086
we're just creating a ticking
time bomb,

474
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:42,689
and even though we know that
forests are essential

475
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,844
to reducing carbon emissions,
we continue to cut them down,

476
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:51,548
whether it's for housing,
farming, alternative energy,

477
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,249
or just useless furniture

478
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,319
instead of truly getting
together and fighting

479
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,540
for something, fighting
against global warming,

480
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,110
against political
and social unrest.

481
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:06,113
Our politicians are using the
same lame band-aid techniques

482
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:09,466
up for re-elections,
over and over.

483
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,702
What we need is change.

484
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,537
We can't stand
for this anymore.

485
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:16,055
Any why do we accept this?

486
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:18,525
Because we're a society
built on wants.

487
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:19,760
Not needs.

488
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:21,995
What are we taught
to want from childhood?

489
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:24,464
Big bank accounts.

490
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:29,102
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

491
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,470
Okay, facelifts.

492
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,272
Does this help anyone? No.

493
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:35,074
What is this? This is ego.

494
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:38,178
This doesn't help the world.

495
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:40,280
We need to bind together.

496
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:41,715
We don't need to be
individuals.

497
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:46,670
We need to become whole as a
country, as world.

498
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:49,540
We need someone who
will stand for something.

499
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,776
We need someone who
believes in what they say

500
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:55,262
and believes in actions
changing the way

501
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,897
that we view our world.

502
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:35,301
We can't survive with our
politicians focusing their time

503
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:37,270
on fighting religious wars,

504
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:40,907
fighting over control
of natural resources.

505
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:44,077
Can anyone do this?

506
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:46,580
Well, I don't know.

507
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,448
Do you have any thoughts?

508
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:54,521
We're so precious, aren't we?

509
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:56,456
Everyone has got to live.

510
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,892
Everyone has got to be happy.

511
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,761
It's a joke.

512
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:03,497
It's an absolute joke.

513
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:05,515
Humanity can't survive
over the next 100 years.

514
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,016
The facts don't lie.

515
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,619
We need someone who will
stand for something.

516
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,906
We need someone who
believes in what they say

517
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:15,809
and believes in action,
believes in positive action.

518
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,614
It's an absolute joke.

519
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:23,617
Evan, that's what
you didn't get.

520
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:25,151
That's what you didn't get.

521
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:27,587
You think people are equal.
They're not.

522
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:30,673
They're not.

523
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,550
Just like President Richard Nixon
did to the Vietnamese

524
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,152
back in the late '60s..

525
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:01,505
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda,

526
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,707
these people are out
to kill us. People don't..

527
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,475
All of these things
contribute

528
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,844
to the problem of
overpopulation.

529
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:09,446
People don't comprehend
the danger

530
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,015
that this country
creates for the world.

531
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:14,851
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

532
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,853
this chemical could kill a
million people.

533
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:19,790
About society and people
in the humanitarian sense.

534
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,024
We need to changes
to protect the..

535
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,665
Thessalonians 3:10 says,

536
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,985
"For even when we are with you,
this we commanded you,

537
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:35,722
that if any would not work,
neither should he eat."

538
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:38,508
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

539
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:50,203
And why do we accept this?

540
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:52,939
Because we're a society
built on wants.

541
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,374
Not needs. What are we taught
to want from childhood?

542
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:59,078
Big bank accounts.

543
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,231
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

544
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,700
Okay, facelifts.

545
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,301
Does this help anyone? No.

546
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:07,320
What is this? This is ego.

547
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,623
We need someone who
will stand for something.

548
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:12,859
We need someone who
believes in what they say

549
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,063
and believes in action,
believes in positive action

550
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:18,882
and changing the way
that we look at things,

551
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:22,052
changing the way that
we view our world.

552
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,720
So that's what I'll do.

553
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:24,854
My name is Evan Drince.

554
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:26,856
Why not?

555
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:32,828
Bill?

556
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,213
Breakfast is ready, Bill.

557
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,118
What?

558
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,886
I said breakfast!

559
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,122
I'll be up in 15 minutes!
I'm working out!

560
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,685
Good morning, honey.

561
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,754
Morning.
That smells really good.

562
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,555
I'm glad we're actually having a
nice breakfast together,

563
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:02,409
because yesterday
was a bit tense.

564
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,278
Well, you guys dropped a..
dropped a bomb on me.

565
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,613
I know, but I feel like..

566
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:10,250
I think we've reached some
kind of agreement, right?

567
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:13,002
And today, what I'm
going to do for you guys

568
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:16,256
is that I'm going
to be proactive.

569
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:18,975
And today, I'm going to stay in.
I've got the day off.

570
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:21,061
I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

571
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:22,228
and I'm thinking..

572
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:24,965
What did my ears just hear?

573
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:29,069
That I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

574
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,104
mechanical engineer.

575
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,105
Honey!

576
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,440
Who kidnapped our son?

577
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,208
What's going on?
That's fantastic!

578
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,776
Yeah, it makes sense, right?

579
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:37,944
Okay, you know, I..

580
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:39,512
That's fantastic. Good job.

581
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:41,114
So are you guys happy?

582
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:43,849
I've got to say
I'm really proud of you.

583
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,019
Well, I think it's
about time, right?

584
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,523
I think our little talk maybe
got in there somewhere?

585
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:54,878
You guys kicked my little
tushie out the door.

586
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:56,179
With love.

587
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,881
Absolutely.

588
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:58,831
You know what?
Here's the thing.

589
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:00,367
You're going to feel better
about yourself

590
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,168
once you have, like, goals.

591
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:04,404
I know. I do have goals, Mom.

592
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,205
Look, I've got to go.

593
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,208
We'll talk about
it more later.

594
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:09,209
Okay, chin up.

595
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,776
Okay. Bye, Dad.

596
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:12,128
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

597
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,698
Okay, we'll talk at dinner.

598
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,765
I'm really, really
proud of you.

599
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,266
I think what you're
going to feel

600
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:21,705
is that you have goals in life
now and a direction.

601
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:22,706
Right.

602
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:23,973
Yeah.

603
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:27,610
Yeah, I woke up today
feeling enthusiastic.

604
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:31,113
My little boy,
he's growing up.

605
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:33,032
Come here.

606
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:37,570
It's out of love that we kick
your bum.. your bum.

607
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,005
Sorry about the language.

608
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,590
Have a good day at work, okay?

609
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:43,309
I will, sweetheart.
I'm very excited for you,

610
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,311
and I want to see how this turns
out with the applications.

611
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:46,479
Okay.
Okay.

612
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
I'll see you tonight.

613
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:48,482
Bye, honey.

614
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,485
All right.

615
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:52,887
Evan,

616
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:55,687
you think people are equal.
They're not.

617
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:57,607
They're not.

618
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:00,177
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan.

619
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:03,246
You're such an idiot.

620
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:07,250
They're like a drop in a bucket.

621
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:11,104
I just poured the bucket out.

622
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:14,541
Yeah, you couldn't do anything.

623
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,911
All you could do is talk..
meaningless.

624
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,780
Do anything.

625
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:24,684
Well, I guess I did.

626
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,019
Shot about 5 or 6 times
and everybody..

627
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,855
most of the shooting right
here at this location

628
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:31,074
where most of the
bullet casings are..

629
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:33,309
In nature, there's
survival of the fittest.

630
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,229
What separates us
from the animals?

631
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,181
It's our consciousness.

632
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,916
It's our ego.

633
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:43,052
It's our sense of self..

634
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:47,022
So, all of a sudden, we care
about ourselves too much.

635
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:50,293
We care about our
fellow man too much.

636
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:55,632
We have to do anything that
we can to keep them alive.

637
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:58,568
You know, the animals
just want to eat.

638
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,154
They just want to eat.

639
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,157
They'll kill you
so they can eat.

640
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,667
Can anyone do this?

641
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:16,669
I don't know.

642
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,971
Do you have any thoughts?

643
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:30,399
Let's face it.

644
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,204
If we could just kill everybody,

645
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:39,242
you know, in the third world,

646
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:42,211
people with cancer, you know,

647
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:45,115
people that are sucking up
our resources,

648
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:47,050
maybe we could survive.

649
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,417
The Bible says we must not kill..

650
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,520
The bible says we must not
commit adultery.

651
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:51,988
Most of the shooting right
here at this location

652
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:53,156
where most of the bullet
casings are,

653
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:54,490
and then ran off
in that direction

654
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:55,925
while still shooting..

655
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:59,663
Survival of the fittest is
really, is a real theory.

656
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:03,599
That's a way to create balance.

657
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,100
I don't believe in god.

658
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:08,938
I believe in what I see,
the pain and suffering I see.

659
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,506
I believe that when I go out in
the street

660
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:12,074
and I see a mother who can't
feed her child..

661
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:15,177
Described as a loner who never
fit in with his classmates..

662
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,146
Couldn't do anything.

663
00:32:17,147 --> 00:32:19,816
All you could do was talk..
Meaningless.

664
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:16,872
Don't forget Bingo
at Centerville Bingo Hall.

665
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:18,874
Now back to the local news..

666
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,008
The world needs change, man.

667
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,690
What kind of change?
Who's going to do it? You?

668
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:41,498
How long is it going to take?

669
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,918
Can anyone do this?

670
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:46,386
I don't know.

671
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,905
Do you have any thoughts?

672
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,746
All talk, no action.

673
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:25,008
Start up.

674
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,512
Here we go.

675
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:49,415
Jesus.

676
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,650
Fuck.

677
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:23,082
Come out with your hands up!

678
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:28,771
Open the back.

679
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:33,062
Get down, you piece of shit!

680
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,814
Get down!
On the ground!

681
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,853
Get down!

682
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,026
Down on the ground!

683
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:49,545
Shit!

684
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,142
Hi.

685
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:54,994
You're scared as shit?

686
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,049
Here we go.

687
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,050
Please..

688
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:54,746
Hey, man, how are you?

689
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:57,333
Hey, man,
you remember me?

690
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:06,442
Why don't you make me
a double espresso macchiato

691
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,177
with extra foam?

692
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:09,412
You got it.

693
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:12,865
Why don't you make it like
your life depends on it?

694
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,705
With extra foam!

695
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:30,800
You like to take your sweet
fucking time, don't you?

696
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:32,835
There you go.

697
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:45,665
Why is this so difficult?

698
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:50,419
I mean, how hard can it be?

699
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,337
I'm going to give you 5 seconds

700
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:52,672
to get the fuck out of here.

701
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm going to start counting
right now.

702
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:56,275
1..

703
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:57,643
Are you serious?

704
00:41:57,644 --> 00:42:01,246
Yeah, yeah!
I'm pretty fucking serious!

705
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:02,515
1..

706
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,502
2.. hurry up, motherfucker!

707
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,120
Run, Forrest!

708
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:09,306
Now you're getting it!

709
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,108
5, bitch!

710
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:37,516
Again, we are strongly advising
people to stay inside,

711
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:41,220
as early reports indicate that
chaos in downtown Centerville

712
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:44,089
is caused by a
heavily-armed individual

713
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,458
firing randomly
at innocent bystanders.

714
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:49,995
Hello, beautiful ladies.

715
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,633
Hold on a minute.

716
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,568
No, calm down. No, no.

717
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:01,240
You get over there.
You get over there.

718
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:04,576
Hey, ladies. Out of the kitchen.

719
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:06,245
Go join your pretty friends.

720
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:07,446
You too.

721
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:09,514
Come on.

722
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:11,116
Let's go.

723
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:13,285
There you go. Come on.

724
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:14,453
You too, Blondie.

725
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:17,356
Who else is here?

726
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,657
There's no one else here.

727
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:19,658
No one?

728
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,659
It's just us here.

729
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,261
What about this door?

730
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:23,528
Come on, ladies.

731
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:25,530
Come over here. Get down.

732
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:43,215
It gets so hot in this thing.

733
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:54,009
I have my cell phone here.

734
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:19,985
I've got..
I've got 2 kids at home.

735
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:21,953
I've got a husband.
I've got..

736
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,775
Please! Let us go!
What is it you..

737
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:46,862
I feel nauseous.

738
00:44:58,057 --> 00:44:59,658
Come on..

739
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:06,965
My God!

740
00:45:10,237 --> 00:45:13,839
Is everybody okay?

741
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,308
What a fucking dickhead!

742
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:18,277
Are you guys okay?

743
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:19,478
Holy shit!

744
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:21,113
My God! Does anybody have..

745
00:45:21,114 --> 00:45:24,015
Where's the phone?

746
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,923
Everyone over here!

747
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,892
Over here!

748
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:33,926
Get down!

749
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:35,261
Get down! Get down!

750
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:38,764
Please!

751
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:41,516
I don't know why I did that.

752
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:45,721
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken off my mask.

753
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:48,624
Please, don't do it. Please!

754
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,975
I have to.

755
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,221

Hey, buddy,

766
00:47:25,706 --> 00:47:28,775
I'm a little bit peckish.
You got something to eat?

767
00:47:30,376 --> 00:47:33,262
Why don't you get me the best
sandwich you've got?

768
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:36,398
The best, tastiest
sandwich you've got.

769
00:47:36,399 --> 00:47:38,199
What have you got
to drink, iced tea?

770
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:46,625
That looks like shit.

771
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:48,060
Here you go.

772
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:50,129
That's a nice hairnet.
Do they make you wear that?

773
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,230
Yeah, thanks.

774
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:53,032
Free of charge. Just..

775
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:55,234
Good. I completely
forgot my wallet.

776
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:56,635
Right.

777
00:47:56,636 --> 00:47:59,638
Thank you.

778
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,006
Have a good day.

779
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:02,841
Thank you for coming to

Excuse me! Sir, I need that!

00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:17,833
I-27. I-27!

795
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:20,669
I need that back, please, sir.

796
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,903
It's I-27!

797
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:23,071
Excuse me..

798
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:26,608
I-27! Bingo!

799
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,678
Bingo?

800
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,780
No Bingo.

801
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:50,632
You guys don't need
my help at all.

802

I-27. Two seven.

803
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:34,709
And we are still getting reports
that a brown van

804
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,445
was seen smashing into the
front of the police station

805
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:39,181
just moments before
the massive explosion

806
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:42,401
that woke Centerville
residents up this morning.

807
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:59,601
Everybody get
behind the counter.

808
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,570
Ladies, back the fuck up!

809
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,056
Nobody presses the alarm!
Let's go!

810
00:51:04,057 --> 00:51:05,173
Ladies, back the fuck up!

811
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:07,726
Don't touch those alarms!

812
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:09,861
You too.

813
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,264
Let's go, big shot.

814
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:14,583
Don't be scared, big shot.

815
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,601
Let's go. Come on.

816
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,964
Get him!

817
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,087
What the fuck was that?!

818
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:47,482
Anybody else want
to play hero?

819
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:49,518
No?

820
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:15,244
Knock, knock, knock,
Mr. Manager.

821
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:16,511
What are you doing in here?

822
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,780
Give me your fucking phone!

823
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:21,649
Everyone is out there.
What are you doing in here?

824
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,918
Get the fuck out here! Come on!

825
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:25,787
Come on!

826
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:27,889
What do I want?
What do you think I want?

827
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,890
Money.

828
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:30,292
Come on, quick.
Money, money.

829
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:32,394
Money?
You're a smart one, genius.

830
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:33,395
Get in the back!

831
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:34,429
It's in the safe.

832
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:35,730
Where? In the safe? Go!

833
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,099
I don't have the key.
I don't have the key.

834
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,400
You don't have the fucking key?
Where is the fucking key?

835
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:39,401
In my office.

836
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:41,086
Go get it.

837
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,054
Don't fuck around!

838
00:52:43,055 --> 00:52:47,058
You, you work here or do you
just dress like an idiot?

839
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:49,361
Empty the registers, fuck face.

840
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:51,162
Empty the registers.

841
00:52:51,163 --> 00:52:52,564
You look like a fucking idiot
when you're scared,

842
00:52:52,565 --> 00:52:54,466
you know that?

843
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:57,168
I have the key.
I've got the key!

844
00:52:57,169 --> 00:53:00,639
Come here!
Come here!

845
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,008
Hurry up!

846
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:07,762
Open the safe. Open the safe.

847
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:10,148
Hurry up. What are you,
retarded?

848
00:53:17,973 --> 00:53:20,292
Give me.. give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

849
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,730
Keep it.

850
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:31,753
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

851
00:53:31,754 --> 00:53:34,689
Bro, calm down.

852
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,775
Calm down, all right?

853
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:38,710
Everything is going to be okay.

854
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:39,694
I'm not going to kill you.

855
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:43,615
I don't know why I'm not.

856
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:46,451
Is this your first time?

857
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:49,955
Is this your
first time?

858
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:52,090
What the fuck is wrong with you?

859
00:53:52,391 --> 00:53:54,076
What the fuck is wrong with you?

860
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:56,378
Punch in the code!

861
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,582
I got it! I got it!

862
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,116
There you go.
There it is.

863
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,922
Fill it up.
Yes, sir.

864
00:54:10,726 --> 00:54:12,260
You see? You see?

865
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:14,095
It's money.

866
00:54:14,096 --> 00:54:17,132
It's about as
worthless as you are.

867
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,166
Hurry up.

868
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,707
I'm hurrying.
Hurry up.

869
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:22,387
Please, just don't shoot.

870
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:25,840
That's it. That's all of it.

871
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:28,460
Give me the fucking bag.
Stay there.

872
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:29,861
Thank you.
Pinhead.

873
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:57,138
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything,

874
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:59,407
because all you use it for

875
00:54:59,408 --> 00:55:02,944
is stupid and senseless shit!

876
00:55:02,945 --> 00:55:05,781
What is he doing out there?

877
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:18,626
Say goodbye!

878
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:25,833
Lock the door!

879
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:28,770
Have a nice day!

880
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,981
Just stay inside.

881
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:22,424
Once again, please stay indoors.

882
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:25,093
Do not go outside
until local authorities

883
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:27,095
have told you that
it's safe to.

884
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:47,032
Sheriff Malvoy.

885
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:49,568
The blaze is keeping all
available fire trucks

886
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:51,836
and fire-fighters
extremely busy

887
00:56:51,837 --> 00:56:55,339
with no news on any survivors
in the collapsed building.

888
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:07,486
Individual went amok in the
downtown shopping district,

889
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:11,189
seemingly killing random people
without motive or reason.

890
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,391
I don't know how this
could happen here,

891
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:15,160
or anywhere, for that matter.

892
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,816
Centerville? Centerville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

893
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,818
Come back.

894
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:28,140
Centerville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

895
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:31,008
Clark and Bradley has been
robbed by an armed assailant.

896
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:33,311
We're heading back into town on
Cross Road.

897
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:35,080
30 minutes out. Over.

898
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:40,352
What the hell is going on, Ray?

899
00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:46,091
Again, please be advised

900
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:49,027
of the location of a suspected
armoured and armed terrorist.

901
00:57:50,496 --> 00:57:52,697
Therefore, we still
strongly recommend

902
00:57:52,698 --> 00:57:54,699
that everyone stays indoors.

903
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:00,038
<i>Honey. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you okay?</i>

904
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,406
Hey, Mom. Yeah, I'm okay.

905
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:03,341
<i>Do you know what's
going on right now?</i>

906
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:05,310
<i>You haven't..
you haven't seen anything?</i>

907
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:06,544
What happened?

908
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:07,879
<i>No, turn on the
television, Honey.</i>

909
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,947
<i>There's, I guess,
one guy, they think,</i>

910
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,449
<i>killing people all over town.</i>

911
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,450
What do you mean?

912
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:13,451
<i>Yes, yes! Killing people!</i>

913
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,452
What do you mean
he killed people?

914
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:15,720
<i>It's crazy, but you're fine.</i>

915
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,188
<i>You're at home working
on your stuff, right?</i>

916
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:18,856
I'm fine. I'm just..
I'm at home. Where are you?

917
00:58:18,857 --> 00:58:22,327
<i>I'm watching it on the news at work,
and it's terrible.</i>

918
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:24,929
You're at work?
You're going to stay there?

919
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,197
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

920
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,698
You're not going to come home?

921
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,234
<i>No, not just yet, sweetheart.</i>

922
00:58:29,235 --> 00:58:30,968
<i>I'm going to go meet your dad,
and we're going to wait there.</i>

923
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:32,537
Okay, when are you
going to be back?

924
00:58:32,538 --> 00:58:33,938
<i>Well, sweetheart, as soon
as we can get there, okay?</i>

925
00:58:33,939 --> 00:58:35,206
<i>Just please stay safe.</i>

926
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:36,474
Okay, I'll be back..
I'll be here.

927
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,243
<i>Sorry, honey,
you're breaking up.</i>

928
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:40,378
I'll be back..
I mean, I'll be here.

929
00:58:40,379 --> 00:58:42,547
<i>Yes, stay there, okay?</i>

930
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:44,616
<i>Sweetie, I love you.
Please be safe, okay?</i>

931
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:46,017
Okay, stay safe.

932
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:48,285
<i>All right, baby. I love you.
Bye-bye.</i>

933
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:31,762
Fuck!

934
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:33,281
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, man!

935
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,034
Evan.

936
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:37,118
Billy.
Hey.

937
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,036
<i>Yeah, where are you?</i>

938
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm running some
errands right now, man.

939
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:40,121
<i>What errands?</i>

940
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:42,703
I'm coming right now, Bro.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

941
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:45,604
Don't go anywhere.
I'm getting in my car right now.

942
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:47,144
Okay, bye.

943
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:08,949
I'm going fucking nuts.

944
01:00:12,238 --> 01:00:14,605
Yeah, who's the winner, Bill?

945
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:16,607
Who is the winner?
No, I'm not going to shoot you.

946
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:18,576
I'm just fucking kidding.

947
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,780
Seriously, though, seriously.

948
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:23,782
Have you ever seen
a fucking cowboy?

949
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:34,235
Fuck this kid.

950
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:35,670
Fucking..

951
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:50,652
<i>Hello!</i>

952
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,387
Evan.

953
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:55,389
I'm leaving.
I'm fucking leaving!

954
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,024
No, you're not, man.

955
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:58,192
Dude, you're taking
for fucking ever!

956
01:01:58,193 --> 01:02:00,060
I've had a lot of shit
to do today, okay?

957
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:03,131
It's been a fucked up afternoon.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

958
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:04,132
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

959
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:06,100
I've been wait..
Dude, I've been waiting.

960
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,635
10 minutes, my fucking ass.

961
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,704
I've been waiting here for
fucking 45 minutes.

962
01:02:09,705 --> 01:02:12,073
Paintball. Paintball.
Paintball, bro.

963
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:12,990
So?

964
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,909
<i>We're going to play paintball.</i>

965
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,095
<i>Give me a fucking good reason..</i>

966
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:19,764
and I want a fucking articulate
reason.. why I should stay.

967
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:20,899
<i>Why should I stay?</i>

968
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,218
I'm going to fucking
kill you, man.

969
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,419
Listen, you're the one..
You're going to be needing

970
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,754
some fucking target practice,
all right?

971
01:02:27,055 --> 01:02:29,824
<i>You're not going to
go anywhere, right?</i>

972
01:02:30,325 --> 01:02:32,192
<i>Just stay there for
10 minutes, okay?</i>

973
01:02:32,193 --> 01:02:34,595
<i>I'm coming. I promise.
I love you, man.</i>

974
01:02:34,596 --> 01:02:35,930
<i>All right. I'll see you soon.</i>

975
01:02:35,931 --> 01:02:37,081
Okay.
Bye.

976
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:58,019
We can go a little faster, Ray.

977
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,631
Closer, Ray.

978
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,790
Shit.

979
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:27,191
Bump him.

980
01:06:26,478 --> 01:06:28,045
This is Sheriff Malvoy.

981
01:06:28,046 --> 01:06:29,614
I'm at the roundabout
in the County Park.

982
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,215
I've got 2 more deputies down.

983
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:33,384
I'm pursuing the suspect on foot.

984
01:07:42,053 --> 01:07:44,021
You got blood on me.

985
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:58,135
60 to 80 seconds.

986
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:56,861
You ready?

987
01:08:56,862 --> 01:08:58,529
What the fuck?

988
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,230
Is that what you took
2 fucking hours doing?

989
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:02,800
I'm glad you
didn't leave, buddy.

990
01:09:02,801 --> 01:09:04,802
I brought you a gift.

991
01:09:09,307 --> 01:09:10,775
What the fuck?

992
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:11,776
Check it out.

993
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,878
Dude!

994
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:15,613
Dude, this is real money.

995
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:18,415
It's a shit-load of money.

996
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:22,019
Where the fuck did you get all
of this fucking money?

997
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,287
Hey, Evan?

998
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:24,856
Yeah?

999
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:26,023
Check it out.

1000
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:32,329
You all right?

1001
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,765
Give me your hand.

1002
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:38,669
Hold this. Hold this.

1003
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,772
You kind of asked
for it, right?

1004
01:09:41,773 --> 01:09:44,174
I kind of made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1005
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:08,201
You are a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

1006
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:10,554
We'd like you to..

1007
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:13,340
Stop having these things
sent to my fucking house.

1008
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,175
Last ones, man.

1009
01:12:15,176 --> 01:12:16,810
You're making me pay
for my own post education.

1010
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:18,929
I've been waiting
for fucking 45 minutes.

1011
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:21,681
I made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1012
01:12:21,682 --> 01:12:24,735
Okay, sweetie.
I love you. Be safe.

1013
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:29,139
You're going to pay for this!
Do you hear me?

1014
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,742
What do you think I want?
Come on, quick.

1015
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,345
Money! Money! Money!

1016
01:12:34,346 --> 01:12:36,864
I don't know.
My name is Evan Drince.

1017
01:12:36,865 --> 01:12:38,782
Do you have any thoughts?

1018
01:12:38,783 --> 01:12:40,784
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything!

1019
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,889
Dozens of Centerville
residents and police officers

1020
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,925
earlier today, during what can
only be described

1021
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:24,278
as a massacre.

1022
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,847
The rampage began with
a massive explosion

1023
01:13:26,848 --> 01:13:28,132
that destroyed Centerville
police station.

1024
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:31,501
God, honey.
There you are, sweetheart.

1025
01:13:31,502 --> 01:13:32,752
This is just so awful.

1026
01:13:32,753 --> 01:13:35,989
I'm so glad you're here.

1027
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,359
You're okay, though, yeah?

1028
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,028
I'm so glad you
weren't out in this. This was..

1029
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:43,364
Are you okay, Bill?

1030
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:44,598
You were back here
when this started?

1031
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,667
I drove by the bakery,

1032
01:13:46,668 --> 01:13:48,369
and the whole glass was
shattered out of the bakery.

1033
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,536
This is the forest.

1034
01:13:49,537 --> 01:13:52,906
Look, this is where
they found the guy.

1035
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:53,907
They found the shooter already?

1036
01:13:53,908 --> 01:13:54,941
Yeah.

1037
01:13:54,942 --> 01:13:55,942
Wait a second.
One guy did all of this?

1038
01:13:55,943 --> 01:13:57,511
It was Evan.

1039
01:13:57,512 --> 01:14:00,447
Evan got shot?
Did Evan get shot?

1040
01:14:00,448 --> 01:14:04,034
No, Mom. Evan did it.
My friend, Evan.

1041
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,469
My God.

1042
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:07,304
Shot all of the..?

1043
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:09,940
Have they announced his name or
you just recognized him?

1044
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:12,008
They just said it,
Evan Drince, Evan Drince.

1045
01:14:12,009 --> 01:14:14,578
Breaking news.
Unbelievable.

1046
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:17,380
How did they find him? Like,
what? Did he give himself up?

1047
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:18,882
They just found
him in the woods.

1048
01:14:18,883 --> 01:14:20,417
He shot himself in the head.

1049
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:21,618
He's dead?

1050
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:24,387
He committed suicide.
He committed suicide.

1051
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:26,056
This is insane.

1052
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:27,458
This world is a crazy place,
isn't it?

1053
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:29,159
He was a fucked up kid.

1054
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:32,880
I thought he was..
I thought he was a bit odd,

1055
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:34,547
but I didn't think
he was a..

1056
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:36,466
Psychopath?

1057
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:38,535
He looked like he had secrets.

1058
01:14:38,536 --> 01:14:40,537
I mean, I'm just
an armchair psychologist,

1059
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:42,907
but a mother knows.

1060
01:14:42,908 --> 01:14:45,042
Like, you just intuit.

1061
01:14:45,043 --> 01:14:46,410
Yeah.

1062
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:49,363
Nevertheless, it must be a shock
for his parents.

1063
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:50,964
Have you spoken to them?

1064
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:52,532
Yeah.

1065
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,767
I don't even want to ask you

1066
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:55,235
about the college
applications now.

1067
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:59,923
It all seems
so trite, I guess.

1068
01:14:59,924 --> 01:15:01,591
I'm glad you guys
are okay, right?

1069
01:15:01,592 --> 01:15:04,092
Yeah.
We're fine.

1070
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,280
Presently, the only
thing we know..

1071
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:09,182
This is where I drove by.

1072
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,451
I told you I saw
that poor woman.

1073
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:13,153
Do you think
it's Mrs. Blakeslee?

1074
01:15:13,154 --> 01:15:15,989
I didn't want to stay around
long enough to find out?

1075
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,791
Guys, I'm so tired.
I'm going to go to sleep.

1076
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:20,261
Of course, honey.

1077
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:21,662
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

1078
01:15:21,663 --> 01:15:23,130
I'm really sorry.

1079
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:29,570
You give us a shout if
you need anything, okay?

1080
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,371
All right.
Take care, guys.

1081
01:15:31,372 --> 01:15:32,806
Get some sleep.

1082
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:34,408
Yeah, sweetheart. Bye-bye.

1083
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:36,810
I think he's
holding it in.

1084
01:15:36,811 --> 01:15:38,912
Maybe we should take
him to see somebody.

1085
01:15:38,913 --> 01:15:40,581
Well, for sure after this.

1086
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,082
He's going to have
to go talk to someone.

1087
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,118
Yeah.

1088
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:46,920
Just, I don't want anyone to
know that we're taking him.

1089
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:48,388
Yeah, fair enough.

1090
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:50,190
I don't want people to know and
think he's crazy or something.

1091
01:15:50,191 --> 01:15:52,859
My God.
This is awful.

1092
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,628
Let's have a drink or something?

1093
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:57,598
Yeah, make me a
double, something.

1094
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:00,817
Stay tuned to this station
for an update of this tragic story

1095
01:16:00,818 --> 01:16:02,953
as more details
become available.

1096
01:16:24,809 --> 01:16:27,377
Centerville resident
Lloyd Drince,

1097
01:16:27,378 --> 01:16:30,898
the father of Evan Drince
was arrested at his home

1098
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:32,750
when local authorities

1099
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:35,018
attempted to enter the
premises.

1100
01:16:35,019 --> 01:16:38,355
Close sources reveal that Lloyd
Drince used to be a radical

1101
01:16:38,356 --> 01:16:43,326
and extreme protester
in the '60s and '70s,

1102
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:46,029
especially at the height
of the war in Vietnam

1103
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,665
and has always been
strongly outspoken

1104
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,734
against the government.

1105
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,971
With the current evidence that
his son, Evan Drince,

1106
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:56,907
has been identified as being
behind the massacre

1107
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:59,276
in downtown Centerville today,

1108
01:16:59,277 --> 01:17:01,611
it appears that
radical measures

1109
01:17:01,612 --> 01:17:05,315
to get your opinions
out runs in the family.

1110
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:08,051
To recap, the offender
has been identified

1111
01:17:08,052 --> 01:17:12,589
as 21-year-old Centerville
resident Evan Drince,

1112
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,726
who took his own life
in a nearby forested area

1113
01:17:15,727 --> 01:17:17,729
after completing his
destruction and killing spree.

1114
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,664
You've got the wrong kid!
My kid wouldn't do this!

1115
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:22,432
My kid's innocent!

1116
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:24,134
Bill Williamson!

1117
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:28,071
Bill Williamson did this!

1118
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:30,440
Check Bill Williamson's house!

1119
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:34,544
My kid is not a murderer!

1120
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:37,981
My son is innocent!
Bill Williamson!

1121
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:40,434
The authorities have not
pressed any charges

1122
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:44,137
or revealed information
about suspects

1123
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:46,807
since they feel a thorough
investigation is needed..

1124
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:57,733
It's a..

1125
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:02,639
It's a downward spiral

1126
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,576
to the end of all times.

1127
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:10,813
And there's no chance
that we can survive.

1128
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:15,102
I mean..
70 million people every year

1129
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:17,054
are brought onto this Earth.

1130
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:19,888
What are they doing?
Sucking up our resources.

1131
01:18:20,157 --> 01:18:23,060
There's too many people,
so what do we do?

1132
01:18:23,461 --> 01:18:25,295
Just keep them around?

1133
01:18:25,296 --> 01:18:26,897
Let's kill them.

1134
01:18:26,898 --> 01:18:29,166
Let's get rid of them.

1135
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,634
Good, thank you.

1136
01:18:30,635 --> 01:18:32,903
Thanks for..
thanks for coming out.

1137
01:18:32,904 --> 01:18:34,405
But you know what?

1138
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:36,473
We're at capacity.

1139
01:18:36,474 --> 01:18:37,607
We're at capacity now.

1140
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:41,011
So.. sorry, no more.

1141
01:18:41,012 --> 01:18:42,546
No more.

1142
01:18:42,547 --> 01:18:44,898
So that's what I'll do.

1143
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:46,867
Why not?

1144
01:18:46,868 --> 01:18:48,469
That's my plan.

1145
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,003
That's what I want to do.

1146
01:18:50,004 --> 01:18:53,006
Let's just clean the world,

1147
01:18:53,007 --> 01:18:56,477
so maybe the rest of us can
sustain a little bit of life.

1148
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:02,900
So maybe that's what
I'll do in the future.

1149
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:05,702
I'll help you out.

1150
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:07,304
I'll help you out,

1151
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:09,914
and I will cleanse,

1152
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:14,144
make more room for you.

1153
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:19,015
I will exhibit my own brand of
population control..

1154
01:19:19,016 --> 01:19:21,017
for you.

1155
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:25,955
That's it.

1156
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,300
