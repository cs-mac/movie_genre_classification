1
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,429
      It's Thursday,
      December 29th.

2
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,164
      We left the hotel
      about an hour ago

3
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,199
  and everyone's sleeping.

4
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,702
  But I... I can't...
  I can't sleep because...

5
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,639
          See that?

6
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,408
          Surprise.

7
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,587
  Ah... That's your daddy.
  That's the best daddy.

8
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,923
  Look at him.
  Say, "Hi, Daddy".

9
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,627
- The van.
- Hmm?

10
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,794
Stop the van!
  Stop the van!

11
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,900
Yeah. Let it go!

12
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,469
Whoa! Yeah, bro!

13
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,905
Oh, get it all out!
  Get it all out.
You okay?

14
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,173
  You okay?

15
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,408
- That is disgusting.
- I'm fine.

16
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,710
  It's making my eyes water.
  It smells like straight
  whiskey.

17
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,681
  Some nice greasy
  hangover food will
  be good for you.

18
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,417
Come on.
Yeah, let's get
  some hangover food.

19
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,885
Mmm-mmm-mmm...

20
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:07,886
Oh! Round two!

21
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,591
This is all
                    my fault.
Well done.

22
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,959
                Shut up!

23
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,795
Oh, yeah, man.
  Eat them beans.

24
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,364
  Beans and rice
  mixing together...
    Are you serious?

25
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,599
...having a party
  in that stomach.

26
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,401
          Are you serious?

27
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,204
  Are you kidding me?
  Make a web series out of this.

28
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,939
              Just stop, man.

29
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,874
      "Cole Pukes.
      The Untold Story."
               Mark, cut it out.

30
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,242
Why?
  Give me a little spirit.
  Why not?

31
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,411
                Would you stop?
          What? It's...

32
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,248
      It's annoying.
      You're being obnoxious.
      Stop filming!

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,749
You're looking over
        our little dossier?

34
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,852
- Yeah, yeah, I'm actually...
- Evil awaits us, huh?

35
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,754
        Turn off the fucking
        camera, Mark!

36
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,290
  Dude, chill.
  And your eyes are beautiful.

37
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,359
Give me the camera!
          Give me the camera.

38
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,562
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Dude! Dude,
  you'll hurt the camera!

39
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,666
    Sorry, I just gotta tell ya,
      my wife and I are such
      big fans of your show.

40
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,968
- Huge fans.
- Thank you very much.

41
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,903
    We have your entire
    first season on DVD.

42
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,841
    I don't know how you guys,
    you know, go into all those
    places and spend the night.

43
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,410
       I get scared in the dark!

44
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,279
      I don't mean to be nosy,
      but what are you guys
      doing here?

45
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,914
      Are you going up
      to Hillcrest?

46
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,923
Look at you, baby.

47
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,826
            Baby, where are you?
            There you are.

48
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:21,994
Hi.

49
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,570
Hmm...

50
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,372
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

51
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,606
                So, how'd it go
                with Mark?

52
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,943
    Oh, I think
    we're all good.

53
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,611
            Yeah, it went okay?

54
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,746
        Yeah.

55
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,848
              Good. That's good.

56
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,586
          I don't care. If we
          don't get anything,
          we don't get anything.

57
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,455
        If they cancel the show,
          that's no big deal.

58
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,923
        I just want it to be...

59
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,661
              I want to be real.

60
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,929
You gotta
        stop worrying about it.
        Okay?

61
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,433
                    All right.
                           Okay?

62
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,669
                  Yeah. Yeah,
                I'm not, just...

63
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,804
                      Just what?

64
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,609
    Just 100 episodes
    into a hit television show?

65
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,446
            Oh, I'm so worried,
            so worried.

66
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,617
        It's amazing.
       Hey, oh! A big part of...

67
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,487
You look so stupid!

68
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,623
                He does not!
  You're like a chipmunk!

69
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,826
  Well, he says
  whatever he wants.
  He looks like an asshole.

70
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,094
Oh, my God,
  he's gonna choke.

71
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,730
  This is where you
  start getting stuck.
  Thank you very much.

72
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,398
          Oh, my God!
  Oh, no!

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,003
Seven, six, five, four,
  three, two, one!

74
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,771
  No! Open your mouth.
  Open your mouth.

75
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,406
  Open it, open it, open it.
  Open your mouth.
          Oh, my God!

76
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,875
All right.

77
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,077
    Whoo!

78
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,846
  That deserves
  a nice handshake.
              Wow!

79
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,849
      Hey, either way,
    the pretzels were delicious.

80
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,518
  Yeah, okay, I don't want to
  pay for anything tonight.

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,488
Well, come on,
            you're $100 richer.

82
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,590
        Yeah. Another round.
                        Barkeep!

83
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,425
            Barkeep! Barkeep!
            You can't say that.

84
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,495
                    Ready?

85
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,796
  Why would you be
  able to twist your arm
  all the way around?

86
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,898
    Oh, my God!
              Ew! Ew! Ew!

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,835
You got this, Cole?
            You got that? Yeah!
Nope, nope, nope.

88
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,737
  Humans shouldn't
  have to do that.

89
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,638
          Guys, I can do...
    Oh, my God!

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,775
Oh, no, no,
                no, no, no!

91
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,944
  Who wants to kiss me?
          There we go.

92
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,879
Bare skin.
Oh,
    there's the Wolfman!

93
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,583
  Ow! That hurts so good!

94
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,451
            All right, you're
            eating that pretzel.

95
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,487
  I'll give you $75 to
  eat that pretzel.

96
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,155
  I'm sorry I called
  you a barkeep.

97
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,566
      This is <i> GhostTrackers,</i>
      episode 100,
      Hillcrest Sanatorium.

98
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,835
            Camera A. Camera B.

99
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,738
        All right, I'm rolling.

100
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,842
                        Hey, Ty.
                  Yeah.

101
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,778
          As you can see,
          we are packing up
          for what is sure to be

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,847
        one of the most
        exciting investigations
        we have ever done.

103
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,049
        The location we're
        going to is shrouded

104
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,986
        with so much
        secrecy and lore

105
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,523
    that we're pretty sure
    we're in store for
    one heck of a night.

106
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:08,160
  Yeah! We're the lucky bastards
  that get to go in first!

107
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,095
Oh, shit!

108
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,731
            All right,
           let's watch it, guys.

109
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,666
God, I wanna get there.
Did we
  pass a Stoney...

110
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,702
- A Stoney Hill... Lane?
- A Stoney Hill...

111
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,204
               Stoney Hill Lane?

112
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,139
Stoney Hill Lane?
   They're all stony hill lanes.

113
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,841
The phone
                fucking keeps
                freezing, man.

114
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:23,842
Man,
            it's all our phones.

115
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:29,781
    Okay, so, Sam, why don't
    you tell us and our viewers
    what's going on?

116
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,484
        Well, what's going on is
        we are currently lost,

117
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:36,521
  which is a little embarrassing
  as we are obviously

118
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,156
      a van full of people
    who can find the paranormal,

119
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,193
            but no one can read
            a fricking map!

120
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,829
        It happens even to us.
        Sometimes we get lost,

121
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,898
      but these places are
      in the middle of nowhere.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,734
All right,
  so can you tell us
  why we're still lost?

123
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,536
  What's going on right now?

124
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,138
Lost.

125
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,975
  Sometimes you have to let
  a spirit guide you.

126
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,011
  I don't know, I think the
  scariest places should be
  the most difficult to find.

127
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,547
  That's how I feel
  personally, so...
                           Guys!

128
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,249
    What?
                    I found it.

129
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,818
Got it?
                       Let's go!

130
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,687
                      Come on.
      Spirit probably told her.

131
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,590
              It's fucking cold.
              Let's go!
  Probably came in... Okay.

132
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,891
          Found it. That's done.
                   Yeah, I know.
                    We got that.

133
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,528
Wow!

134
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,929
Oh, boy.

135
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,099
  All right, that's it.
  It looks...

136
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,502
  ...pretty creepy,
  like we thought it would.

137
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,237
  This is a big one for us.

138
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:29,040
- This is like our Super Bowl.
- This place is famous.

139
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,143
Oh, my God.
            Do you see it's
            all boarded up?

140
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:35,814
That's Irwin.
That's Irwin, the guy
  who set this all up for us.

141
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:36,982
Oh, my God,
  it's amazing.

142
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,619
Irwin?
        Yeah, I'm Irwin.

143
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,687
Hey,
  we're the GhostTrackers.

144
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,023
    I know who you guys are.
    I watched your show.

145
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,125
          I watched just
          the beginning of it.

146
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,994
        You're Tyler, right?
  That's me.

147
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,562
              Hey, I'm Irwin.
              How are ya?
  Hey, thanks so much.

148
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,898
        Samantha.
                Sam, you know me
                 from the phone.

149
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,200
      Yes. Cole. How are ya?
      What's cooking?
  Sir. Really good.

150
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,069
  Hey. Mark, crack him up.
  Oh, man, pleasure.
  Hey, yeah. Oh, thanks, man.

151
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,938
    How are you? The one
    with the jokes and the
    wisecracks, yeah.

152
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,241
    Oh, Bridge, how are you?
    How are you?
                      Good.

153
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,709
    Always with the equipment
    and stuff like that.

154
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,011
      Great to meet you.
          Welcome, you guys.

155
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,612
              This is, like,
             a part of the show?

156
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,581
Yeah. Yeah,
     you're on camera right now.

157
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,918
          Hey, Irwin, we're real
          excited to get inside
          the Sanatorium, so...

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,621
        Sanatorium, technically,
          it's now the Hillcrest
          Nursing Home.

159
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:20,125
      The Sanatorium closed down
      years and years ago.

160
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,027
           Then it was abandoned
            for a couple years.
  Uh-huh.

161
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,930
              Then, around 1974,
            some people came in.

162
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,265
      They renovated the inside
      and they made it
      a nursing home.

163
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,968
        It's the
        Hillcrest Nursing Home,
        so technically,

164
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,804
        you're looking
        at the abandoned
        Hillcrest Nursing Home.

165
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,041
Well, you think we
  can get inside,
  take a quick look or...

166
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,910
Front door's locked.
    There's a padlock.

167
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,079
    I can't find the key.
    We can't get in today.

168
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,847
  I got a guy coming tomorrow

169
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:46,318
  with one of those hydraulic
  power bolt cutter things.

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,820
  We can cut
  the bolt on the door.
  So we can get in tomorrow.

171
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,755
What if we get,
  like, a state trooper
  or something

172
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,957
  just to, like,
  shotgun it open?

173
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,658
No, no, no, no, no.

174
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,226
- Look around today.
- I appreciate it, man.

175
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,195
- Don't break nothing.
- I'm not...

176
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,663
      If you break something,
      I'm a ghost, 'cause
      I'm dead meat.

177
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,098
All right. Yeah.
              Yeah.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,267
No, man,
  I don't want you
  haunting me, Irwin.

179
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,770
What? Oh, my God,
  it's happening.

180
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,006
You're the man.
  You're the man. Okay.
All right.

181
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,341
You're the strong man.
  Okay?
I am big.

182
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,208
Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,728
All right,
  yep, and in...

184
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,329
  And there we go.

185
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,833
  What are you...
  What are you zooming in on?

186
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,868
The window.
  It's a scary window.
I know it's the...

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,704
No, it's not scary.
  It's the same shot
  we always get, man.

188
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,206
It's a pretty
  scary window, man.

189
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:46,111
  You're doing what we
  normally do. I want to
  do something different.

190
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,013
- Oh, shit.
- You got it.

191
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,167
  The sky's the limit, man.
  We can go anywhere with this.

192
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,336
  We're gonna... Why can't we
  have 10 million viewers?

193
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,873
  But that's what I'm saying.
  You have 1,800.

194
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,042
      I have 150,000.
      You need to step up
      your game, dude.

195
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,178
  Great, it's our 100th
  episode, that's 100...

196
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,947
    That means 100 fucking
    episodes of the same thing.
  Episode.

197
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,049
  Watch the DVD,
  you're gonna see
  the same shit.

198
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,250
                      Right.

199
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,719
Two more.

200
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,056
  What the fuck was that?
              Did you hear that?

201
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:35,293
Nursing home came and
  went before I started, uh,
  taking care of the property.

202
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,829
           That was '74, or '76.

203
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,131
               Before your time.
    Yeah, before I started
    taking care of the place.

204
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,434
           Didn't those two boys
            go missing a couple
            years ago?

205
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,304
  Nobody wants to talk about it.

206
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,007
      Between you and me
      and the grand piano,

207
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,743
  I don't think anything
  happened to them in there.

208
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,012
  I think they were just playing
  around somewhere,

209
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:58,383
  and some pedophile freak was
  passing through the area,
  scooped them up.

210
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,352
  If they were playing
  around this property,
  I would have known.

211
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,456
      This place is huge.
    I mean, you're only one man.
      You only have two eyes.

212
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,891
    I'm in charge of this place.
     I'm in charge of everything
      that comes and goes.

213
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,727
            I see what
            goes on here, okay?

214
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,161
              It's my job.
           Irwin, do you believe
            in ghosts?

215
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,463
  Do I believe in ghosts?

216
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,999
Yeah.

217
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,134
  I believe in ghosts.

218
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,204
  As far as this place, nah.

219
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,005
  This is just

220
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,409
  a dumpy old,
  scary old building.
  It's scary looking.

221
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,845
  You'll see what it's like.
  It's just a bunch of rooms.

222
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,383
    Let's check out this, uh...
    I saw this window here.

223
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,985
        What the hell?

224
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,987
Oh, hey, man.
    No, no, no, no.

225
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,455
Irwin's over there,
  so just keep it cool.

226
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,923
  All right.
    All right?

227
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,991
All right.

228
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,467
- You getting this?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,911
            All right,
           ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,013
  You're gonna get
  a little preview here.
  So, uh...

231
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,249
Watch the glass.
                  I know.

232
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,483
All right,
  go, go, go.

233
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,821
Oh! Jesus Christ!

234
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,491
    Mark, you weren't trying to
    go in there, were you?

235
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,060
No, man.
          Okay, deal's a deal.

236
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:19,164
  No, I got you, dude.
          Okay. You go in today,
          I lose my job.

237
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,199
  I got you, man.
  We were just
  taking a peek, that's all.

238
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,202
  All right. I will.
           Okay. You're the man.

239
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,137
                Fucking asshole.

240
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,174
                   Jesus Christ.

241
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,577
        "For our 100th episode,
        we will investigate
        claims of apparitions,

242
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,014
    "disembodied voices,
    and the apparent abductions
    that have happened here."

243
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,116
            How's that? Good?

244
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,350
I think that was perfect.

245
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,986
          All right, action.

246
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,823
  Just behind me is the
  infamous Hillcrest Sanatorium.

247
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,525
                Built in 1908...

248
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,194
- It's all right. Relax.
- Let's do it again.

249
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,529
            Just behind me
            is the infamous
           Hillcrest Sanatorium.

250
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,165
                  Oh, fuck me!

251
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,534
            With the discovery
            of antibio... Um...

252
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,137
                And, uh...

253
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,973
              Many died
              and went insane.

254
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,175
              Griz... Grizzly...

255
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,848
I'm guessing it's
  for the little kids or
  something like that,

256
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,016
            but we could
            probably spin it.

257
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,551
Right? About the patients
        that stayed here?
Yeah, that makes sense.

258
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,020
          Does that make sense?
          Cool.

259
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:20,124
      So, uh, Cole and I
      discovered these flowers
      left by family members

260
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,429
  of the poor souls that
  lost their lives here in
  this gruesome sanatorium.

261
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,498
    I think tonight,
    during our investigation,

262
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,535
  I'm going to be dedicating
  everything I can to...

263
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,304
  Hey, man. Wait, wait.
  Wait. Hold on, man.
  What? What?

264
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,473
There was something
  in the window.

265
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,475
What?
  There was something
  in that window.

266
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,245
  It looked like a...
  It looked like a little kid.

267
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,347
There was something...
There's a little kid
  in the window?

268
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,582
  There was something
  in the window. There was
  a kid in that window, man.

269
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,117
Okay. Get this.
  Get this then.

270
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,086
Hey, little kid!

271
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,388
  If you're in the window,
  show yourself!

272
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,656
Dude...
  No, man. Check the tape.

273
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,458
Dude,
  you're doing good, man.

274
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,926
  You don't have to
  ham it up here.

275
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,994
  I'm serious, man,
  there was a kid in there!

276
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,661
            Okay.

277
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,633
  <i> ...dedicating everything</i>
  <i> I can to...</i>

278
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,434
  <i> Wait, wait, wait...</i>
  <i> Hold on, man.</i>

279
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,402
Right there,
  right in the window,
  then it goes away.

280
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,503
          I see it.

281
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,472
No!

282
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,973
                 I think there's
                something there.

283
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,508
           It could be a shadow,
            but there's...

284
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,176
            There is something.
   There's definitely something.

285
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,146
          No, do it again.
          I didn't see anything.

286
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,282
  <i> ...dedicating everything</i>
  <i> I can to...</i>

287
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,284
  <i> Hey, man. Wait, wait, wait.</i>
  <i> Wait. Hold on, man.</i>
      <i> What?</i>

288
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,685
A little boy?
                Yeah!

289
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,054
Say you saw
  a monster or something.

290
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,089
   Well, maybe it was a monster.
    We'll find out when
    we get there, right?

291
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,524
I was there,
          I didn't see anything.

292
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,060
    Either way, it's definitely
    worth checking out.

293
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,496
              When we go inside,
              we'll have to...
              I don't know.

294
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,298
                Take a good look
               around that room.

295
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,566
                  Maybe see what
                we can draw out.

296
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,335
        Haven't even gone inside
          and we're already,

297
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,103
            maybe seeing things.

298
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,173
        Maybe it's our emotions
        getting the best of us.

299
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,174
            Either way,
           it's pretty exciting.

300
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,980
  All right, so it's 4:30 a.m.
  and I'm trying to stay up.

301
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,049
    We're all trying to stay up
    as long as possible.

302
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,319
  You know, so tomorrow night
  no one's slacking around
  or anything like that.

303
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,555
        But my buddy Cole
        is sleeping.

304
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,158
      Might need a little drink
      to wake him up. Hunh?

305
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,659
    A little wake up call. Hmm?

306
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,497
Hello, oh, hello.

307
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,166
Hey!

308
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,137
  Man, you're so...
            Really?

309
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,406
  Dude, don't break
  the camera, man.

310
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,241
              Jesus Christ, man.
              What the fuck?

311
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,311
                  Oh...

312
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,247
  Only one person who that
  could be at 4:30 a.m.

313
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,350
  Someone's getting ass...

314
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,352
            Hi!
  Why are you guys filming?

315
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:30,488
  Someone left something on,
  like, Tyler and Sam's door,

316
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,558
  It has to do with Hillcrest.
  We're in their room now.

317
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,692
Okay...

318
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,332
You guys want info
  on Hillcrest? Here it is.

319
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,534
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

320
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,103
And here he is.
    Richard Howl.

321
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,704
- Holy shit.
- What?

322
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,339
Wait, let me get this.
Oh, my God,
  this is great.

323
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,675
Wait. Hold up, Ty.

324
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,543
This was taken on
            New Year's Day?
Holy shit!

325
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,780
           Richard Howl murdered
            three children

326
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,749
        on New Year's Eve, 1955.

327
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,152
        He brutally murders
        the three kids
        and then hangs himself.

328
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,388
- Oh, my God.
- Yup.

329
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,257
  So, holiday party
  right before
  it all happened,

330
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,426
  three of these kids, dead.

331
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,627
How old were they?

332
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,230
11...
        The youngest one was 8.

333
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,631
              11, 11 and 8.
              Just little ones.

334
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,333
- Is that the police report?
- Can I get that?

335
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,502
Some of his ribs
  were removed.
What?

336
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,437
And it's actually
  like this.
It's that way?

337
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,539
  Part of this lung is gone.

338
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,775
What the...
Wait.
  Why did they do that?

339
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,277
  He had TB and he was
  getting experimented on.

340
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,779
What?
Yes,
  Hillcrest was kind of...

341
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,049
From here it says
    that they would do...

342
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,617
            Yeah, exactly, Cole.
              Experiments.

343
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,218
         It was like the patient
        had nothing to live for.

344
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,219
Fourteen people
  in a room? Jesus.

345
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,188
  I'm just really scared.

346
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,690
          I don't want to
          go tomorrow.

347
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,293
  Well, it's just gonna
  get scarier.
      I think it's really scary.

348
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,195
I didn't know the kids
        were so young.
This is what we do.

349
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,230
  This is what we do.
    I didn't think it was
    real, guys. I'm sorry.

350
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,532
                  Don't worry.
                  I'll be there.

351
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,666
          You guys are in
          for such a treat.

352
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,401
  I cannot wait for tomorrow.

353
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,171
      Is it tomorrow yet?
    Technically, it is tomorrow.

354
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,273
              Technically,
              we're about to go!

355
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,076
                        Whoo!

356
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,344
      And, uh...

357
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,413
  It's on the anniversary
  that he hung himself.

358
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,491
- Wow.
- There it is. Yes.

359
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,193
    The Hillcrest Sanatorium.

360
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,631
Oh, come on.

361
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,433
He's wearing different
  clothes than yesterday.

362
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,701
                      Great.

363
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,336
  The last thing
  I said to him,

364
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,704
  I specifically said,
  "Please wear
  the same clothes".

365
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,772
Awesome.

366
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:32,343
      I kinda plowed earlier
      before you guys came.

367
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,445
  A little bit, not plowed,
  but I kinda stomped it down.

368
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,251
        I'm ready to go in,
        you ready to go in?
                    Let's do it.

369
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,419
                  Okay.

370
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,553
  You all over 18, right?

371
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,857
            Most of us. Yeah.

372
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:49,427
  Okay. Ready?
  Here we go.

373
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,596
      Might be a couple of rats,
      but don't worry.

374
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,631
  Okay, there's a lot
  of water here.
  Might be some ice.

375
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,147
        Now, the Sanatorium
        was built in 1908

376
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,683
  as just a wellness center
  for people
  in the countryside.

377
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,553
  It was supposed to have
  about 30 patients.

378
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,855
          Then, when the
          white plague hit,

379
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,492
  there was well over 500 people
  in here at any given time.

380
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,429
    Just squeezed in every nook
    and cranny in the facility.

381
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,198
                  It was a very,
                 very sad place.

382
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,767
       People from all over were
        trying to get in here.

383
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,570
So, how many people
  were still stuck here?

384
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,238
        About 1,000 people
        died in here.

385
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,873
What?

386
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,410
1,000 people
  died here in five years.

387
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,481
During the height of
  the plague, this was
  the draining room.

388
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,684
        When somebody would die
        from their tuberculosis

389
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,352
            and at the peak
            of the plague,

390
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,321
            that was happening,
            like, every day,

391
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,523
          they would take
          the dead bodies and
          there were poles here,

392
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,725
        and they would hang
       the bodies by their neck.

393
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,662
        but just, you know,
        keep them up from here.

394
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,931
      And they would make
    an incision from the sternum

395
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,366
            all the way down
            to the groin

396
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,436
      so that all the fluids
    in the body would drain out.

397
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,605
      Back then they didn't know
      and they thought

398
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:11,576
          by removing the fluids
         before they shipped the
        bodies out for disposal,

399
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,745
            they could contain
            the infection to
            the facility. Okay?

400
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:15,947
                  Bridget?
                        Yes.

401
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,249
    We should set up
    a static camera right here.

402
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,451
                  All right.
  I want to get full
  coverage of this room.

403
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,553
- Okay.
- Oh, guys. Guys.

404
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,225
            Ooh...

405
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,627
  I feel a lot of
  static energy right here.

406
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,462
      Right here.

407
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,564
  It's pulling me in.

408
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,366
- Irwin, come here.
- What?

409
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,467
        Feel this.

410
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,835
  Put your hands here.
  You feel that?

411
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,305
  Nah, man.

412
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,506
  What are you talking about?
  It's right here.

413
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,609
  Nah, nothing there.

414
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,978
  This is its origin, here.
  Right here.

415
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,950
During the
  nursing home period,
  this was...

416
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,486
   As you might be able to tell,
    this was the kitchen.

417
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:59,023
  You know, stoves,
  ovens, sinks.

418
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,659
  But before that,
  this exact same room,

419
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,361
  back in the Sanatorium days,

420
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,863
        was the autopsy room
        in the morgue.

421
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,565
What?
                  Yeah.

422
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,734
So we're talking
  a lot of bodies
  in this room.

423
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:15,673
  A lot of people who went
  through probably horribly
  traumatic deaths.

424
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,874
        And this is where
        they were stored.

425
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,743
      This is where
      they were dissected.

426
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,418
            Tyler! Come in here.
              Feel this.

427
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,954
    It's like 20 degrees colder
    in here than in there.

428
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,456
  It's freezing in here.
          It's freezing in here.

429
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,724
          Cole, get in here!

430
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,996
          It's definitely...
          It's noticeably colder
          in this room.

431
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,432
This place is evil.

432
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,468
  Anybody else's limbs
  hurt right now?

433
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,039
Like my limbs, like my elbows
  and all my joints, right?
Yeah.

434
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,641
          Between you and me,
          I think it's just cold
          'cause it's winter.

435
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,009
                      You know?
      Yeah.

436
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,630
       Watch out for hoses here.
        There's a lot of...

437
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,435
Whoa!
          Jesus Christ! Fuck me!

438
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,936
        It's all right.
       It's just something fell.

439
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:22,406
What'd you see, Mark?
               Oh! I don't know.

440
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,941
What fell?
          Let's get the fuck
          out of here.

441
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,843
This doesn't feel safe, guys.

442
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,822
       So he was right up there?

443
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,890
  Yeah. Right up there where
  the plaster's missing.

444
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,593
        That crazy light
        wasn't there back then,
        but they came in

445
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,795
    and found him dangling right
      from that spot there.

446
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,134
      I know you can hear us,
      Richard Howl.

447
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:53,104
    I know you're
    watching us right now.
    I can feel you.

448
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,939
        You did that
        to those kids, Richard?

449
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,940
            You did that
            to those kids?

450
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:59,777
        Try that on me.
        Try that on me!

451
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,912
Okay. Uh...

452
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,581
- I think we can cut?
- Let's do it.

453
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,982
- Dick Howl.
- Real tough, Mark.

454
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,953
All right.
  Action!

455
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,890
          This is the room where
          the infamous patient
          Richard Howl lived.

456
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,460
      Richard suffered
      from a severe strain
      of tuberculosis

457
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,563
          which slowly consumed
          him from within.

458
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:24,502
        He unfortunately
        volunteered for many
        experimental surgeries.

459
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,105
     These surgeries would later
      drive him completely mad.

460
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,175
    He had eight rib cage bones
    removed from his chest

461
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,444
              and one of
            his lungs collapsed.

462
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,814
          It was in this room
          on New Year's Eve,

463
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:40,050
            December 31st, 1955,

464
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,119
            that Richard
            took his own life

465
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:45,890
    after brutally bludgeoning
    three children to death

466
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,825
        while they were
        sleeping in their beds.

467
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,554
This is where
              they were killed.

468
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,888
Irwin.

469
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,525
        Don't sneak up
        on me like that.
            Sorry.

470
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,028
                 The three kids,
                viciously beaten
                  in this room.

471
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,072
  What happened in here
  creeps me out
  when I'm by myself.

472
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,215
       This is definitely a room
        that we gotta stay in.

473
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,220
I want you guys
  to be extra careful.

474
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,222
    It is really, really
    dark down here.

475
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,963
      That is what was called
      "The Passage to Paradise".

476
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,967
  Dead bodies on gurneys were
  rolled through this maze
  for waiting hearses.

477
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,503
  The doctors were thinking
  it would stop the spread
  of infection.

478
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,905
  It also would have
  relieve the patients
  from seeing death.

479
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,141
This is a sad place.

480
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,611
It is really dark
    down here.

481
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,112
      Actually,
      let's turn off our lights

482
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,848
      to show you guys
     just how dark it really is.

483
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,586
      Get 'em all off.

484
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,624
Ladies and gentlemen,
  this is what we see
  when the lights go out.

485
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,693
    And we can only see the LCD
    screens on these cameras.

486
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,029
      Infrared.

487
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,130
      No infrared.

488
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,566
    Infrared.

489
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,934
    No infrared.

490
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,869
  Infrared.

491
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,971
      No infrared.

492
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,978
- That's pretty dark.
- Told ya.

493
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,017
        That concludes the tour.

494
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,653
Sorry. No gift shop.

495
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,888
- We can't thank you enough.
- Yeah, thanks, Irwin.

496
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,657
- It's been amazing.
- We appreciate it.

497
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,026
          Anything for you guys.

498
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:05,596
  Just put that thing as
  far away as possible.
  I don't want to hear it.

499
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,007
      So, these are
      motion detectors.

500
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,311
  If any mass or energy passes
  through, an alarm will sound.

501
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,820
                Okay.

502
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,163
Hmm?

503
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,964
  Hillcrest Sanatorium.
  Everything's getting set up.

504
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,769
  The sun's about to go down

505
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,137
      and things are
      about to get wild.

506
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,832
          Oh, fuck!

507
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,413
  I feel like
  I just got tripped.

508
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:05,015
  There's nothing around that
  could have tripped me.

509
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,887
        Maybe it was myself.

510
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,388
I don't know.
      Could have been.

511
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,856
      But I don't think so.

512
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,125
  Anybody here
  trying to freak me out?

513
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,860
  Trying to scare me
  out of here?

514
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,698
  You're gonna have to do
  better than that.

515
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,810
             I'm all alone here.

516
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,278
            Nobody else is here.
           There's nothing here.

517
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,081
       But I ate it pretty hard.

518
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,052
      Gonna be sore tomorrow.

519
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,242
                   What is that?

520
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,846
                           Guys?

521
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,216
                          Hello?

522
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,452
                          Guys?

523
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,088
Fuck!

524
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,858
          Found a bowling ball.

525
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,226
          Fucking asshole.
          Why would you do that?

526
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,101
    It's New Year's Eve night.

527
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,904
   56 years since Richard Howl's
    brutal rampage.

528
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,039
      We're here at the
      Hillcrest Sanatorium,

529
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,877
      about to enter, record
      and document some of
      the strange phenomena

530
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,245
    that has been reported here.

531
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,248
      Any last words for us?

532
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,116
               Happy New Year's.

533
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,317
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Irwin.

534
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,185
           Thank you. Thank you.

535
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,887
            All right.

536
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,191
          So our cameras
          are all set up.

537
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,392
          We've got this
          whole place covered.

538
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,027
    We've got the kitchen.

539
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,563
      We've got every hallway,
      the children's wing.

540
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,899
     We've got outside in front.

541
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,334
          We've also got
          motion detectors
          in Howl's room,

542
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,871
        the children's wing,
        and there's also one
        right behind me

543
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,874
       so that Mark doesn't pull
        a single thing.

544
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,577
        Thank you, Bridget.
        We've got a great
        opportunity here

545
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,814
     to capture some really good
      activity in this building.

546
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,048
      Let's break up into teams.

547
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,149
        Sam and I are
        gonna be one team.

548
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,351
      And of course,
      Mark and Cole another.

549
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,354
    Bridget's gonna stay here
   and monitor all our activity.

550
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,223
            Let's do this, guys.
              One, two, three...

551
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,191
Lights out!

552
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,593
                      Let's go!

553
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,161
Okay.

554
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,897
Night vision on, guys.

555
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,622
Oh, careful!

556
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,991
                    Damn it.

557
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,326
Watch your step, okay?

558
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:13,230
  A lot of boards with
  nails in 'em. Watch out.

559
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:14,064
All right.
              Copy that.

560
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,004
Set.

561
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,308
  This is an EMF detector.

562
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,578
      Ghosts, spirits,
      they're said to give off
      electromagnetic energy.

563
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,281
      If one gets close to me,
      this is gonna spike.

564
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,458
        Any people who were
        tortured in here,
       we're not gonna hurt you.

565
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,963
        Just come close to us.

566
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,284
      We don't try to
      just spice things up.

567
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,320
  If I'm not picking
  up anything,
  there's nothing in here.

568
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,288
  Sometimes that happens.

569
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,458
      I'm Mark, this is Cole.

570
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,461
     We're about to descend down
     to the Passage to Paradise.

571
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,096
    Start our investigation.

572
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,097
            Here we go.

573
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,773
          Oh, dude,
          it smells so bad.

574
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,213
        This is gross.

575
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,085
There's
  water on the ground.
  That's nice.

576
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,461
  What's going on in here?

577
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,733
  Yeah, this is...
  I'd live here.

578
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,340
      Jesus.

579
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,247
            Dude!
    Oh, Jesus Christ!

580
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,416
    Dude, dude, dude!
    Shut up! Come on.
    Over here.

581
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,784
Jesus!

582
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,553
What the fuck?

583
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,156
                   What is this?

584
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,257
Look at the wall.

585
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,691
What the fuck is that?

586
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,193
          There's just drawings.

587
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,295
They're people
  on the wall.

588
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:29,232
Looks like a dragon
        about to attack a devil
        holding a baby.

589
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,334
            Look at that.
            Look at the dragon.
  Right.

590
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,836
Oh, look at
            the baby flying out.

591
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,604
Holy shit!
  That is that.

592
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,674
  It's fucking...

593
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:38,842
There's just
          one singular bathroom.

594
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,645
Gross.

595
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,083
What the fuck?
      What is that?

596
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,285
                   What is that?

597
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,657
      What did we just see?
      What did we just see?

598
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,158
          Look at it.
          Go down, go down.

599
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,427
  Ready? And, hello.

600
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,829
Oh...

601
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,702
This is Tyler and Samantha.

602
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,306
      We're in the dining room
     headed towards the kitchen.

603
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,267
Do you hear that?

604
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,836
              No, what?

605
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,141
I thought...

606
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,844
    Nothing, forget about it.
    It's nothing.

607
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,233
- Dude, dude!
- What? What?

608
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:12,369
Shit! Shit! Shit!
                    What?

609
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,571
  There's a big spider!
  Spider up... Spider!

610
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,473
  There's a spider over here?
    Dude, there's a spider on...

611
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,341
      Get it off my face.
      Get it off my face.
      Get it off my face!

612
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,776
  You don't have
  a spider on your face.

613
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,611
  There you go. Got it.

614
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,880
You okay? You okay?

615
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,715
                          Yeah.
        Can you make it?

616
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:26,850
Fuck you, dude!

617
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,251
              All right.

618
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,392
Oh, what the...

619
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,395
                Shit!

620
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:39,262
You all right?

621
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,200
  There's all
  sorts of stuff here.

622
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,234
Whoa.

623
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,771
  What? Oh, nice.

624
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,206
Why?

625
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,640
Why?

626
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,975
  Yes!

627
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,610
Got to do
  something with that.

628
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,217
          So, I, uh...
        So, I found this gurney.

629
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,652
        I don't know who put it
        here, but it's here.

630
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,421
       I'm gonna lay down on it.

631
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,390
          Maybe feel some
          spirits go through me.

632
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,359
    Maybe just listen for them.

633
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,427
            They're coming.

634
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,998
            Oh, yeah!

635
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,270
Just listen.

636
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,822
              Whoa! Oh, shit!

637
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,410
    Hey, what do you want to do?
    You want to move on?

638
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,512
Shh! I heard something.

639
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,714
  What?

640
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:05,982
      Footsteps right over here.

641
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,046
    I'm gonna call Bridge, okay?

642
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,823
           <i> Samantha to Bridget.</i>

643
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:51,428
      <i> Hey, can you roll</i>
      <i> back the kitchen feed</i>
      <i> about a minute or so,</i>

644
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,662
      <i> and tell us if you</i>
      <i> see or hear anything?</i>

645
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,898
                You got it.

646
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,899
<i> Copy, thanks.</i>

647
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,711
            <i> Hey, what do you</i>
            <i> want to do?</i>

648
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:08,778
           <i> You want to move on?</i>

649
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,547
        <i> Shh! I heard something.</i>

650
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,649
                      <i> What?</i>

651
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,551
    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

652
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,703
            <i> Hey, what do you</i>
            <i> want to do?</i>

653
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,771
           <i> You want to move on?</i>

654
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,740
        <i> Shh! I heard something.</i>

655
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,842
                      <i> What?</i>

656
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,844
    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

657
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,954
                    <i> What?</i>

658
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,522
    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

659
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,561
          <i> Hey,</i>
        <i> what do you want to do?</i>
          <i> You want to move on?</i>

660
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,029
                <i> Shh! I heard...</i>

661
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,668
           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                           <i> Shh!</i>

662
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,670
           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                        <i> Shh!</i>

663
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,906
           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                        <i> Shh!</i>

664
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,143
Hey, guys.
       So I reviewed the footage
        a couple of times,

665
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:16,646
      and, Tyler, when you
      approached the piping
      in the center of the room,

666
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,016
          there's definitely
          something interesting
          in front of you.

667
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:23,787
      I can't say for sure
      what it is until I analyze
      the footage more, but...

668
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,121
        <i> I think we might have</i>
        <i> a possible orb.</i>

669
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,659
        A possible orb?
        I knew it.

670
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,762
    I knew we had
    something right over here.

671
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,963
        We just heard it.

672
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,435
    If you're still with us,
    please let us know!

673
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,705
    Give us some kind of sign,
    some kind of signal.

674
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,611
  Anything, any kind of noise.
  Don't be afraid.

675
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,882
    This is a digital recorder.

676
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,884
              We use it because
              the microphone can
              pick up things

677
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,119
              that the human ear
              can't hear.

678
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,657
                        Hello?

679
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,196
    If there's someone in here,
    you can say something
    into the little red light.

680
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,900
    If you have anything to say,
      we'll be able to hear you.

681
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,756
           That thing just fell.

682
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,725
              I was just
            laying on the gurney
              for 30 minutes,

683
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:36,960
               nothing going on.

684
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,661
              Gurney just fell
              out of nowhere.

685
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,232
    No explanation,
    just fell, just lost all...

686
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:43,666
               Something doesn't
                want us here.

687
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,934
            Something's saying,
            "Get out".

688
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,836
            Something's saying,
            "Not in my house.

689
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,271
              "You're not laying
              in my room."

690
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,707
    There's paranormal activity
    going on right here,

691
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,041
        something's paranormal.

692
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,812
            We have to go,
            we have to move on,

693
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,013
               we're going up to
                the freezer room
                right now.

694
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,928
                Hello?

695
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,932
                  Mark?

696
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,941
            Sam and Tyler,
            Mark and Cole,

697
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,809
      can I get a quick location
      check from you guys?

698
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:06,082
      <i> Hey, Bridge,</i>
      <i> Tyler and I are just</i>
      <i> outside the medical wing.</i>

699
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,851
<i> Yeah, me and Cole are on</i>
<i> our way into the freezer room.</i>

700
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,861
                Hello?

701
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,099
        Is someone there?

702
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,072
  We're filming in here
  so it's...

703
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,731
- <i> Bridget.</i>

704
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,232
            <i> Is everything okay?</i>

705
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,403
          Yes, I'm fine.
          You scared the shit
          out of me.

706
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,025
  All right, set that.
  You good?

707
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,126
  Yeah, that'll work.
      All right.

708
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,962
        But this...

709
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,870
      People that perished from
      the tuberculosis were
      brought down to this room.

710
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,673
        They were strung up by
        their necks and sliced,

711
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,274
          from their sternums
          down to their groins,

712
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,143
            releasing all
            bodily fluids.

713
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:43,713
      They didn't know how
      to control the disease.

714
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:45,281
        You want to get
        some promo stills?
        I got my camera here.

715
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,883
                  Yeah.
              All right.

716
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,885
              Good idea.

717
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,358
  All right, hold on.

718
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,095
  There you are.

719
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,432
  Give me more face.
              All right.

720
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,170
  Dude, dude, dude!

721
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,337
What? What?

722
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,106
              Cole! Dude!

723
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,442
Are you all right, man?

724
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:14,377
              Cole!

725
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,979
          Dude, come on, man.
          I can't see shit.

726
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,016
Cole.

727
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,418
          Dude,
        what are you doing, man?

728
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,921
  All right, good stuff, dude.
  Can't see.

729
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,323
                Christ!

730
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,859
              God...

731
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:32,995
  Dude, the camera's
  on the ground?
  Good job, asshole!

732
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,765
  Goddamn it!

733
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,967
  All right.
  Funny, dude.
  Great job.

734
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,737
  Cole!

735
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,042
  Dude, come on, man.
  I don't have time
  for this shit.

736
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,277
  Seriously, man.

737
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,180
  What the fuck?

738
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,149
  Dude, what are you doing?

739
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,785
  You want to break
  the fucking camera?

740
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,186
Careful.

741
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,154
  Cole!

742
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,290
  Dude, what are you doing?

743
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,262
  What... Dude!

744
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:08,931
  Dude.

745
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,235
  What the fuck, man?

746
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:16,205
  What do you mean, what?
  You're such an asshole.

747
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,540
              What is...
              Did we get it?

748
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,809
Did we...
  Kiss my ass, man!

749
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:21,811
  You wanna break the camera?
  You wanna break our things?

750
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,880
  Don't be an asshole, man.

751
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,318
This is Tyler and Sam.

752
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,387
        We're in the medical
        wing in the building.

753
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:52,508
              People who entered
              this room were
              extremely brave.

754
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,811
      This is where the most
    drastic measures were taken.

755
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,345
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

756
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,915
I heard something.

757
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:02,952
                Shh.

758
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,483
        Tyler to Mark, come in.

759
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,156
                Tyler to Mark.

760
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,961
        <i> Yes. What's up, Tyler?</i>

761
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,029
        Hey, man,
        how's the medical wing?

762
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:53,970
<i> I don't care if</i>
          <i> you don't believe me,</i>
          <i> all right?</i>

763
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,206
My heart's
        pounding right now.

764
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,276
      Is it music?

765
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,046
      Yeah, that's what I think.

766
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:44,987
             Let's try this way.

767
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,671
              So weird,
              it was right here.

768
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:03,472
            It was coming
            from right here.

769
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,946
          I think it's coming
          from upstairs now.

770
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,491
        It's crazy, right?
        Like it keeps changing.

771
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:23,726
  Whoa!

772
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26,295
    What? What? What?

773
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,231
        The curtain just moved.

774
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,635
  What do you mean
  the curtain just moved?

775
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,538
        I mean,
        the curtain moved, Sam.

776
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,615
            It's just the wind.

777
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,683
No, no, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, no, wait.

778
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,485
  Why?

779
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:23,753
                I don't know.
                I feel weird.
                I'm nervous.

780
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,689
          Don't be nervous.

781
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,757
            Come on.

782
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,447
Where'd it go?

783
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,224
- Fuck! It's a radio.
- What?

784
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,292
Fucking Mark
  hid the radio.

785
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,895
  Calm down. Calm down.
  You don't know if it was Mark.

786
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:14,730
      This is the exact
      kind of shit he pulls.

787
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:19,468
        I'm done dealing
        with this guy.

788
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,769
  Oh, come on.
              What?

789
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,638
How many times
  have you said that?

790
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,573
            I mean, I work so
            hard for this show.

791
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:27,209
            He does nothing
            except fuck around.
            Look at this.

792
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,712
Let me see it.

793
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,650
Hey, babe,
  how did Mark
  make a radio work

794
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,719
  with no batteries

795
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,320
  and not plugged in?
                        Well.

796
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,289
  He could have
  rigged something up.

797
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:43,325
      There's a million places
      where he could have...

798
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,328
Don't get
  overexcited, okay? Just...

799
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,297
  I'm not overexcited!
          Yes, you are!

800
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,865
          Just... I just wish
          that you'd calm down.

801
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,300
        Come on!

802
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,235
        I know. I know you
        care about the show.

803
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:54,737
  I know you're only looking
  out for the show.

804
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,372
  Nobody knows that
  more than me, baby.

805
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,410
  I'm sick of dealing
  with this guy.

806
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:02,778
      Wait, what time is it?

807
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:08,417
Ten, nine,
          eight, seven, six,

808
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,654
    five, four, three, two, one!

809
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,589
        Happy New Year!

810
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:14,757
                      Whoo!

811
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,961
          Hey! Happy New Year!
    Happy New Year!

812
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:21,897
  100 shows! 100 shows!

813
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,299
Where are you, Bridge?

814
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:25,601
  Happy New Year!

815
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:28,304
               Now it's my turn!
                Happy New Year!

816
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,471
                Oh, I love you.

817
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,207
  Happy New Year!

818
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,943
    Reality. This year, this
    clothing that you can wear,

819
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:37,479
        just looks like a black
        shirt on regular light.

820
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:40,249
        When infrared light
        hits it, it's a totally
        different ballgame.

821
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:43,319
    There's patterns and, like,
    a maze of mystery on it.

822
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,987
          And, I don't know.
        I think that could sell.

823
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,422
        I think it'd sell a lot.

824
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,723
        Make coats, make pants.

825
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:48,991
          Surprise!

826
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,693
              Aw, yeah.

827
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,795
GhostTrackers,
        we're all playing with,
        like...

828
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:55,464
  Um... Hey, guys.
  I'm sorry, I don't mean to
  interrupt. I just...

829
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,333
    Yeah, we have some big news.

830
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,867
- I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant!
- What?

831
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:02,371
    Oh, my God!
    Oh, my God!

832
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:03,672
    I knew it!
    I totally knew it!

833
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,873
                Did you know?

834
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:08,010
  Oh, no, that
  I wasn't pregnant.

835
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,546
                We've been...
  I'm in shock still. I...

836
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,648
  I know, I just told him,
  like, literally a second ago,

837
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,717
    and I don't know if
    you guys knew this...

838
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,486
        for a really long time.
            Uncle Mark says hi.

839
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,388
Wow, that's so...

840
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,791
  I didn't think this episode
  would get any better,
  but it just did.

841
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,327
That's really great,
  you guys.

842
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,730
You're all fucking uptight,
  you're having a kid,

843
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,832
it's New Years, just relax!
Yeah,
      I know those things.

844
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,667
Yeah, okay, well...

845
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,936
And I also know
  you put a fucking radio
  in the bathroom.

846
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:37,473
  I didn't put a fucking...
  Why would I put a fucking
  radio in the bathroom?

847
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:40,542
  Why would I put a radio
  in the bathroom?

848
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:42,478
And for our 100th episode,
      we got something new.

849
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,912
    Sam, tell us what we got.

850
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,581
      Oh! Well, actually,
      Bridget's the expert.

851
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,416
      I just call it
      the Sam-Cam.

852
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,551
            It's the Sam-Cam,
            but really
           it's just a body cam.

853
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:52,655
       Um, and it records audio,
        it's got a flash drive.

854
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,623
      And it's just a tiny thing
      so she can be handsfree

855
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,058
              while she does
              the investigation.

856
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,060
  Yes, so from now on
  in the sanatorium,

857
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,062
    whatever I see,
    you will see.

858
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,094
          We're here inside
          Richard Howl's room,

859
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:34,496
          and we set up
          some motion detectors.

860
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:41,704
    That'll give us an
    audio alarm if anything
    breaks that barrier

861
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,440
        and comes in
        around that doorway.

862
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:47,776
      I also set up this chair,

863
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,579
    right underneath where
    Richard Howl killed himself.

864
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,850
              I'm gonna sit here

865
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,720
      and hopefully gather
      some evidence for
      our investigation.

866
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,758
      Richard, are you here?

867
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,627
    I know you suffered a lot
    while you lived here.

868
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:07,463
  You had a hard life.

869
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:10,833
  But what you did
  to those kids,
  that was unacceptable.

870
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:12,101
  What are you doing?

871
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,739
      Just trying to
      provoke him a little bit.

872
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,006
  All right, Mark.

873
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,644
If you're here,
          just give us a sign.

874
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,646
            We just want to know
           if you're still here.

875
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,917
  If you're here,
  touch my arm, Richard.

876
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,923
        Come on.

877
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,493
  I'm gonna wait here
  all night.

878
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,563
  I know this is where
  you killed yourself.

879
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,939
          I don't care
          how long it takes.

880
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,113
      All right,
      now can we
      try it my way?

881
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,649
    Sitting quietly in the dark.

882
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:05,988
                  I'm so done
                 with this, man.

883
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,691
        What is up Tyler's ass?

884
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:10,993
               It's just like...

885
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:14,930
        Just trying to make this
         show better. That's it.

886
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,166
I know, man.

887
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:18,934
            He doesn't get that.
  It's his thing, man.

888
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,875
Wait, do you feel that?

889
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,579
                          What?

890
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:32,181
  It's right here.

891
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:33,849
Dude, what are you?
        Getting possessed again?

892
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,050
            What are you doing?

893
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,819
            Don't steal my
           goose bump line, man.

894
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,854
  I'm not stealing your
  fucking goose bump line.

895
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,691
            It's a heat.

896
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,194
           Dude, you're freaking
            me out, man.
    There's a heat. Shut up.

897
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,136
It is warm over here.

898
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,038
              It's warm.
              What is that?

899
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,878
What is that?

900
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,146
          It's here.
      Yeah.

901
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,547
            It's here.

902
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,250
        Whoa. It's hot.

903
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:09,885
          Yeah.

904
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,253
    You feel okay?

905
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:12,654
        You feel okay?

906
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,755
            Yeah.

907
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,724
      I don't feel good.
          What?

908
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,926
      I don't feel good, man.

909
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,761
Dude. You gonna throw up?

910
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:20,896
            No, it's...

911
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:22,631
    Dude, you're
    freaking me out.

912
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:23,899
    I know. Oh, God, it's...

913
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,767
        Dude!
        Oh, God. No, no, no.

914
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,736
        Bro, chill.
    Dude, give me a second.

915
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,006
      Dude, you're
      freaking me out.

916
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,008
        It's too hot.
    What is that?

917
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,114
    What the fuck?

918
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,987
      Dude, that sounded
      like a little girl, man.

919
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,731
Are you the little girl
  that was hurt in this room?

920
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,136
  We're your friends.
  We won't hurt you or anything.
  We just...

921
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,838
      Why don't you
      show yourself?

922
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:11,980
  Dude, what the...

923
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,049
  What's that?
          What was that?

924
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,553
    What was that?
    What was that?

925
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:20,656
  Guys, get down to
  the children's ward now!
  Now!

926
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:21,990
      We got real
      fucking activity.

927
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:24,159
    Real activity.
    Class A EVPs.

928
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,827
              Right now.
              Get down here.

929
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,730
              Dude, oh my God.

930
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,332
      Dude, that was real.
            That was...

931
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,601
  That's the first time in
  nine years, that's a real...

932
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:34,269
            You want to go
            check it out?
            Go for it.

933
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,072
  I mean, of course,
  I want to check it out.
  You don't want to go?

934
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,807
              Something could
              happen here.

935
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,342
          I feel like
          I should stick around.

936
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,777
              All right.

937
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,945
          I've waited here
          long enough.

938
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:44,279
            Are you sure?
            Nervous, yes?

939
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,882
          I think something
          could happen here too.

940
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,050
  Okay. Well,
  good luck with that.

941
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:50,118
  I'm going,
  if you're sure.

942
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,286
                  Yeah.

943
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:52,654
  Okay. I love you.

944
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:53,789
                 I love you too.

945
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:54,923
        Bye.

946
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,964
Oh, fuck.

947
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,968
  Ty, my battery just died.

948
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,870
Oh, shit! Fuck.

949
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:10,906
              You okay?
              Yeah, yeah.

950
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:14,109
      I got a dead brick.
      Do you have a flashlight?

951
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,744
                  Yes.

952
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,682
Thank you.

953
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,951
            Okay.

954
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,120
              Hello?

955
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,923
              Hello?

956
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,697
        Is somebody here?

957
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,405
                Ow!

958
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:18,373
            Ow! Oh! Ow!

959
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,808
               Fuck, fuck, fuck!

960
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,009
                        Ah!

961
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,178
    Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

962
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:25,881
                      Oh, no.

963
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,418
            Oh, please, no.

964
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,719
            Oh!

965
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,891
Oh, shit, Samantha,
        fucking klutz.

966
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,294
                  Shit.

967
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:46,201
Goddamn it.

968
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:49,071
  Yeah, don't step on this.
  There's some advice.

969
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,373
<i> Guys,</i>  <i> I'm freaking out right now.
</i>  <i> Where are you?</i>

970
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,275
  <i> There is little kids up here.</i>
  <i> This little ghost ki...</i>

971
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,044
<i> No thank you, please.</i>

972
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,315
            Again, do it again.

973
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:01,850
<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

974
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,485
Whoa.

975
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,153
            It's a little girl.
  That's a little girl.

976
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,055
    It's clearly a little girl.
  That is a little girl.

977
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,057
  You heard it with your ears.
  You heard this
  with your ears?

978
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,726
  We heard this with our ears,
  believe me.

979
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:12,461
                  Give it to me.

980
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:14,463
<i> No, thank you, please.</i>
 God.

981
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,431
          "No, thank you..."
        "No, thank you, please."

982
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:19,301
            That's an EVP,
            a disembodied voice
            in this room.

983
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,036
  Yup.
        In the children's wing.

984
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:25,040
<i> No, thank you, please.</i>
 <i> No, thank you, please.</i>

985
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:27,776
        <i> No, thank you, please.</i>

986
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:30,112
          Did you listen to this
          all the way through?

987
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,447
    I think so.
          Come here, come here.
          Tell me what you hear.

988
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:34,883
<i>-  No, thank you, please.</i>

989
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:38,120
              There.
              Did you hear that?
      Play it again.

990
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:40,288
<i>-  No, thank you, please.</i>

991
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,924
"Go away."

992
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:43,992
<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

993
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,527
<i> Go away.</i>

994
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,797
           You hear that, right?
                Yeah.

995
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,532
          That's two...
          Two disembodied
          voices recorded.

996
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,234
      Jesus Christ.

997
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,336
                <i> GhostTrackers,</i>
                 100 episodes...
    I didn't hear that.

998
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:57,005
           Hillcrest Sanatorium.
            We have evidence
            of the paranormal.

999
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,140
          Tyler is going to
          shit in his pants.

1000
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,374
  You didn't hear that,
  right, Cole?

1001
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,109
No.

1002
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,911
   Cole, listen, listen, listen.
  Did you hear, like, "Go away?"

1003
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,179
       You didn't hear that part
        with your ears?
  No, I didn't.

1004
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:06,181
        This is amazing.
        This is amazing.

1005
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,049
      One more time.
      Listen again.

1006
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:09,551
<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

1007
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:10,519
<i> Go away.</i>
 "Go away."

1008
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,848
Sometimes we
  like to use trigger objects
  to try to coax

1009
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,183
  any spirits in the room
  to interact with us.

1010
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,320
  In this case, Mark and Cole
  successfully recorded

1011
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,589
  the disembodied voice
  of a little girl,

1012
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:23,525
  so we're using candy canes
  as a trigger object.

1013
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,061
  We've also lowered ourselves
  down to her level

1014
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,530
  to make her feel
  more comfortable.

1015
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,631
  You're recording?
                        Mmm-hmm.

1016
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:30,966
Okay.

1017
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,936
Hello?

1018
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:37,005
Is there anybody here?

1019
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,176
  Is there a little girl
  here with us?

1020
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,581
  I know you're here,
  we heard you.

1021
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,884
  We'd love to
  hear you again.

1022
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:53,154
  We brought you some candy.

1023
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,492
  Do you see this candy?
  You can have all
  the candy you want.

1024
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,095
          You can touch it,
          you can take it.

1025
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,304
  My name is Samantha.
  What's your name?

1026
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,407
  Can you tell me
  your name?

1027
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,382
Be quiet.

1028
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:22,684
I told you.
                    I told you!

1029
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,554
I told...
            I fucking told you.

1030
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,057
Did you hear that?
  Did you hear that?

1031
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,564
       Richard, are you in here?

1032
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,467
          I'm here on the
        anniversary of the night
          you killed those kids.

1033
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,205
       You want to do something?
        Do something to me.

1034
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:48,677
               Come on, Richard.

1035
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,059
                        Hello?

1036
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,167
  Samantha to Tyler.
  Tyler, come in.

1037
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,506
  Tyler, come in! Come on,
  you got to get up here.
  You're missing everything.

1038
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,711
  <i> Tyler, what are you doing?</i>
  <i> Come on.</i>

1039
01:06:56,713 --> 01:07:00,248
  <i> Samantha to Tyler.</i>
  <i> Tyler, go. Tyler.</i>

1040
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,019
  Sam, the Howl feed just
  went dead for some reason.

1041
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:08,256
    It's working now.
    Tyler isn't in the room.

1042
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,725
<i> I think you guys</i>
      <i> should go check on him</i>
      <i> and make sure he's okay.</i>

1043
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,060
                Okay.

1044
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,495
    Okay, copy, yeah.
    I'm going back.

1045
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:14,729
    I'm going back.

1046
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,301
          Tyler!

1047
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:22,771
Ty!

1048
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:26,107
Tyler!
              This stupid thing.

1049
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:28,376
          All right,
          I left him right here.

1050
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,178
Come on.

1051
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,513
Tyler, baby,
          where'd you go?

1052
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,115
- Tyler?
- What the fuck?

1053
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,518
Come on, Tyler!

1054
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:58,640
      if you see Tyler
      anywhere in the building?

1055
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:00,308
            He's not in
            Richard Howl's room.

1056
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,344
          None of them?
          Check again.

1057
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:04,679
          Whoa!

1058
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,581
- What the fuck?

1059
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,819
Guys, check this out.

1060
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,111
  What the fuck was that?

1061
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,846
Wow.
  What the fuck was that?

1062
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:40,615
        The fucking chair just
        flies across the room?

1063
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,322
<i> The chair</i>
  <i> just moved.</i>

1064
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:50,191
  <i> I was here a second ago,</i>
  <i> and it just moved.</i>

1065
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,230
  <i> And the...</i>
  <i> The alarm went off.</i>

1066
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:58,299
Come on,
  he set this shit up.
What is he doing?

1067
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,202
Dude, if he's fucking

1068
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,871

1069
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,878
  <i> There's nobody here.</i>

1070
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,219
  <i> This room is hot.</i>

1071
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:20,455
  <i> And the temperature's</i>

Come on!

1081
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,672
Tyler!
        Call the police.

1082
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:13,374
Call the what?
  I said, "Call the police."

1083
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,376
  How am I supposed to call?
  There's no fucking
  service here!

1084
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,811
  How am I supposed
  to call the police?

1085
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,314
              We'll go get...
              No, go get them.
              Go get the police.

1086
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:21,683
  Come on! Is he fucking
  with me? Sam, is he fucking
  with me right now?

1087
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,651
        Is he fucking with you?
  Yeah, is he fucking
  with me right now?

1088
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,653
            Did you see what was
              on that video cam?

1089
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,722
  Is he trying to get back
  at me for all the bullshit?
  It's such bullshit!

1090
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,657
                Would you just
               shut up for once?
  What do you want?

1091
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,392
  What are you talking about?
                  I don't know
                what I just saw.

1092
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,761
Mark,
      shut the fuck up, man.

1093

01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:32,987
What's going on?

1190
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,929
- Wh...

1192
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,140
Come on, come on,

What the fuck?

1193
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,714
- Help!

1194
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,119

1195
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,289
    Cole. Cole,
    stay where you are, man.
    We're coming for you, dude.

1196
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,057
Let me see. Fuck.

01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:11,659
Help me!

1198
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,260
It's coming
       from here. It's this way.

1199
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:17,932
Help!

1200
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,636
Cole!
            Help!

1201
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,037
Oh, my God!

1202
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,007
            Mark, what the fuck
            is that?

1203
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,275
- Cole!
- Mark?

1204
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,877
- Help!
- Cole!

1205
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:32,113
- Cole! Cole!
- Cole!

1206
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:33,748
                  What the fuck?

1207
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,282
                           Cole!
                           Cole!

1208
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:36,417
Cole!

1209
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:37,852
Cole!

1210
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,423
  What the fuck? Cole!
      This room is empty.

1211
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:45,026
  Bro, where are you?

1212
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:49,730
Shut the fuck...
  It was coming from in here.

1213
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,402
      Where the fuck is Bridget?

1214
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:57,071
  Where the fuck is Bridget?
        She was right behind me.

1215
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:59,140
    She was right behind me.
    Where's...
  What the fuck?

1216
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:01,442
Jesus fuck!
  Bridget!

1217
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,811
          Bridget! Bridget!
                      Bridget!

1218
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,347
      Bridget!
          Bridget!

1219
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,049
Where the fuck is she?

1220
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:10,985
Oh, Jesus Christ.
  Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, shit! Shit!

1221
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:12,853
Bridget!
          Are you in there?
    Watch out, watch out!

1222
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:15,189
            Bridget! Bridget!
            Open the door, Mark.

1223
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,857
Open the fucking door!
  I'm trying!

1224
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,125
Bridget!

1225
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,716
Bridget!

1226
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,984
           That's it, that's it!
            We gotta go!
           We gotta go now! Run!

1227
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,352
          Just run! Run!
    No, we can't leave...

1228
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:47,755
            Just run! Go!

1229
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:48,956
                    Bridget!
          Run!

1230
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,224
                      Bridget!

1231
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:58,365
Come.
            Don't!

1232
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,035
I'm scared.

1233
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,269
No! Mark...
Shit.
  Oh, shit. Fuck.

1234
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,938
      Go, go, go.
              Mark...

1235
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,840
        We can't leave...
        Go. Oh, shit!

1236
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,475
Fuck!

1237
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,746
Go! Go!

1238
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,447
  We're gonna go
  to the police
  and we're gonna go back.

1239
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:15,049
    I don't give a shit! Go!

1240
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:18,352
      Don't fucking tell me!
      Just go!

1241
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,821
  That's my husband,
  and I can't just leave him!
      What are you doing?

1242
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:23,524
      I don't know!
                  Go!

1243
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:26,994
  I don't know what to do!
      I don't give a shit! Go!

1244
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:29,764
  I'm trying. Oh, my God.
    Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

1245
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:31,465
Wait, Tyler!
              Tyler!

1246
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:34,068
    That's my husband.
    That's my husband! Tyler!
        Sam, no! No, Sam!

1247
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,770
                    Sam, don't!
              Babe!

1248
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,905
                        Sam!
        Please don't go back in!

1249
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,440
                    Sam!

1250
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:42,076
- Tyler!
- Sam!

1251
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:50,885
No! No!

1252
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,119
            No...

1253
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,956
          Tyler! Tyler!

1254
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:01,862
        Mark? No, no.

1255
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:04,431
          No. Please, no!
          No, no! No, Mark!

1256
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:07,034
No!  No!

1257
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,871
            No!

1258
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,185
    I know you're here.

1259
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
      What do you want?

1260
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,435
What do you want?

1261
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:47,541
            Tyler!

1262
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,347
            Tyler, we have
            to get out of here.

1263
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,226
                      Oh, God!

1264
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,995
            Oh, God! Oh, my God!
            Oh, my God!

1265
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,170
              Tyler!

1266
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:21,308
      Tyler, where are you?

1267
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:40,561
  Help me! Help me!

1268
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,496
  Please, someone help me!

1269
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:45,933
  Someone!
  Someone please help me!
  Please!

1270
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:49,270
  God damn it!
  Somebody please!

1271
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,527
Shut up!

1272
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,963
    Oh, my God! Help! Help!

1273
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,481
  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1274
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,435
          No! No! No!

1275
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,575
        No, no! Please!

1276
01:26:09,265 --> 01:26:11,665
  So Cole and I are walking
  around the perimeter,

1277
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,267
  just scouting things out,

1278
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:16,370
  and then we discover
  our boy Irwin over here.

1279
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:17,771
  I thought he was
  taking a piss.

1280
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,474
  He's just
  talking to no one.

1281
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:21,909
            Absolutely no one.

1282
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:27,581
            Or, maybe he's
            talking to a demon.

1283
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:35,389
    Dude, seriously,
    this guy's out of his mind.

1284
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:37,224
                He's crazy, man.
                What's he doing?

1285
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,728
What's he doing?
            No, no, no, no, no.
