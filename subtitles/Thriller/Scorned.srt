1
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,939
<i>Does love die</i>

2
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,319
<i>When we are gone?</i>

3
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,281
<i>Or will two hearts</i>

4
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:19,952
<i>Be there forever?</i>

5
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:24,916
<i>Can stolen love live</i>

6
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,920
<i>To be returned?</i>

7
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,424
<i>Does love die then</i>

8
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:38,425
<i>Or do we want to know?</i>

9
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:48,435
<i>Does love die?</i>

10
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:58,111
<i>Does love die?</i>

11
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:22,893
Morning, Kevin.

12
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:29,230
Who do you love?

13
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,190
What are you doing?

14
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,193
I'm loving you the
way you love me.

15
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:39,194
What do you mean?

16
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:47,915
Gave you a little bit
of meds while...

17
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,375
Ow. Ow.

18
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,584
you were sleeping.

19
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,712
That'll keep you
calm and cooperative

20
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,255
and a little loopy.

21
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,423
Don't worry about that.

22
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,716
What, is this the 4th one?

23
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,593
You know, I didn't want to put
your cell phone in the dryer.

24
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:01,387
You text a lot,
but you really should use

25
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:02,888
your delete key a
little more often.

26
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,227
All right, give me that.
What are you...

27
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,395
You want to tell me something?
What's that?

28
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,480
What are you... okay.

29
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,609
That's...

30
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,195
okay, this is cute.

31
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,574
Um...

32
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:22,908
that's my phone.

33
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,076
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

34
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,536
You...

35
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,039
are a cheater.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,624
I got you.

37
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,126
What's this say?

38
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:35,755
"I'm going to tell Sadie
it's over this weekend."

39
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,965
When were you going
to tell me, honey?

40
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,550
When were you going
to tell me it's over?

41
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,385
After we were making
love a million times?

42
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,803
After I sucked your dick?

43
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,472
- Whoa, shush, shush. All right.
- What part of this weekend...

44
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,932
what part of this weekend
were you going to tell me?

45
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,268
Um...

46
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,771
I know, okay?

47
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,814
I made some texts,

48
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:55,775
and they're fucking stupid texts.

49
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,027
Yeah, they're stupid.
Here's one stupid text for you now.

50
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,445
That's a dumb thing to fucking do.

51
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,072
I'm going to read this
to you real quick.

52
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,616
Last Friday, you text,

53
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:06,327
- "I miss your magic pussy."
- You got to...

54
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,121
What's magic about it, honey?

55
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,456
Does she pull rabbits out of it?

56
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:16,462
What the fuck happened to my head?

57
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:20,800
You scorned me, Kevin.

58
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,843
Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry.

59
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:25,054
- You took my heart...
- I'm really sorry.

60
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,806
and you...

61
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,933
- you broke my heart.
- I'm sorry.

62
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,644
And you did it with my
best friend Jennifer!

63
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,438
I'm sorry, baby.

64
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,315
<i>You're the girl</i>

65
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,150
<i>I've been dreaming of</i>

66
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:40,319
<i>- You're the girl...</i>
- That one's on me, rainbow.

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Thank you, handsome.

68
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:48,285
That's, like, the second drink
he's given you on the house.

69
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,662
Well, when you got it, you got it.

70
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,624
Let the bartender know I'm the
one without the boyfriend.

71
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,835
Yes, well,
I'll be without a boyfriend

72
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,336
after this weekend.

73
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:01,048
He'll be my fiance.

74
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,009
Really?

75
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,555
I... I just don't see Kevin
as the marrying type.

76
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,676
Yeah, well, clearly you've
never slept with me, honey.

77
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:15,855
No, but really,
I have this gut feeling

78
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,023
that Kevin picked this weekend

79
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:22,570
and planned it all out
to propose to me.

80
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,738
Sadie, I...

81
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,534
You guys have been
together for, what,

82
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,536
less than 6 months?

83
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,246
You really think you
know him that well?

84
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:36,876
Oh, I knew I wanted to marry
Kevin after our first date.

85
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,129
He's the one.

86
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,007
When you meet the
love of your life,

87
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,802
you'll just know.

88
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:50,890
I guess.

89
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,018
Listen, Sadie, I really like Kevin.

90
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,561
I do,

91
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,647
but you guys fight an awful lot.

92
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,649
I think...

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,736
your mommy is jealous.

94
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,363
I think you have a
massive crush on me,

95
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,865
you want me to marry you,

96
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,242
but unfortunately
neither of us are gay.

97
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,453
Oh.

98
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:17,249
Jen, you're my best friend.

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,376
I love you so much.

100
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,921
And if...

101
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:25,257
when I get married...

102
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:30,221
I want you to be my maid of honor.

103
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,765
<i>When you tell me about
the way I smile</i>

104
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,100
<i>The way I present my sexy style</i>

105
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,353
<i>You're the one that
gets me all confused</i>

106
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,939
<i>You're the one I love
and the one I choose</i>

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,106
<i>When you tell me about...</i>

108
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,942
Baby, I love that you're rich.

109
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,152
Aww.
I love that you're deep.

110
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,904
So you don't love me for my mind?

111
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,072
The crazy part, yeah.

112
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,200
Well, you're in luck,

113
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,411
'cause I feel like getting
crazy this weekend.

114
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,205
Well, don't get too
crazy there, Sadie.

115
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:58,040
I'll have to lock you
up in that prison.

116
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,043
Ugh.
I hate passing that place.

117
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,211
Always creeps me out.

118
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,630
I promise to visit
you every Sunday.

119
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,966
<i>Just for you and me</i>

120
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,968
<i>Just for you and me</i>

121
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,969
<i>Oh, my first love</i>

122
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,308
<i>Little did I know</i>

123
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,144
<i>That one can never know</i>

124
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:21,480
<i>Our love</i>

125
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,315
<i>Will always be...</i>

126
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:24,858
Baby, I love this place.

127
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,735
- We need to stay here till Christmas.
- Christmas?

128
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,530
Let's just try to make it
through the weekend.

129
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:34,034
- You're so funny.
<i>- My first love</i>

130
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:39,035
<i>My first love.</i>

131
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,879
Kevin, you know I love you,

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,673
not just for your money.

133
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,467
Mostly for your gorgeous hair.

134
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,555
Looks like a storm's rolling in.

135
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:57,516
That's going to be so romantic.

136
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,519
Oh, God.
You're going to get cancer.

137
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,646
I don't inhale.

138
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:06,525
Besides, they're not
as bad as cigarettes.

139
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,194
These never bothered you when
we first started going out.

140
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,821
You clearly haven't learned

141
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,573
that girls put up
with a lot of things

142
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,867
before they lock you in.

143
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,493
I'm your girlfriend now.

144
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:19,038
Things change, you know.

145
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,373
I choose to defy you.

146
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:24,251
Does that turn you on?

147
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,545
No.

148
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,380
But...

149
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:33,218
this does.

150
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,639
I have a feeling this is going
to be a whiskey weekend.

151
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,099
You know what I mean?

152
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,810
Capital idea.

153
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,311
Mm-hmm.

154
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,739
Now, I bet you...

155
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,740
want to fuck me right now.

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,750
Wait. You're right.

157
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:07,044
You're going to have
to catch me first.

158
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,970
Ow.

159
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,786
Come on, old man.

160
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:41,954
This is good for me,

161
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,372
'cause I want to do
the Ironman next year...

162
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,165
- Come on!
- ...and this kind of cardio

163
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,292
is exactly what I need.

164
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:52,293
Trying to kill me.

165
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:53,799
Whoo!

166
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,467
- All righty.
- I win.

167
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,136
I guess since you won,

168
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,554
you qualify for the victory swim.

169
00:09:58,555 --> 00:09:59,055
No!

170
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:28,997
Come and get it!

171
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:34,461
What's this?

172
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,262
Kevin, do you love me?

173
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,098
Of course I love you.

174
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,600
Even though I'm crazy?

175
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,187
I love you 'cause you're crazy.

176
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,996
I think we should get out.

177
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,623
No, no, I don't care.

178
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:08,874
I don't care.

179
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,542
If lightning strikes us right now,

180
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,711
it'd be God's way of keeping
us together for eternity.

181
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,756
Let's live a little longer,
shall we?

182
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,604
You know what you get, don't you?

183
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:32,147
What?

184
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,732
What?

185
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,942
What are you doing?

186
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,361
- You're the winner.
- Oh, my God.

187
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,865
On the behalf of the community,
we'd like to bestow this award upon you.

188
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,659
You just came 3 minutes ago.

189
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,744
Well, I'm not Superman.

190
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,663
Yes, well, I am your Kryptonite,

191
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,541
but I need to go dry our
messy, messy clothes.

192
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,708
- Okay?
- Okay,

193
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,920
- Leave me alone for 5 minutes.
- Yeah, all right. Fine.

194
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:57,840
We'll be right out here.

195
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,263
Kevin,

196
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:49,391
tell me how much you love me again.

197
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,727
Okay, I love you again.

198
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,687
I'm serious.

199
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:58,688
You know how much I love you.

200
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,988
Do you think we're going
to grow old together?

201
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:06,241
Sadie, you having a
girl moment right now?

202
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,993
Is that what that is?

203
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,536
Can you really be happy having sex

204
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,496
with just one woman for
the rest of your life?

205
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,999
As long as that one
woman was you, yeah.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,292
For the rest of your life?

207
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,794
Starting today, the only pussy
you'll ever have is mine?

208
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:22,795
As long as you're attached to it.

209
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,972
So...

210
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,849
you'll never cheat on me?

211
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,644
Honey, you're too cute, all right?
Now cut it out, would you?

212
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,479
Stop being so serious.

213
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,022
Come over here and kiss me already.

214
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,482
What's a fella got to do?

215
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,610
Where are my cigarettes, honey?

216
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,862
You give me so much grief
for smoking cigars,

217
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,449
and you smoke that shit?

218
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,826
You know how much I hate
that medication you take.

219
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,703
We've had this argument.

220
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:55,499
Yeah, I know, and for good reason.

221
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,210
Psychs are paid by
pharmaceutical companies

222
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,378
to prescribe that shit.

223
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,379
It's a total scam.

224
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,887
I think meds make
people more crazy.

225
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:10,472
Some people need it.

226
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,100
You've never been manic.
You don't understand.

227
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:15,477
If you want me to get off my meds,

228
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,854
get me pregnant.

229
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,024
I'd stop taking 'em
if I was pregnant.

230
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,360
I think we'd have to be
married first for that.

231
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:30,071
Is that a proposal?

232
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:35,618
I know what you want.

233
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,459
I'm going to give you
what you really want.

234
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,460
- All right.
- You're gonna love this, baby.

235
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,893
You guys like it

236
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,061
- when girls are angry...
- Ow.

237
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,855
and pissed off when they're
giving you head, huh?

238
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,481
- Really? Come on now.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,150
That's how you like it.

240
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,860
- You pervs like it like this.
- All right, that's...

241
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,154
Ah, God!

242
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:10,699
God! What the fuck?!
Ah, my eyes.

243
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,701
God damn...
get me some water.

244
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,956
No. No water.

245
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,387
What the fuck happened
to my fucking head?

246
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,849
You scorned me, Kevin.

247
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,268
Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry.

248
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,520
- You took my heart...
- I'm really sorry.

249
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,815
and you...
you broke my heart.

250
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:44,983
I'm sorry, baby.

251
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:46,735
And you know how much
that was going to hurt me.

252
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,862
Um...

253
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,864
I knew.
I'm stupid.

254
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm really sorry.
I was just...

255
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,784
You know what?
You know what?

256
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:56,953
I love you.

257
00:15:56,954 --> 00:16:00,707
I love you.

258
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,001
Do you know what I was going
to tell you this weekend?

259
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,169
What?

260
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,754
This weekend,
I was going to tell you

261
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,632
that we're going to have a baby.

262
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,301
I took a pregnancy test last week.

263
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:15,138
I am growing an innocent little
baby right here in my tummy.

264
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,932
And you know I could
never abort a baby.

265
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,183
I could never harm an innocent life.

266
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:19,768
- I'm going to be sick.
- You know that, right?

267
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,521
- That's why I...
- All right.

268
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:26,775
I stopped taking my lithium...
for you.

269
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,401
- For you and the baby.
- I didn't know you were pregnant.

270
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,029
That's right, 'cause you only cheat
on girls who aren't pregnant.

271
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,031
That's right.
You are such an ethical man.

272
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,200
I knew you had character, honey.

273
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,203
I knew you had character.

274
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,206
- Um...
- Go ahead, apologize.

275
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,374
Tell me you're sorry.

276
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,711
Tell me what a big fucking
mistake you made.

277
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:49,131
I'm sorry.
That was a big mistake.

278
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,717
Yes, it was.
But you know what?

279
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:54,386
- I can fix it.
- Yeah.

280
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:57,597
I sent Jennifer a text
message from your phone.

281
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,891
You told her we broke up

282
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,894
and I had a friend
come and pick me up

283
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:05,647
and you have the house for
the rest of the weekend.

284
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,858
And she was so excited about that.

285
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,527
Oh. Hold on.

286
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,487
Hold on.
You just got a message.

287
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,697
It's from Jennifer.

288
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,824
I'll read it to you word for word.

289
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,411
"I can leave tonight after work."

290
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,289
Then she wrote an X and an O

291
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,624
and an X and an O, etcetera.

292
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,252
Those are hugs and kisses.
I think she really likes you, honey.

293
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:31,047
I really do.

294
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,800
Oh. Another message from Jennifer.

295
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,052
- "I can't wait to see you, Kevin."
- Come on.

296
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,764
"PS, I'm going to B wearing
something extra naughty."

297
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:43,185
Whoo! My goodness.
You two are frisky.

298
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,103
You promised me a weekend.

299
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,063
We're just going to
have a friend join us.

300
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:50,734
Remember that time when you asked me
if I would be willing to do a threesome?

301
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,486
That's the thing about
threesomes, of course.

302
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,323
You got to do it all together.
You can't do it separately.

303
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,617
- Fuck!
- Ooh.

304
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,744
I got to learn how to tie
ropes a little better.

305
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,454
- You fucking...
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

306
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,331
Okay. You know what?
You know what?

307
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:05,540
Come here. Come here.

308
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,751
You're going to take this
whole damn bottle right now.

309
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,461
Right now.

310
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:11,671
Okay. Okay.

311
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,301
Fuck!

312
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,636
Oh, my fucking head.

313
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,596
- Oh, my fucking head.
- Yeah.

314
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:24,597
I'm about to bash your head in
again if you don't calm down.

315
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,605
Okay. Oh.

316
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,732
Okay.

317
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,525
It's okay.

318
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:36,321
It's okay.

319
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:40,533
I really think I should get
you a cigar or something.

320
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:44,454
He loves me.

321
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,957
He loves me.

322
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,502
He loves me not.

323
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:53,421
He loves me.

324
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:57,550
He loves me not.

325
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:00,262
He loves me.

326
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:05,263
He loves me not.
Honey, this is going to be so romantic.

327
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,395
Ooh.

328
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:09,896
Now, honey,
you shouldn't be drinking.

329
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,607
Just...

330
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,817
it's not good for you.

331
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,820
You shouldn't be drinking, smoking.

332
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,780
There's a baby in you now.

333
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,865
Baby, my mama drank and smoked

334
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:25,662
all through my pregnancy,
and I turned out all right.

335
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:26,830
Want some more Vicodin?

336
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,498
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

337
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,127
Here's one right here for later
and one right here for now.

338
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,713
Hey, no! Ow.

339
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,506
There we go.
That's better.

340
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:38,758
Please, you got to stop.

341
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,803
You need to stop asking me that.

342
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,555
Look at how supportive I'm being.

343
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:47,642
I set up the candles.
I got the flower petals here.

344
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,853
I swear to God, you men never
appreciate anything women do for you.

345
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,272
He loves me.

346
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,399
He loves me not.

347
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,568
He loves me.
He loves me not.

348
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,570
I certainly hope
I end on "He loves me"!

349
00:19:58,571 --> 00:19:59,071
Me too.

350
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,591
"Follow the rose petals."

351
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,092
Hmm.

352
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:26,093
"Follow the rose petals," Bootsie.

353
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:46,493
Go to sleep here, little Bootsie.

354
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:53,833
Mama's got a hot date.

355
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:57,962
Don't mind if I do.

356
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:09,678
"Take your clothes off."

357
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,318
"Come in on your hands and knees"?

358
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:22,362
Shit.

359
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:27,492
Baby?

360
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:35,996
Your naughty little puppy is here.

361
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,936
Hello, sexy.

362
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,397
Mmm.

363
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,566
Take the gag off.

364
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,194
Take the gag off.

365
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:06,195
No.

366
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,785
Take the gag off of me.

367
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:13,455
Kevin, you're such a freak.

368
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,376
Don't use the handcuffs.

369
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:19,836
You don't need to
use the handcuffs.

370
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,797
Bad dog.

371
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,304
You're a cheater, Jennifer,

372
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,889
just like Kevin.

373
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,892
Sadie, this is crazy.

374
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,643
Yeah, it is.

375
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,604
We were friends.

376
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,731
You were going to be my fricking
maid of honor, for Christ's sake.

377
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,232
I know.

378
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:45,320
I know, but we can talk
about this, right?

379
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:48,698
No.

380
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,617
I'm really sorry, Sadie.

381
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:54,204
I know how this must look.

382
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:59,205
Sadie, there's something
important you need to know.

383
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,173
I'm sure there is,

384
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:08,593
but I don't want to hear
anything from you right now.

385
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:11,638
Kevin likes his women clean.

386
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,682
Don't you, Kevin?

387
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:19,270
Oh, I prescribed him some medicine.
He probably passed out again.

388
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:24,271
Sadie, what are you doing?

389
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,487
Hey! Hey!

390
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,863
Hey! Hey!

391
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:31,282
Come here.

392
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:35,537
You know what they used to do
to cheaters in the medieval days?

393
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,789
For one, they used
to cut off their hair.

394
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,749
- No. No.
- You hold still,

395
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,251
or I'll pop your fucking eye out.

396
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:46,252
- Please don't.
- I have to.

397
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,394
Please stop.

398
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:06,276
Sadie.

399
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:10,154
I want to explain everything to you.

400
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:14,155
It should have been you
in that hospital, not me.

401
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:22,707
Please.

402
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:28,965
Jen, you look so beautiful.

403
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,966
Kevin, she's all ready for you.

404
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,017
Isn't she pretty, Kevin?

405
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,603
You got to let us go.
This is...

406
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,895
this is crazy.

407
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,231
As crazy as you two
loving behind my back?

408
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:49,694
I'm trying to make you feel better.

409
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:52,280
No more guilt, no hiding.

410
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,407
I'm going to watch.

411
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:57,702
That way, neither of you are doing
anything behind my back anymore.

412
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,704
It's all out in the open,

413
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,707
no lies, no deceit.

414
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,710
Don't you two feel cleaner now?

415
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,588
Sadie, we don't want to do this.

416
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,591
You don't have a say in this, Jen.

417
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,344
Did I have a say when you started

418
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:18,139
loving my boyfriend behind my back?

419
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,684
You are a...

420
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:22,852
skanky whore.

421
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:29,734
Look, look, are you okay?

422
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:33,321
I'm...

423
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:59,806
Jennifer...

424
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:03,768
you know I love Bootsie.

425
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,937
Oh, my God.

426
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,150
You two remember
that woman who tried

427
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:12,671
to dry off her poodle
in the microwave?

428
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,947
She should have read the instructions,
but women never do.

429
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,615
For Christ's sake, Sadie,
this is a little dog.

430
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:18,783
You can't do this.

431
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,243
I think 10 minutes should suffice.

432
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,869
Just cut the bullshit.

433
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,289
You two...

434
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,709
you two started the bullshit.

435
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,086
Now, what I want you to do

436
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,380
is oral her

437
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,257
right now,

438
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:37,009
or I will start this microwave,

439
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,681
and her little doggy will
cook from the inside out.

440
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:45,768
3...

441
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,979
2, 1.

442
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,355
Okay, okay. We'll do it.

443
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,400
Just don't hurt the puppy.

444
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,655
Eat her pussy.

445
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:58,990
Do it now.

446
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:03,991
It's okay, Kevin.
Just do it.

447
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,795
She taste as good as I do?

448
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:17,550
You better answer no.

449
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:22,551
Be nice to have some
music right about now.

450
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:25,308
<i>Step a little
bit closer, baby</i>

451
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:30,309
<i>Now, do you like
what you see?</i>

452
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:33,399
Better not be telling
her you love her.

453
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,069
You only love me, remember?

454
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,530
<i>Look a little
bit wiser, baby</i>

455
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:44,035
<i>I see nervousness
in your eyes</i>

456
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,704
<i>if you want to
approach me, baby</i>

457
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:51,209
<i>You need to learn
to be smooth and sly</i>

458
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,462
<i>Tell me what you
really want from me</i>

459
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:58,257
<i>I've heard that
pickup line before</i>

460
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:00,968
<i>If you think you've won
my goods, baby</i>

461
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:05,969
<i>Then I'll lead you
to the fucking door.</i>

462
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:13,310
Sex always makes me hungry.

463
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:16,108
Don't pass out on me, Kevin.

464
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:19,487
Oh, God, now I have to go easier
on those drugs I'm giving you.

465
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,824
I just love eating outside.
I'm so glad it stopped raining.

466
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:25,827
Watery tacos get all
mushy and nasty.

467
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:27,328
Here you go, honey.

468
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,329
Why don't you have some?
Eat it!

469
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:37,380
Well, neither of you told
me how good my food is.

470
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,758
I'm practically an expert
at making tacos.

471
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,302
- How many times I made you tacos?
- A lot.

472
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:45,054
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

473
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,682
I'm pretty sure these are my best.

474
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,351
You like 'em, Jennifer?

475
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:54,105
Mm-hmm.

476
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,857
Well, speak up, honey.
I can't hear you.

477
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,608
I said yes.

478
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,944
These tacos are good.
Okay, Sadie?

479
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,112
You goddamn psycho!

480
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:02,780
- Shh.
- Can you hear me now?!

481
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,866
Your tacos are fucking great,

482
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,868
you crazy, fucking bitch.

483
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,202
Did you understand that?

484
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:10,705
You need to relax.

485
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:13,583
I'll relax when you stop
this shit and let us go.

486
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,877
And can I have my fucking
clothes back, please?

487
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:17,044
Shh. No, no, no.

488
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,213
- What the fuck are you doing, Kevin?
- Don't make her angry.

489
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:20,381
What the fuck is wrong with you?

490
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:21,591
- Listen.
- Huh?

491
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,259
Don't piss her off.
It's a fucking game.

492
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,969
All right, calm down.
Let's just enjoy a nice dinner.

493
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,263
Let's get back to the tacos.

494
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:30,308
You know, I use a lot of spices.
I make 'em real spicy.

495
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,310
If you use a meat
that's not the best,

496
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:36,147
covers it up real well.

497
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:37,982
You want some more
guacamole on your tacos?

498
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,400
No. I'm fine.

499
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:40,902
Here we go.
Come here.

500
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:44,155
I love guacamole.

501
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:45,990
Sadie, this is fucked up.

502
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:49,119
Eat it.

503
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,080
Right.

504
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,582
You know what I was just thinking?

505
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,251
I should start a taco stand.

506
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:59,378
That's what I should do.

507
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:00,922
I'd have to think of a
real good name for it,

508
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:04,592
something catchy.

509
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:09,055
Bootsie's Taco Stand.

510
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,641
By the way, Jennifer,
have you seen Bootsie?

511
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,518
I haven't seen that little doggy
since I started making dinner.

512
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,687
Bootsie!

513
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:18,397
Bootsie.

514
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,942
Where are you, little doggy?

515
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,818
Bootsie.

516
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:26,781
Bootsie, where are you, honey?

517
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,828
Oh, there he is.

518
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,705
Come here, doggy.

519
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,958
There's the little guy.

520
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:40,378
Mwah.

521
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,712
Oh.

522
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:44,674
Did you guys spit out your food?

523
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,968
I spent an awful lot of time
working on this dinner

524
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:51,969
for you guys to spit it out.

525
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:58,225
Aw, now, how could you think
I'd cook up little Bootsie here?

526
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,397
Huh?

527
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,357
I'm not some kind of animal.

528
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:06,612
How fucking long is this
going to go on, okay?

529
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:11,534
As long as it needs to.

530
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:15,371
I told you, Kevin, you scorned me.

531
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,708
You too, Jen.

532
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,168
This little dog,
on the other hand,

533
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,130
didn't do nothing to me.

534
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,298
He's a good puppy.

535
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,009
There you go.

536
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,010
There you go. Oh.

537
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,978
All units be advised,
we had an escape

538
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,105
from the correctional
facility in Logan County.

539
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:44,859
Suspect believed to be dangerous,
heading north.

540
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,739
5 on the way.

541
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,450
Dispatch, we've got
no sign of escapee,

542
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,286
and we've covered two
miles south of 105.

543
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,431
Now wake up, Kevin.

544
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,725
I want both of you to hear this.

545
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:21,562
Look what I found.

546
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:26,563
All kinds of stuff in this house.

547
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:35,822
Going to tell you guys a story
about when I was in the hospital.

548
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:40,081
They thought I was sick.

549
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:44,085
They wanted to cure me.

550
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,588
They explained to me that...

551
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,799
to change one's behavior,

552
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,719
you must change their
thinking pattern first.

553
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:58,474
They said that...

554
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,727
electricity was good for that.

555
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,854
They said it would cure me.

556
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:06,232
I don't know about that.

557
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,360
After their shocks, I'd just...

558
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:13,489
get so mad.

559
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,742
Mostly I'd just stare
out the window,

560
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:21,163
sometimes for hours.

561
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:24,750
If I really misbehaved,
they'd take me into this room,

562
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:28,087
and they'd give me shock
after shock after shock.

563
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:33,088
There was a certain point,
I guess I just stopped misbehaving.

564
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:35,219
I don't know if I was cured,

565
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,972
but I certainly didn't
feel like doing the things

566
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:42,973
that made 'em give me the shocks.

567
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:46,564
You two have misbehaved.

568
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:50,901
You need to be cured of
wanting to fuck each other.

569
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,695
All you need is...

570
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:53,863
a little electricity.

571
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,949
Oh, shit.

572
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,202
I forgot.

573
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:05,203
Could bite your tongue clean off
if you don't have protection.

574
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,877
Sadie, please let us go.

575
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,670
Shh now.

576
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,755
Shh!

577
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:13,507
It's all right.

578
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:16,302
Come on, you just...

579
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,636
please, you don't need to...

580
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:18,804
- Shh.
- Come on.

581
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,265
Okay.

582
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,476
What's that?

583
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:27,605
Oh, baby, you got a text.

584
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:30,107
It's from your mother.

585
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:32,776
Awful timing.

586
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:36,739
She's asking how we're enjoying
our weekend at the house.

587
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,949
I will respond for you.

588
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,579
"Sadie and I are having
an awesome time.

589
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,789
By the way,

590
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,959
are you still sucking Dad's dick?"

591
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:53,005
I put a little happy face.

592
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,090
Oh, Kevin, honey, come on.

593
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:57,092
You never did have
a sense of humor.

594
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,120
You fucking cunt!

595
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,998
You did all this because of
a fucking stupid affair?

596
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,166
It was nothing!

597
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,673
Jesus, Kevin, you're so hostile.

598
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,132
I'm just trying to help you.

599
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,843
Think of me as your doctor.

600
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,971
Oh, honey...

601
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,514
you peed your pants.

602
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:44,974
It's okay.
It happens.

603
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,433
Well, how do you feel, Kevin?

604
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:49,019
Do you feel like sticking your
dick into Jennifer anymore?

605
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,187
Let us go.

606
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:52,273
Oh, sure, yeah, honey.
I'll get right on that.

607
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:55,859
Would you like me to call
911 too while I'm at it?

608
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,321
I was in the hospital till I was 18.

609
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,365
I think you two are
getting off pretty easy.

610
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,367
Hasn't this gone on
for long enough?

611
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:08,368
What more are you
going to do to us?

612
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:09,832
I don't know, Jennifer.

613
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,209
I'm a girl.

614
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:17,210
I don't read the instructions.
I'm just kind of winging it here.

615
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,717
Ugh.

616
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:20,884
What the hell?

617
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,720
How do you fucking smoke
these things, baby?

618
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:24,096
They taste like shit.

619
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,641
Jeez.
Who the fuck is that?

620
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:33,897
Help! Help!
We're out here by the...

621
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:35,190
You two don't go anywhere.

622
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,525
Have a cigar.

623
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,529
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

624
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:51,957
Hi there.

625
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,459
Is Kevin here?

626
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,879
I mean, I saw his car.

627
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,631
Yes. Actually, he...

628
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,425
is in the shower.

629
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,344
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

630
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,179
I live next door.
I'm Rita.

631
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,348
I'm Sadie.

632
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,849
Nice to meet you.

633
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,601
- I'm Kevin's girlfriend.
- Oh.

634
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:12,770
Actually, his fiancee.

635
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,146
It's a secret.

636
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:15,814
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

637
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,941
Dear, I don't want
to bother you two.

638
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:20,069
I just want to leave
some of my chili.

639
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,947
It's been Kevin's favorite
since he was a kid.

640
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:26,325
- Has it, now?
- Yeah.

641
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:29,620
Well, how did you know
that chili is my favorite?

642
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,748
Kevin!

643
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:35,793
Rita just came over and
brought us some chili!

644
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:38,087
Why don't you come in
and have some with us?

645
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:41,423
Oh, dear, I've already
butted in too much already.

646
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:46,424
No, no, no.
Rita, I insist.

647
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:50,891
Bootsie!

648
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:52,142
Bootsie!

649
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:57,143
- Oh.
- Bootsie!

650
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,193
All units, suspect last seen

651
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:05,614
heading north of 415
toward Hilltop Road.

652
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,824
That's a copy, dispatch.

653
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:08,826
We've got units covering
the whole county.

654
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,078
We've also got the state
police assisting.

655
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:28,220
Why do dogs like to find
the muddiest puddles?

656
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:33,221
I swear they're just like men.

657
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:40,274
Oh, I don't know what
I would have done

658
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,109
if Bootsie got away.

659
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,694
He's never been to this house.

660
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,863
Oh.

661
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:50,864
You run along now.

662
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,714
I have a gun in my bedside table.

663
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:04,965
I'm swing to go get it.

664
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,675
Meant nothing?

665
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:07,843
Baby...

666
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:11,346
Just shut up and get the gun.

667
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:13,599
I love onions in my chili.

668
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,894
Won't you please stay
and have some with us?

669
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:19,855
Listen, dear, I still
remember what it was like

670
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,274
when I was a young girl.

671
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:26,236
You two don't need an old
coot like me around.

672
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:27,821
Tell Kevin I said hi.

673
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:30,822
Mm.

674
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,380
Looking for this?

675
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:46,924
All right, just...

676
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,760
Honey, you told me the gun
was in the drawer, remember?

677
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:51,929
Just put the fucking gun
down, okay?

678
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,639
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it hasn't.

679
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,350
Just come on!
Just stop it!

680
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:01,351
Kevin, get back downstairs.

681
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,919
Cumbersome motherfucker.

682
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,420
Damn.

683
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,674
I'll never see him again.

684
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:31,718
I promise you that, Sadie.

685
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,719
I have to teach you
to try not to escape.

686
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,102
No.

687
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:43,105
For God's sake...

688
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,190
Don't you know there is no God?

689
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,900
Or else why would he
let me do this to you?

690
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,235
No, please.

691
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:49,653
- Hey!
- Don't.

692
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,363
- Hey!
- No. No.

693
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,824
- Please!
- Don't fight it, cheater.

694
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,118
I have to punish you
so that you learn

695
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,119
not to loosen your
fingers like Kevin did.

696
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,292
Come on, Sadie, look at me.

697
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,544
It's me, Jen,

698
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:08,338
your best friend
since second grade.

699
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,384
I've learned my lesson,
I swear to God.

700
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:14,052
I told you.

701
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:16,221
There is no God.

702
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:19,349
That's why I have to do this to you.

703
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,810
You've lost your mind.

704
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:26,811
I don't see you in you anymore.

705
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,404
I don't know you.

706
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:37,200
You know, you're right, Jen.

707
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:42,201
Yeah, we're friends.

708
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,874
We were friends!

709
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,094
Ah, no.

710
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:27,394
How can you fucking do that to her?

711
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:29,312
Did you want to say something?

712
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:32,816
How can you do that to her?

713
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:35,318
Well, she's passed out now.
She doesn't feel anything.

714
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,656
You seem awfully protective of her.

715
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:41,074
I'm going to fucking kill you.

716
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:44,494
That's no way to talk to
the mother of your child.

717
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:48,999
No, I'm going to see to it
that you don't run away again.

718
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:54,379
Do you remember our
favorite movie, baby?

719
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,047
You got it on DVD.

720
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:59,801
Oh, we saw a lot of movies, Sadie.

721
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:04,802
Oh, I think it'll come to you.

722
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:10,683
Kathy Bates was very good in it.

723
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,530
"Misery."

724
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:25,327
What's the scene that
everybody remembers?

725
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,828
No.

726
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,247
You... you can't do that.

727
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:32,250
- It just creeped everybody out.
- No.

728
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,961
I think they called it hobbling.

729
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,755
No.

730
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,757
Okay.

731
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:40,550
You can't do this.

732
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:42,594
What I can't do

733
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:45,180
is have my man

734
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,140
try to run away from me again.

735
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:50,852
That's what I can't do.

736
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,229
- No.
- I'm sorry, honey.

737
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,564
This is... this is going to hurt.

738
00:44:54,565 --> 00:44:56,066
You're not going to...

739
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:58,902
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:02,072
Fuck!

741
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,788
- Jesus, fuck.
- Oh!

742
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:10,956
I'm sorry, baby.

743
00:45:10,957 --> 00:45:13,458
I'm sorry, Kevin.

744
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:16,211
I don't think I could
break the other one.

745
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:20,715
How the hell did she break
both of them in the movie?

746
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,259
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

747
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:50,453
Hey.

748
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:55,454
Been asleep for almost an hour.

749
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:01,506
Where is Kevin?

750
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:03,300
He's upstairs.

751
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:07,470
I felt really, really bad
after I crushed his ankle.

752
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,848
I wrapped it and gave
him some Vicodin.

753
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,391
He's totally knocked out.

754
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,854
Will you please let me go?

755
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,064
No.

756
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:20,191
You should take some of these.

757
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:23,028
I don't want to.

758
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:27,032
The pain in my hand
is just numb now.

759
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:29,367
Not for your hand.

760
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:33,371
Trust me.
You're going to want 'em.

761
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,373
Here. Here.

762
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:36,875
Drink, drink, drink.

763
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:45,884
When does this finish?

764
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:49,554
When I'm finished.

765
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:51,765
Did I...

766
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:55,602
ever tell you the story
about when my sister

767
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:59,439
took my little puppy's
love away from me?

768
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,526
What are you talking about?

769
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:07,238
I had just turned 11.

770
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,239
My dad bought me the
cutest little puppy.

771
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:16,539
My little sister

772
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,209
played with it...

773
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,671
and pet it...

774
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:27,467
until that little puppy started to
love her more than it loved me.

775
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:30,512
Maybe it didn't love her more.

776
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,097
Maybe you just thought that.

777
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:35,350
That's not true.

778
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,810
One night, I went in her room,

779
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:41,811
and that little puppy was sleeping,
curled up on her bed.

780
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:45,944
I told you I killed that puppy.

781
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:49,823
- That's why you went to the hospital.
- No.

782
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,784
I didn't kill the puppy.

783
00:47:52,785 --> 00:47:55,412
You didn't?

784
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,706
No.

785
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:00,458
See, I couldn't blame
my little puppy.

786
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:02,335
It wasn't his fault.

787
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:06,923
He didn't know no better.

788
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:10,260
It was my sister's fault.

789
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:12,470
So the next day,

790
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:17,471
she had a little
accident in the pool.

791
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:21,688
I helped her drown.

792
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,232
You told me you tried to save her.

793
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:27,652
I told everyone that.

794
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:32,653
It wasn't true, Jen.

795
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:39,039
What I didn't tell you is that
the police didn't believe me.

796
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,582
I was too young to go to jail,

797
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:45,583
so, you know, they could
only keep me till I was 18.

798
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:50,467
Listen, I've been thinking...

799
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:55,468
Kevin is a lot like
my little puppy was.

800
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,349
I can't really blame him,
you know?

801
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,311
You and me, we always said
that men are like dogs.

802
00:49:01,312 --> 00:49:03,396
Someone just smiles at 'em,

803
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:08,026
they'll jump up and
sleep in their bed.

804
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:11,071
You...

805
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:16,072
are beautiful, Jennifer.

806
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:22,745
You have the most beautiful smile.

807
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,221
Maybe if my sister...

808
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:40,725
wasn't so pretty, my little puppy
would have stayed with me.

809
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:43,728
You're beautiful, Sadie.

810
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:45,522
Not as pretty a smile as Jennifer.

811
00:49:45,523 --> 00:49:46,940
That's not true.

812
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:50,193
When we're at bars, guys always
want your number first.

813
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:53,905
Let's not beat around the bush.

814
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:56,116
Your dad's a dentist.

815
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:57,408
Your teeth are perfect.

816
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:59,869
I'm just going to chip one of 'em.

817
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,121
What?

818
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,083
Yeah. It'll work better
if you hold still.

819
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:06,251
Hey!

820
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:08,169
Hold still.
It'll go easier.

821
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,712
Just stop struggling.

822
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:11,506
I'm not going to
pull out your tooth.

823
00:50:11,507 --> 00:50:14,008
I'm just going to chip it.

824
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,683
You do have nice teeth.

825
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:26,684
Sorry, I must have
nicked your gums.

826
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:32,527
I guess you're kind of pissed,
aren't you?

827
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:42,013
Green tea's ready.

828
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:46,643
Just don't forget the lemon!

829
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:51,147
Two sugars, right?

830
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:54,108
Oh! Bootsie.

831
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:55,735
Oh, honey.

832
00:51:55,736 --> 00:51:57,403
Have you not had dinner yet?

833
00:51:57,404 --> 00:51:59,280
I'm so sorry.

834
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:04,281
Here, have some chili.

835
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,163
Oh, and, Kevin,

836
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:12,164
you're going to love the little
polka-dotted dress I got for you.

837
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:24,889
Didn't have any lemon,
so I had to use...

838
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,851
lemon juice.

839
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,980
Kevin, you look so pathetic.

840
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,530
There, silly Willy.

841
00:52:40,531 --> 00:52:45,531
All yours.

842
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,918
Kevin, you're never
getting out of here.

843
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:58,919
You're all mine.

844
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,137
Hmm.

845
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:07,390
Do you like my dress?

846
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:09,309
You think it's pretty on me?

847
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,770
I brought it up here to
surprise you this weekend.

848
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:17,525
Now I want you to take a good look.

849
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:22,526
Get this picture of my
sexy panties in your mind.

850
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:36,461
What are you going to do with that?

851
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:41,462
Baby, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

852
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:45,553
It wasn't your fault.

853
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:48,473
You know, you cheating
on me with Jennifer.

854
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:51,684
She was cute and sexy.

855
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:54,479
And once you laid your eyes on her,

856
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,191
it was impossible
for you to resist.

857
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,526
But I have a way

858
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:04,155
to make that never
happen for us again.

859
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:07,283
You have wandering eyes, Kevin,

860
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:11,162
and that's not good for
our relationship, baby.

861
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:13,164
Haven't you done enough?

862
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:14,791
All right? Come on.
I learned my lesson.

863
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:15,958
Just please don't.

864
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:18,503
I gave you the image
of the sexy underwear.

865
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:20,171
Don't take my eyes.

866
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:23,174
Now I'm just going to take
your wandering eyes away.

867
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:24,967
- No, please.
- Just be quiet now.

868
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:26,969
- Shh.
- Not my eyes.

869
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:29,680
Just please don't take... please.

870
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:30,848
Don't, don't.
Don't, please.

871
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:34,560
Don't take my fucking eyes!

872
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,561
Not my eyes.

873
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:45,154
Come on.
Come on.

874
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:52,203
- No!
- Jeez, baby.

875
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:54,705
I wasn't trying to kill you,
just trying to blind you.

876
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:14,058
Fucking bitch, no!

877
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:22,775
Dispatch, this is unit 26.

878
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:27,776
Motorist possibly spotted suspect
heading north of Sherwood.

879
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:38,416
Better, you big baby?

880
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,719
You're a fucking animal.

881
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,972
I can barely see.

882
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:57,101
That's the idea, silly.

883
00:55:57,102 --> 00:55:58,811
All right.

884
00:55:58,812 --> 00:56:02,523
Here is some Vicodin...

885
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:04,984
for your pain.

886
00:56:04,985 --> 00:56:06,527
Here's hot tea.

887
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:09,906
Careful.
It's still a little warm.

888
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:14,907
Careful, baby.
Don't burn your lips.

889
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:20,500
I think you've learned your lesson.

890
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:27,169
I'm going to go check on Jen.

891
00:56:52,741 --> 00:56:55,034
You still here?

892
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,745
Please...

893
00:56:57,746 --> 00:56:59,288
help me.

894
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:01,874
I came down here to inform you

895
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:06,087
that apparently Kevin doesn't
miss you anymore at all.

896
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,672
That's okay.

897
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:12,673
I just want to go home.

898
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:16,514
Oh, that's not for you.

899
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:18,558
There's a boat down at the lake.

900
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,476
Got to fill it with gas.

901
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:23,145
We're going boating.

902
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:25,856
I know you don't like the water.

903
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:29,777
Quite frankly, I've had some
lousy luck with it myself.

904
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:34,778
But I hear drowning is
a painless way to go.

905
00:57:36,368 --> 00:57:39,120
At least I hope so.

906
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:44,121
My poor little sister.

907
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:13,321
If you let me go now,

908
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,531
I won't tell anyone,

909
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:17,533
like this never happened.

910
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:18,993
Let you go?

911
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,995
Come on, Jennifer.
You think I'm crazy?

912
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:22,163
Yeah.

913
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,415
You know what?
You are crazy.

914
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,459
You're a fucking psycho bitch!

915
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,419
What more could you
do to me, Sadie?

916
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:32,048
Kill me?

917
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:35,092
That's what you plan
on doing, right?

918
00:58:35,093 --> 00:58:36,886
We're friends.

919
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:39,597
I thought I knew you.

920
00:58:39,598 --> 00:58:42,350
Nobody knew you, Sadie.

921
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,894
I slept with Kevin.
Get over it.

922
00:58:44,895 --> 00:58:49,895
It's not the end of the
fucking world, okay?!

923
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:53,819
You're a drama queen.

924
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,697
Sit down, drama queen.

925
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:59,698
Jesus.

926
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:20,888
Come on, baby.

927
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:32,896
Come on, fucker.

928
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,043
Hey.

929
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:35,755
Help! Help!

930
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:40,301
Jennifer, get in the car
or I'll blow your tits off.

931
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:48,058
<i>Does love die...</i>

932
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,895
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

933
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:52,563
Yeah, well, it sure did, didn't it?

934
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:56,484
<i>- Or will two hearts...</i>
- Oh.

935
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:59,403
- It's Kevin and my song.
<i>- Be there forever?</i>

936
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:02,531
- Ironic.
<i>- Can stolen love...</i>

937
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:05,910
I just never thought
Kevin was right for you.

938
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:09,955
I don't know that I'm
right for anyone.

939
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:14,460
Maybe that's not true.

940
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:16,670
Maybe there is one person.

941
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:21,175
Yeah?
Who would that be?

942
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:23,636
Me.

943
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:26,305
<i>A hurt so deep</i>

944
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:29,099
- I tried to tell you.
<i>- Will always be...</i>

945
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,063
I've always seen your magic, Sadie.

946
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:38,484
Haven't I always been
there when you needed me?

947
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:40,277
What if I told you

948
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:43,155
I loved you?

949
01:01:43,156 --> 01:01:44,990
Everything I did

950
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:47,284
I did to get closer to you.

951
01:01:49,746 --> 01:01:51,330
That'd be a real
fucking complication,

952
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:55,292
wouldn't it be?

953
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:58,963
I don't want to die, Sadie.

954
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:02,132
Part of me doesn't want that either.

955
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:05,177
<i>Can stolen love live...</i>

956
01:02:05,178 --> 01:02:06,470
Sadie.

957
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:09,265
<i>To be returned?</i>

958
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:10,474
No.

959
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:13,811
<i>Does love die then</i>

960
01:02:13,812 --> 01:02:18,812
<i>- Or do we want to know?</i>
- Sadie.

961
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,070
<i>Does love die?</i>

962
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:33,998
<i>Does love die?</i>

963
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:36,834
Shit!

964
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:39,336
<i>Does love die?</i>

965
01:02:39,337 --> 01:02:41,797
Fucking song wasn't even over.

966
01:03:05,113 --> 01:03:07,448
You don't really listen, do you?

967
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:11,285
You know what, Sadie?

968
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:15,497
Go ahead and kill me already.

969
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:18,709
That's your plan, isn't it...

970
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:22,546
you flat-chested whore?

971
01:03:22,547 --> 01:03:25,049
You know why I was
your only friend?

972
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:28,552
Nobody liked you.

973
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:30,471
Everyone thought you were a freak.

974
01:03:30,472 --> 01:03:33,057
Everyone thought you were nuts.

975
01:03:33,058 --> 01:03:37,603
The guys knew you'd put out,
so they went out with you.

976
01:03:37,604 --> 01:03:40,731
That's all you were good for, Sadie,

977
01:03:40,732 --> 01:03:43,732
good for an easy lay.

978
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:01,831
You said you loved me, Jennifer.

979
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:05,422
Or were you just lying
when you said that?

980
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:08,008
Fuck...

981
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,427
you.

982
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:12,137
Ah

983
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:15,265
am rescinding my request for
you to be my maid of honor!

984
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,430
Die!

985
01:04:53,304 --> 01:04:57,266
What the fuck?

986
01:04:57,267 --> 01:05:00,894
You're a tough fuck to kill.

987
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:05,895
I'll be right back.

988
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:15,534
What's going on?

989
01:05:15,535 --> 01:05:17,036
Where were you guys
10 minutes ago

990
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:18,871
when I was changing my tire?

991
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:21,040
Can you check my tire
and make sure it's okay?

992
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:23,500
Sure.

993
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:27,838
Looks good.

994
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,131
Where you headed?

995
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:31,383
Oh, just went to get
some cigarettes,

996
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:33,343
head back to the house
and my boyfriend.

997
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:35,888
Shady habit.

998
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:37,973
The cigarettes, not my boyfriend.

999
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:39,892
There was an escape just
a few miles from here.

1000
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,853
We have extra squads out.
We'll find this guy.

1001
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:45,439
Once you get home, make
sure you lock your doors.

1002
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,858
If you see anybody or anything
that looks out of place,

1003
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:49,610
you call 911, okay?

1004
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:51,320
Thank you, Officer, both of you.

1005
01:05:51,321 --> 01:05:52,696
Thanks for the warning.

1006
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:55,199
Help.

1007
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,200
What the hell?

1008
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:07,461
Help, help...

1009
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:07,962
Help.

1010
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:25,767
What the...

1011
01:06:27,065 --> 01:06:29,066
There really is a God after all.

1012
01:06:32,028 --> 01:06:35,030
Jeez.

1013
01:07:35,466 --> 01:07:36,800
Need a lift?

1014
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:41,801
I sure do.

1015
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,945
Buckle up.

1016
01:07:56,946 --> 01:08:00,866
Didn't think anybody'd stop
for me on a night like this.

1017
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:03,493
Guess it's your lucky day.

1018
01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:04,828
Car break down?

1019
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:09,333
Uh, yeah, couple miles back there.

1020
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:10,918
How far you going?

1021
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:13,337
Wherever you're heading, I guess.

1022
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:17,299
I ran into some cops back there.

1023
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,300
They said a man escaped
from prison not far from here.

1024
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:27,597
I didn't know they had
a prison around here.

1025
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:33,065
I bet men in prison don't...

1026
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:35,859
get a lot of pussy.

1027
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,737
Guess not.

1028
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:43,242
Bet it's been a while for you, too.

1029
01:08:43,243 --> 01:08:46,662
Don't try to figure this out.

1030
01:08:46,663 --> 01:08:51,663
I'm just a crazy, horny bitch.

1031
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:59,299
Really, really horny.

1032
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:04,012
Oh, God. Oh.

1033
01:09:04,013 --> 01:09:05,472
Come on.

1034
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:10,473
I want you to come.
I want you to come.

1035
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:35,585
Oh, baby.

1036
01:09:35,586 --> 01:09:36,753
That was great.

1037
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:40,841
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it was.

1038
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:42,676
I want to thank you.

1039
01:09:42,677 --> 01:09:45,262
Oh, baby, you just did thank me.

1040
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:46,930
No...

1041
01:09:46,931 --> 01:09:50,434
I want to thank you for my alibi.

1042
01:10:07,076 --> 01:10:12,076
You get me all messy.

1043
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:15,874
Okay.

1044
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,219
Buckle up.

1045
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,220
Okay.

1046
01:10:58,336 --> 01:11:00,003
Kevin!

1047
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:05,004
Honey, I'm back!

1048
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:21,356
Shit.

1049
01:11:57,562 --> 01:12:00,562
Kevin.

1050
01:12:03,276 --> 01:12:06,403
Baby, where are you?

1051
01:12:06,404 --> 01:12:08,905
Show your face.

1052
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:25,336
Damn.

1053
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:34,973
Damn it. Fuck.

1054
01:12:46,402 --> 01:12:49,402
Oh!

1055
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:38,662
Hey!

1056
01:13:38,663 --> 01:13:42,332
Eh! No!

1057
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:45,333
No!

1058
01:14:40,558 --> 01:14:45,558
Oh, Kevin.

1059
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:54,066
I forgive you now.

1060
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,530
I really do.

1061
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:01,050
He tried to drive away after
killing my friends and raping me.

1062
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:10,228
Bang.

1063
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:20,403
And you crushed my
hand in the vise.

1064
01:16:24,328 --> 01:16:26,329
Ah, shit.

1065
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:31,330
This is going to hurt.

1066
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:04,325
Fuck.

1067
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:05,952
Fuck.

1068
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:08,371
Fuck, that really hurt.

1069
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,040
Fuck.

1070
01:17:15,546 --> 01:17:17,839
911. What is your emergency?

1071
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,009
This man came to the house.

1072
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:23,386
He killed my boyfriend.

1073
01:17:23,387 --> 01:17:25,054
He raped me.

1074
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:26,556
I'm sending help.

1075
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:28,391
I'm notifying the paramedics.

1076
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:30,518
Please, you got to send someone.

1077
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:33,188
Help is on the way.
Is the man still there?

1078
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:35,523
Oh, uh, yes.

1079
01:17:35,524 --> 01:17:37,776
- Yes, he is.
- Where is the man now?

1080
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:39,736
He's dead.

1081
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:40,904
Uh...

1082
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:43,239
I managed to find a
revolver in the house

1083
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,241
and... and shoot him.

1084
01:17:45,242 --> 01:17:48,411
Okay. Just stay calm.

1085
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:51,873
I'm hurt really badly.
Please send... please send someone.

1086
01:17:51,874 --> 01:17:53,416
Just stay with me, honey.

1087
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:56,419
I've got the paramedics
and police on the way.

1088
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,087
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1089
01:17:58,088 --> 01:18:01,088
Fuck.

1090
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,827
I have to ask you a few
questions, sweetheart.

1091
01:18:28,828 --> 01:18:32,622
It's very important.
Are you allergic to any medicines?

1092
01:18:32,623 --> 01:18:35,375
Okay, because of your injuries,
I have to ask you.

1093
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:38,962
Are you pregnant?

1094
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:41,464
No, I'm not pregnant.

1095
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:43,800
Okay, we're going to get you to
the hospital as quick as we can.

1096
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,553
- Doctors are waiting.
- Thank you.

1097
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:48,137
Found this dog.

1098
01:18:48,138 --> 01:18:49,806
Poor thing was hiding
in the back room.

1099
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:52,934
Bootsie!
There you are, sweetie.

1100
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:55,103
I'm so glad that man
didn't hurt you.

1101
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:57,355
Oh.

1102
01:18:57,356 --> 01:18:59,190
Oh, you must still be scared.

1103
01:18:59,191 --> 01:19:00,692
That's okay, baby.
Mama's here.

1104
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,777
Mama's here. I love you.

1105
01:19:02,778 --> 01:19:05,238
We'll take the dog.
We'll take good care of her.

1106
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:10,239
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1107
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,831
And, Sheriff...

1108
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:19,832
I just wanted to ask
you a question.

1109
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:23,172
Was he the man who
escaped from prison?

1110
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:26,092
Yeah, we think it was.

1111
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:28,303
You were very brave
to do what you did.

1112
01:19:28,304 --> 01:19:30,471
You saved your life.

1113
01:19:30,472 --> 01:19:34,851
Yeah, I just wish I could
have saved my boyfriend.

1114
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:39,439
You made it.
You'll be okay now.

1115
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,192
Yeah.

1116
01:19:43,193 --> 01:19:48,193
I think I will.

1117
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:01,294
I'll never get it.

1118
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:03,463
Longer I'm on the job,

1119
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,506
the more it baffles me.

1120
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:07,675
I just hope that poor girl...

1121
01:20:07,676 --> 01:20:12,676
she can get through all this.

1122
01:20:34,244 --> 01:20:36,788
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi, honey.

1123
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,917
Oh, and you, too, Bootsie.

1124
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:43,044
Can I get you anything?

1125
01:20:43,045 --> 01:20:48,045
I'll have an iced tea, please.

1126
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:51,344
Nice ass.

1127
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:53,763
Sadie, you're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

1128
01:20:53,764 --> 01:20:56,391
The whole wide world and
parts of the universe, too?

1129
01:20:56,392 --> 01:20:58,893
Most parts.

1130
01:20:58,894 --> 01:21:00,186
I love you, Sadie.

1131
01:21:00,187 --> 01:21:03,231
You do?

1132
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,108
So you'd never cheat on me?

1133
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:07,235
A guy would have to be crazy
to even look at another woman

1134
01:21:07,236 --> 01:21:08,778
when he's got a girl
as great as you.

1135
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:11,531
I suppose you're right.

1136
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,408
Besides, if you cheated on me,

1137
01:21:13,409 --> 01:21:17,954
I'd have to kill you.

1138
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:21,791
Hey, why are the cute
ones always taken?

1139
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:25,086
Not always.

1140
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:35,054
<i>All I know is he's for me</i>

1141
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:39,100
<i>Going to be the girl</i>

1142
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:42,687
<i>And he's going
to be the boy</i>

1143
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:47,688
<i>That puts her in a whirl</i>

1144
01:21:48,277 --> 01:21:52,071
<i>Some say she's crazy</i>

1145
01:21:52,072 --> 01:21:55,825
<i>Some say she's not so bad</i>

1146
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:59,704
<i>I say she's maybe</i>

1147
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:02,206
<i>Everything he needs</i>

1148
01:22:02,207 --> 01:22:06,127
<i>All I know is he's the one</i>

1149
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:09,964
<i>Love is always strong</i>

1150
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:13,676
<i>But it isn't always love</i>

1151
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:18,677
<i>That's the name of the song</i>

1152
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:22,852
<i>Some say she's crazy</i>

1153
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:26,939
<i>Some say she's not so bad</i>

1154
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,735
<i>I say she's maybe</i>

1155
01:22:30,736 --> 01:22:33,321
<i>Everything he needs</i>

1156
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:38,076
<i>All I know is he's the one</i>

1157
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:41,871
<i>He's the one</i>

1158
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:45,875
<i>He's the one</i>

1159
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:49,712
<i>He's the one</i>

1160
01:22:49,713 --> 01:22:53,549
<i>He's the one</i>

1161
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,635
<i>He's the one.</i>

1162
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:03,935
<i>Step a little
bit closer, baby</i>

1163
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:08,564
<i>Now, do you like
what you see?</i>

1164
01:23:08,565 --> 01:23:11,109
<i>If you're going to be
playing these games</i>

1165
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:15,571
<i>Then you're never
going to get with me</i>

1166
01:23:15,572 --> 01:23:18,199
<i>Look a little
bit wiser, baby</i>

1167
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,745
<i>I see nervousness
in your eyes</i>

1168
01:23:22,746 --> 01:23:25,248
<i>if you want to
approach me, baby</i>

1169
01:23:25,249 --> 01:23:29,877
<i>You need to learn
to be smooth and sly</i>

1170
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:32,880
<i>Tell me what you
really want from me</i>

1171
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:36,926
<i>I've heard that
pickup line before</i>

1172
01:23:36,927 --> 01:23:39,720
<i>If you think you've won
my goods, baby</i>

1173
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:44,016
<i>Then I'll lead you
to the fucking door</i>

1174
01:23:44,017 --> 01:23:47,061
<i>Tell me what you
want to do with me</i>

1175
01:23:47,062 --> 01:23:51,190
<i>I am far from that type</i>

1176
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:54,110
<i>Just because I wear
the clothes real tight</i>

1177
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:58,281
<i>It doesn't mean you're going
to get the goods tonight</i>

1178
01:23:58,282 --> 01:24:00,783
<i>Breathe a tiny
bit slower, baby</i>

1179
01:24:00,784 --> 01:24:05,538
<i>I feel desperation
taking over you</i>

1180
01:24:05,539 --> 01:24:08,291
<i>if only you could
feel me out</i>

1181
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:12,628
<i>Would you understand
my point of view</i>

1182
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:15,298
<i>Take the time
to know my name</i>

1183
01:24:15,299 --> 01:24:19,844
<i>'Cause you're not
going to win this game</i>

1184
01:24:19,845 --> 01:24:22,305
<i>I like to take
it nice and slow</i>

1185
01:24:22,306 --> 01:24:26,767
<i>So get out of
the fast lane</i>

1186
01:24:26,768 --> 01:24:29,729
<i>Tell me what you
really want from me</i>

1187
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:33,858
<i>I've heard that
pickup line before</i>

1188
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:36,652
<i>If you think you've won
my goods, baby</i>

1189
01:24:36,653 --> 01:24:40,948
<i>Then I'll lead you
to the fucking door</i>

1190
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:43,951
<i>Tell me what you
want to do with me</i>

1191
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:48,164
<i>I am far from that type</i>

1192
01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:51,083
<i>Just because I wear
the clothes real tight</i>

1193
01:24:51,084 --> 01:24:56,084
<i>It doesn't mean you're going
to get the goods tonight</i>

1194
01:25:20,072 --> 01:25:23,491
<i>So I'll say it again</i>

1195
01:25:23,492 --> 01:25:26,577
<i>Tell me what you really
want from me</i>

1196
01:25:26,578 --> 01:25:30,748
<i>I've heard that pickup
line before</i>

1197
01:25:30,749 --> 01:25:33,459
<i>If you think you've won
my goods, baby</i>

1198
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:37,838
<i>Then I'll lead you
to the fucking door</i>

1199
01:25:37,839 --> 01:25:40,883
<i>Tell me what you want
to do with me</i>

1200
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:44,971
<i>I am far from that type</i>

1201
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:47,974
<i>Just because I wear
the clothes real tight</i>

1202
01:25:47,975 --> 01:25:52,975
<i>It doesn't mean you're going
to get the goods tonight.</i>
