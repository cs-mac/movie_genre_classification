1
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,832
What do you think?

2
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,073
Yeah, it's good. How much was it?

3
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:44,825
$1,000.

4
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:46,744
Top of the line.

5
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,217
So when are you leaving?

6
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:51,064
Tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,948
I promised the kids
I'd take them hunting in Ireland.

8
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,766
Listen...

9
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:26,455
I gotta talk to you about something.

10
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:30,199
I've been meaning to tell you
for a while now.

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,558
I'm gonna quit. I'm gonna get out.

12
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,078
I'm gonna sell my shares
and start from scratch.

13
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,206
Besides, I don't really think
you even need me anymore.

14
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:43,446
I think you'll be all right.

15
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,212
It's not the best time.

16
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,430
Well, listen,

17
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:52,405
I thought it over quite a bit,
and there's nothing else I can do.

18
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:55,221
I'm so far in debt with these people,

19
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:57,110
it's what I have to do.

20
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,733
Have you found a buyer?

21
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:00,693
Yeah.

22
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:03,156
It's a company called Golden Eagle.

23
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,662
Out of Singapore.

24
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:07,093
I borrowed an awful lot
of money from these people,

25
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,165
and this is the best way
for me to pay back my debt.

26
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,052
You're still gonna be running things.

27
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:13,685
I already worked out part of the deal-out.

28
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:15,764
I know Golden Eagle.

29
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,263
They're not that reputable.

30
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,797
Well, they did me a lot of favors,

31
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:27,541
but it was not like there
was anything ever illegal.

32
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,427
It was nothing like that.

33
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,924
No.

34
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:35,960
No. Nothing illegal.

35
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:45,366
Answer it.

36
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,552
It's for you.

37
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,784
Hello?

38
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:04,636
Yeah. L'll send somebody else to get you.

39
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,465
Sandra's here.

40
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:14,580
You're still seeing her?

41
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,810
Well, not really.

42
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,433
- We talked once.
- Once too many.

43
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,833
You preferred the wife, didn't you?

44
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,625
I did.

45
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,458
I didn't.

46
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:31,633
Sandra's out in the waiting area,
so would you go get her for me?

47
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,584
- Sure.
- Okay.

48
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:34,929
The Golden Eagle contract just arrived.

49
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,849
Listen...

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,657
Andre has all the information,
and he's gonna start asking questions,

51
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:43,216
so just give him answers, okay?

52
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:45,007
There's not gonna be any more
secrets around here.

53
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,288
Okay.

54
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,949
Thank you.

55
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:57,234
Mr. Rennberg's waiting for you.
Will you follow me, please?

56
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:18,735
Thanks for seeing me.

57
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,658
Thanks for not taking my messages.

58
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:26,449
Well, I'm here.

59
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:33,144
Yeah, two months late.

60
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,999
I thought we broke up.

61
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,752
I guess we kind of did that
a couple of times.

62
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:47,694
I'd like to do it once and for all.

63
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:50,388
Whatever makes you happy.

64
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:56,589
Your cufflinks?

65
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,607
Yeah.

66
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,672
Is it because we're separated
that I'm allowed into your office now?

67
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,132
How old are they?

68
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,819
11 and 13.

69
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,507
They're good-looking kids.

70
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,851
Yeah.

71
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:30,251
I did a nice job with them, I think.

72
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:33,076
But your wife...

73
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,245
It's funny.

74
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:45,461
Before, it would've been painful
to see these pictures.

75
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,386
I'm divorced.

76
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:52,299
I don't hardly see those kids anymore.

77
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,210
Your divorce went through?

78
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:57,129
A month ago.

79
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,889
Congratulations.

80
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:05,901
I see. That's why you
started calling again.

81
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,177
You know very well why
we never met in this office before.

82
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,855
Because of the favors I used to do for you.

83
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:24,651
When I used to play "escort girl"
for your clients.

84
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:27,113
Yeah.

85
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,898
I used to come and tell you
everything I heard.

86
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:33,736
And everything I did...

87
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:35,913
Yeah?

88
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:39,144
I'm sure you never asked your wife
to do such things.

89
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:43,368
Well, you were very good at what you do.

90
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,304
And you got paid...
quite well as I remember.

91
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:52,048
Yeah, 'cause it turned you on
to pay me for that.

92
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,897
You know, sometimes I made things up.

93
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:08,785
I'd rather not know.

94
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,256
I would never do it again.

95
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,093
I'm starting to get that impression.

96
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,685
Do you know why I did it?

97
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,795
No, I don't. I'm mystified.

98
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:33,104
I did it because I loved you.

99
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,036
Then I suppose that means
you don't anymore. Is that it?

100
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,189
No.

101
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,849
You're lying.

102
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:01,412
Anyway, not enough
to do that shit anymore.

103
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,884
I didn't have a clue.

104
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:06,768
I would've done anything for you.

105
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,340
And you did.

106
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:14,344
Because I believed in our relationship.

107
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,724
You were just taking advantage of me.

108
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:21,859
Took advantage of you?

109
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,595
I could've picked up a $2.00 hooker
off the street

110
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:30,380
to do the same fucking thing!

111
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,887
Well, you wouldn't have
gotten such good info.

112
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:40,259
I didn't give a damn about the info.

113
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,994
You think some sweaty, drunken,
half-hard businessman

114
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:49,478
is gonna tell you anything important
at 3:00 in the morning?

115
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,954
Sure, I thought, maybe once in a while

116
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:57,838
there'd be a small piece of information.

117
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:03,433
Give me an edge on a business deal.

118
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,649
So...

119
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,625
it was all a game for you.

120
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,669
If that's what you want to call it.

121
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,608
Yeah. That's what I want to call it.

122
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,008
You know, you're not a fool.

123
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,696
You weren't tricked into doing anything.

124
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:33,408
You got off on every bit of that
just as much as I did, and you know it.

125
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,584
I don't know.

126
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:37,696
Got into what?

127
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:42,027
You enjoyed doing what
I wanted you to do.

128
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,983
You liked it. You liked being mine.

129
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,874
Being yours?

130
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,770
Yeah.

131
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,407
You remember that weekend?

132
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:57,640
We went away and we made up
a little game where'd you be my slave.

133
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,412
Say the word slave again.

134
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,174
Slave.

135
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,838
Again.

136
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,791
Slave.

137
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,613
Again.

138
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:15,038
I think you liked doing
what I wanted you to do,

139
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,798
and you got off on it.

140
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,350
I was doing a bunch of drugs.

141
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,972
I didn't feel much. I was numb.

142
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,213
That's a bad excuse.

143
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:34,112
All right. I felt this much.

144
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:39,779
The truth is you didn't give a shit.

145
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,580
You could barely get it up.

146
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,653
Well,

147
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:51,677
you'd get hard when you told me
what we are going to do,

148
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:55,015
but less when we actually did it.

149
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,831
Can't you take that later?

150
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:16,511
Okay.

151
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:36,027
You know how much I miss you?

152
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,522
For the wrong reasons.

153
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:41,477
You shouldn't insist.

154
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,397
You just don't want to give in, that's all.

155
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:54,393
I don't want to end up like we were.

156
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:57,436
It's so hard to get out of it.

157
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,649
So you got out of it?

158
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,856
I don't think about you anymore.

159
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,136
I think about you less.

160
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:16,088
Anyway, I've got a new job now,
so there's no time for that.

161
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,051
Okay. You've got a job. Doing what?

162
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,944
Do you remember Lester and Sue Wang?

163
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:24,760
We had dinner with them
a couple times, right?

164
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,359
Yeah, I work with them.

165
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,887
They bought contemporary furniture
from Kwantung.

166
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:33,054
Whatever happened to that
science-fiction website you had?

167
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:36,545
That was so dumb.

168
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,503
It was not dumb. It was good.

169
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,487
What was the name of that
character you invented?

170
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:46,272
- Vortex?
- Yeah, Vortex.

171
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:53,846
Vortex could put out her hand
and control people, right?

172
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:56,151
Why don't you do that right now?

173
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,168
Stick out your hand.

174
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,646
Come to my place tomorrow night.

175
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,203
There were two containers on the ship.

176
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:11,222
This is one.
Where is my other container?

177
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,811
Well, it'll be here tomorrow.

178
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,346
I spoke to the freighter.
He says he's sorry.

179
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,074
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm sorry, too.

180
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:18,546
There's four crates at the PHV.

181
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:21,339
Put them on the platform,
deliver them this afternoon, okay?

182
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,936
Fax this to Hong Kong immediately.

183
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:12,085
Okay.

184
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,589
We have to change shippers.

185
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,480
This is the third screw-up.

186
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:30,383
Put the ones with red stickers aside.
It's a different order.

187
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:31,472
No, it's fine.

188
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,319
It's okay. I told them.
They know. Don't worry.

189
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,463
Are you sure you want to leave?

190
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,479
Is it the money?

191
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,303
No, it's not the money. It's just...

192
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,854
I told you it was temporary
and, um...

193
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,998
Did someone offer you another job?

194
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,079
No, I'm probably going to leave Paris.

195
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,753
Look, these are the four items
that are missing,

196
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:53,358
everything's fine,
and I signed here for you.

197
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,886
The last page right here?

198
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,038
Still needs to be checked.

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,430
But Bruno said he'll do it later.

200
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:04,077
So is Miles going to help you?

201
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,810
Miles?

202
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:09,037
You're seeing him again, right?

203
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,309
How do you know?

204
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,833
His secretary called
to confirm your appointment.

205
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:19,309
Why? I saw him once.

206
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,837
I thought you made up your mind.

207
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:24,396
I did. I made up my mind.

208
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:28,880
And he was supposed to be all of your life?

209
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,333
He's out of it.

210
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:37,516
- This is the last time.
- Too risky.

211
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,372
Next week l'll be gone.

212
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,620
Where to?

213
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,508
China.

214
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:45,715
Beijing. I'm buying into a club.

215
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,108
With what money?

216
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,678
Don't worry.

217
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,652
You'd live there?

218
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,596
In a second.

219
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,681
I swear, a second.

220
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,478
Here.

221
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,580
After, l'll send you a signal like this.

222
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,317
I want to go away too.

223
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,814
But I couldn't go alone.

224
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,379
I won't be alone.

225
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,560
Who are you going with?

226
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,722
Where's Sandra?

227
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,024
Where is Sandra?

228
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,752
In the booth down there.

229
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:04,874
Does she have the package?

230
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,056
No.

231
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,112
Where is the package?

232
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:09,096
It's in the car under my seat.

233
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:11,560
My motorcycle is
over there behind the bank.

234
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:15,661
Take the motorcycle
and get out of here.

235
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,284
Got the cash?

236
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:25,458
Can I see?

237
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,997
Let go of me!

238
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,516
Let go!

239
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,357
Don't move.

240
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,279
Fuck!

241
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,398
Well, I'm doing what I can.

242
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,405
What?

243
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:48,509
How long?
How long have you been doing this?

244
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,558
What, like, you pretend
like you didn't know now?

245
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,646
I don't fucking know.

246
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,201
If I knew, I'd fire you.

247
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,809
I thought you loved me.

248
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,480
You know I do.

249
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,952
Just don't fuck with me, all right?

250
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:34,789
Don't do this to me.

251
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:08,066
Check tomorrow's paper.

252
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:12,124
Okay.

253
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,365
Where were you?

254
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,797
Playing poker.

255
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,110
All night?

256
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:53,531
Yes.

257
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,503
Win or lose?

258
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,708
Lose.

259
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,947
How much?

260
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:11,999
Enough.

261
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,524
They dropped off the tickets.

262
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:26,131
Call my wife and make sure
she got the reservations for the boys.

263
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:29,524
Everything should be okay.

264
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,600
Hang on. I gotta get the door.

265
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:50,162
Listen,

266
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:53,970
I'd like you to keep working for me,
if you'll think about it.

267
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,794
You can stay with André if you want.

268
00:25:55,795 --> 00:26:00,594
But l'll miss you,
and you need to come if you'd like.

269
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:03,484
We'll have fun. Good-bye.

270
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:08,913
You brought your keys.

271
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,356
I brought them back to you.

272
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,129
You brought them back to me.

273
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,753
The keychain was a gift.

274
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:18,993
I'm returning it.

275
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,009
Were you on the phone?

276
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,413
Yeah. I just hung up.

277
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,319
You want a whiskey?

278
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,432
No.

279
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,061
Well, I'm gonna have one.

280
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,480
You sure I can't get you something?

281
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:38,298
No, I won't stay long.

282
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,904
I shouldn't have come here.

283
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,887
I'm regretting it already.

284
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:50,997
I think you came here
because it's dangerous.

285
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:00,507
I'm gonna get some ice.

286
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:22,542
Are you hungry?

287
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:25,270
No.

288
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:40,237
I got Lebanese.

289
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:42,476
For two?

290
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:45,334
Of course.

291
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,846
Looks pretty good.
You might change your mind.

292
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:57,420
You said you'd lend me money.

293
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,692
A few months went by,
I don't know what happened.

294
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:01,840
Maybe you forgot.

295
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:06,155
A million dollars is pretty hard to forget.

296
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:08,843
That's an awful lot of money.

297
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:09,995
Not for you.

298
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:13,453
Yeah, for me and for anyone.

299
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:18,955
Why didn't you keep your promise, Miles?

300
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:23,019
Well, I kind of thought it was a high price
to pay for getting dumped, first of all.

301
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,163
Don't.

302
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:29,578
If I'd had bought that club
for you in Beijing,

303
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,167
I never would've seen you again.

304
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:34,987
It was an investment.

305
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:37,779
One investment.

306
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,593
Where are you gonna run
the investment from? Paris?

307
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,834
Sure. Why not?

308
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:49,007
You have companies in places
you've never even been to.

309
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:53,193
By not giving you the money,

310
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,145
I had a chance that you would
come back to me

311
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:58,825
after you got done being angry.

312
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:02,986
And it looks like I calculated
the right way, because here you are.

313
00:29:02,987 --> 00:29:05,996
I get paid for calculating.

314
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:11,185
I hear you don't get paid
as much these days.

315
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:13,928
Is that what you heard?

316
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:15,499
Yeah.

317
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,763
I've made a few bad investments,
that's for sure.

318
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:33,992
And I've moved around some money

319
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,424
to places maybe
where it shouldn't have gone,

320
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:40,395
but everyone's just trying
to feel their way back.

321
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:44,103
People say you're finished.

322
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:46,280
You know, I read, um...

323
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:50,184
an article about you in an online
business magazine.

324
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:55,442
It said you got fucked by the Japanese
when you were betting on the yen.

325
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,510
And you got fucked by the Russians

326
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:02,662
when you bought an obsolete
petro-chemical plant.

327
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:05,734
It also said you've been sucking
their cocks ever since

328
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:09,836
to try and control the damage.

329
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:12,465
You know what they called you?

330
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,264
Perfect cliché of bygone times.

331
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:25,348
You're reading business magazines now?

332
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,687
Sometimes, when I'm going for a laugh.

333
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,103
Made me laugh.

334
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:43,087
If I'd have given you that money,

335
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,149
I never would've seen you again.

336
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,677
I don't need your money.

337
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:52,493
Keep it so you can buy
a petro-chemical plant.

338
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,409
In Russia.

339
00:30:55,844 --> 00:30:58,467
Well, if you don't want the money,
then what do you want?

340
00:30:58,468 --> 00:31:01,604
I don't know.

341
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:05,541
I just came here to see what it was
that obsessed me so much.

342
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:11,107
Well, what did you find?

343
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:15,657
I can't see it. It's gone now.

344
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:23,240
What do you see?

345
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,099
I see, um,

346
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,003
a run-of-the-mill businessman...

347
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,853
alone...

348
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:39,041
divorced...

349
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:43,394
in a lawsuit with his wife...

350
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:46,625
Iosing his grip.

351
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:49,505
Lost in his personal life.

352
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:53,891
Lost in his business life.

353
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,914
His body going to seed.

354
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,475
The perfect cliché of bygone times.

355
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,297
I was bullshitting you, Miles.

356
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:52,862
I had butterflies in my stomach
on my way here...

357
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:56,094
just like when I used to be
in love with you.

358
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:58,919
You never stopped.

359
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:05,693
When I'm away from you,
I'm clear headed.

360
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:10,461
I think about the future.

361
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:15,871
The club in Beijing,
how that could change my life.

362
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:20,679
But when I'm around you,
it all goes blurry and I...

363
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:24,297
I get carried away.

364
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,395
About what?

365
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:49,019
Just memories.

366
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,706
The life we could have shared
and the hopes I had.

367
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,907
For a while, I thought I was
meant to be by your side.

368
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:02,049
How ridiculous.

369
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,131
The truth is it's over now.

370
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,148
It's history.

371
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:19,226
I'm not crying for you,
I'm crying for myself.

372
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:21,498
I'd like a whiskey.

373
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:24,639
All right, then l'll get you one.

374
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:35,482
No, a bigger one.

375
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:39,486
With ice cubes.

376
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:35,281
I don't love you anymore, Miles.

377
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:37,528
I desire you,

378
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:40,403
but don't love you anymore.

379
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:48,945
Since when? Tonight?

380
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:50,512
No.

381
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:54,101
Tonight I just needed to prove it to myself.

382
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:02,650
Well, since when, then?

383
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,263
Since...

384
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:12,751
I went out with those
Japanese clients of yours.

385
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:15,707
Do you remember that?

386
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,724
Yes, I do.

387
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:29,172
Well, we ended up at their hotel.

388
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:36,142
The oldest one, Takeshi,

389
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:39,918
had slipped some GHB in my beer.

390
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,958
When I woke up, they were gone.

391
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:48,013
They left a rolled-up 100-dollar bill

392
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:50,096
on the night table.

393
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,105
After that, I came to see you.

394
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:59,283
You were with that girl Louise Flanagan.

395
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:03,885
You had been doing crystal with her
and ordered some Lebanese,

396
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,924
which is why...

397
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:09,869
I don't touch that shit.

398
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,483
Anyway, you wanted me to tell you
everything that happened in front of her.

399
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:19,276
She kept wanting me to admit

400
00:39:19,277 --> 00:39:21,804
that I'd been raped in my sleep.

401
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:25,612
You were raped...

402
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,280
by all of them.

403
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:33,387
Those fucking animals
took Polaroid’s of you,

404
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:37,099
and they showed them around
in their office,

405
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,128
and I can tell you for sure...

406
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:47,057
It wasn't something I was proud of.

407
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:53,739
Louise wanted me
to tell everything in detail.

408
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,596
Seemed to turn her on.

409
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,045
Nobody forced you to say anything.

410
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,515
You did.

411
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:12,874
You wanted me to turn her on

412
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:16,365
so then you could watch us fuck.

413
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:19,689
That's why you had her
come over in the first place.

414
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,409
I had taken two Ecstasies.

415
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,945
I was rolling,
and I let her go down on me.

416
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,505
And I watched you jerk off.

417
00:40:30,506 --> 00:40:33,480
And then we slept together.

418
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,592
No, we didn't.

419
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:38,249
You're getting it mixed up.

420
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,896
You had an early flight to Moscow.

421
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,000
And then...

422
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:48,775
And then Louise took me home.

423
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:51,432
I didn't know how to get rid of her.

424
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:54,890
And then she kept texting me for a month.

425
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:57,767
Why in the hell
didn't you ever tell me that?

426
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:01,032
Because I don't give a fuck
about Louise Flanagan.

427
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:06,471
I didn't even want to tell
you about this till now.

428
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:09,777
When you came back from Russia,

429
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:12,839
you had forgotten all about it.

430
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,855
But not me.

431
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:17,734
We've done a lot worse than that,

432
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,778
and you know it.

433
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:26,694
I say, we've done a lot worse than that.

434
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:29,355
I think it's better I go now.

435
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,340
Hey!

436
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,613
Come here.

437
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:41,893
- Hey!
- Miles...

438
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:42,981
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:45,256
- Please let me leave.
- Where are you going?

440
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,461
Where do you think you're going?

441
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,190
Miles.

442
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:51,205
- Where do you think you're going?
- Miles, let me go, please.

443
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:53,573
Let me go. I swear to God
it's better this way.

444
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:55,176
Please let me go.

445
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:04,772
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

446
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,532
Let me go, Miles.

447
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,648
Let me go!

448
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:10,692
Hey!

449
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,145
These are mine now.

450
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,142
You gave them back.

451
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:40,644
You want a beer?

452
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:55,138
Don't worry. It's not spiked.

453
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,752
And even if it was,
you'd drink it anyway, right?

454
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,338
Maybe.

455
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,321
No. No maybe. Yes.

456
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:06,219
Say yes.

457
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:09,889
Yes.

458
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,593
Now you know, at the end of the night,

459
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:17,345
I'm gonna handcuff you,

460
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:18,753
and I'm gonna fuck you.

461
00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:22,092
Yes.

462
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,128
Right over there in the cabinet.

463
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,216
You kept the handcuffs.

464
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:30,885
Yeah.

465
00:43:54,688 --> 00:43:59,466
I hate them. They hurt.

466
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,104
That's not what you used to say.

467
00:44:07,424 --> 00:44:09,215
May I ask you a question, Miles?

468
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,526
Of course.

469
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:16,511
Am I the only girl that turns you on?

470
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:18,975
Yes.

471
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:20,894
I'm the only one you can fuck?

472
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:23,262
That's right.

473
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:25,277
But the others.

474
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:28,932
The others don't do anything for me.

475
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:33,374
Since when?

476
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,172
For a while.

477
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:39,164
I gotta get that, okay?

478
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:41,022
This is New York.

479
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,294
The market's closing.

480
00:44:43,295 --> 00:44:45,376
Yeah, hello.

481
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,541
No, no. No, no. No, no.
I was expecting your call.

482
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,421
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

483
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,068
No, look, as long as it stays that way,
we're not gonna sell.

484
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,148
That's absolutely out of the question.

485
00:44:57,149 --> 00:45:02,471
That's right. No, I have
the information right in front of me.

486
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,907
Look, we have to be careful, okay?
That's all I'm saying.

487
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:09,155
They're waiting for a sign,
and we gotta be careful.

488
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:36,736
Vortex.

489
00:46:11,673 --> 00:46:14,083
Hey, couldn't I have a cigarette?

490
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:25,371
<i>Merci.</i>

491
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:28,986
Get down!

492
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,048
Don't you fucking move.

493
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:36,768
Okay? Don't move an inch.

494
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:45,407
I said don't fucking move!

495
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:40,312
Is it done?

496
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,188
Did anyone see you?

497
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:47,883
Were you followed?

498
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:50,228
No.

499
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:57,682
The gun. Give me the gun.

500
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:05,035
Did you wipe your prints?

501
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:07,216
I don't know.

502
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,450
You don't know?

503
00:51:09,451 --> 00:51:12,971
Sandra, you asked me to help you,
and I will help you,

504
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:16,459
but if you don't fucking listen to me,
I can't help you.

505
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,891
Do you understand?

506
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:21,066
I did what I could.

507
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:23,818
In any case, you were caught
by the cameras.

508
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,418
They saw you come, they saw you go.

509
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,657
They'll identify you.

510
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:32,234
This time tomorrow, you'll be
a new person in a different country.

511
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:33,865
No one will know you.

512
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,140
Did you bring a change of clothes?

513
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,090
Yeah.

514
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:41,068
Change. Your dress is torn.

515
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:54,962
I booked you a flight to Hong Kong.

516
00:51:58,346 --> 00:52:00,840
You leave for Madrid, early,
7:15 in the morning.

517
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:03,144
Madrid, Hong Kong, 3:30.

518
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:06,189
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

519
00:52:08,617 --> 00:52:10,312
When you get to Hong Kong,

520
00:52:10,313 --> 00:52:15,341
take a taxi to this address.

521
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:18,567
Go inside the building,
go to the tenth floor.

522
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,647
Look for Mr. Ho.

523
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:22,119
Mr. Ho is my friend.

524
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,679
He knows nothing.

525
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,887
He needs to know nothing.

526
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:28,327
Don't ask him anything.

527
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:29,703
He'll take care of you.

528
00:52:29,704 --> 00:52:32,179
You need to do what I say.

529
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,583
When you get to Hong Kong,
do not use your credit cards, okay?

530
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,406
They'll find you immediately.

531
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:44,806
This is 1,000 U.S. Dollars
in Hong Kong dollars.

532
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:47,366
It's not much. Be careful with it.

533
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:49,678
Give me your credit card.

534
00:52:50,536 --> 00:52:53,392
You use your credit cards,
they trace you.

535
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:00,261
Give me your phone.

536
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:01,861
I don't want you using your phone.

537
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:03,695
It's too dangerous.

538
00:53:05,254 --> 00:53:08,485
My flight takes off from Rossi
four hours before you.

539
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,854
I arrive in Hong Kong before you as well.

540
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,605
Mr. Ho will give you an address
to where I will be.

541
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:14,694
You'll meet me there.

542
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:17,349
- At your place?
- No.

543
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,792
The person that hired us.

544
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,773
When the cops find Miles and it's official,

545
00:53:24,774 --> 00:53:28,068
we get the other half of the money,
cash, in Hong Kong.

546
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,636
It's faster, it's better.

547
00:53:29,637 --> 00:53:32,932
Then he disappears, and so will we.

548
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,915
- Give me the keys to the car.
- What for?

549
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,479
You don't need to know.
Just give the keys.

550
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:41,478
Lisa's waiting for you outside.

551
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:46,153
I don't want you to be alone.
She has your suitcase.

552
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:52,113
Wait, you told her about this?

553
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,151
You did.

554
00:53:59,313 --> 00:54:01,331
Lisa's over there.

555
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,815
Sandra. I know you need me now, okay?

556
00:54:05,816 --> 00:54:08,794
We have to wait 24 hours. 24 hours.

557
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:10,638
L'll manage.

558
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,414
You sure?

559
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,968
You have to trust me. Trust me.

560
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,424
Wish me well.

561
00:54:29,425 --> 00:54:31,094
Come here.

562
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:02,323
Lester said to go to the Vegas.

563
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:04,987
You have to be seen.

564
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,439
He asked me to come to China.

565
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:11,677
Did you say yes?

566
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:13,991
What do I have to lose?

567
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,971
L'll wait with you.

568
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:50,569
Lisa, I'm okay. I want to be alone.

569
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:52,167
Are you sure?

570
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:56,043
Lester said
to stick with you till you leave.

571
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:57,389
You're on his flight?

572
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,182
Yeah, 8:40 from Rossi.

573
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:02,010
L'll drop you off, then get my stuff.

574
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:14,078
See you there.

575
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,900
I trust you. You won't blow me off.

576
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,164
I know no one there.

577
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:21,703
Neither do I.

578
00:57:24,618 --> 00:57:27,991
Could I have some water, please?

579
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:01,519
- Hi.
- Hello, madam.

580
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,345
I need to go to this address.

581
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:04,594
L'll take you.

582
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:06,613
- Okay?
- Okay.

583
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:48,033
Excuse me?
Uh, do you know where this is?

584
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:49,153
This...

585
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:52,069
Oh, over there.

586
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,968
Yeah.

587
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:08,246
Hello. Are you Mr. Ho?

588
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:11,577
I'm Sandra. Lester must've
told you about me.

589
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:13,371
Do you have the paper with my name?

590
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:15,872
You mean this?

591
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:34,074
She's here. Text me the address.

592
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:57,449
You remember, Abacus Import, fifth floor.

593
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,054
Abacus Import.

594
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:32,654
Hi. I'm Sandra.
I'm looking for Lester.

595
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:35,089
- He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

596
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:37,206
- Can I check my bag?
- Right here.

597
01:03:43,803 --> 01:03:46,499
- In here.
- Thanks.

598
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,010
Hey!

599
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:54,471
Open the fucking door!

600
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,900
Lester?

601
01:04:15,004 --> 01:04:18,115
Open this door!

602
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:21,953
She's here.

603
01:06:21,954 --> 01:06:24,420
Ah Wing is dealing with her.

604
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:26,982
I told you to wait for me.

605
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,520
You've bungled up enough.

606
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:31,243
Who said to get rid of the other girl?

607
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:33,229
She wasn't part of the plan.

608
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:35,408
Too risky to let her go.

609
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,906
You do not make decisions.

610
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:40,436
I've warned you. I do.

611
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:43,448
Bring her to me.

612
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:45,828
Now!

613
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:04,715
Lester?

614
01:12:04,716 --> 01:12:06,894
It's Sue.

615
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:08,943
Can I talk to Lester, please?

616
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:12,276
He's not here. He left with his cell.

617
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:13,364
Where are you?

618
01:12:13,365 --> 01:12:15,671
Same as you, Hong Kong.

619
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:17,529
Well, I need to talk to Lester.

620
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:22,302
Lester has business to deal with,
but he's going to meet up with you later.

621
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,384
L'll call later then.

622
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:25,858
You want to come over?

623
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:27,492
Do you want an address?

624
01:12:27,493 --> 01:12:33,171
Do whatever you want.
I don't see that you need options.

625
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:38,461
Wait. It's better if you talk to the taxi driver.

626
01:14:38,462 --> 01:14:42,199
I'm sorry. A person's
gonna tell you the address.

627
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:59,300
Hello?

628
01:14:59,301 --> 01:15:00,773
Yes, I'm here.

629
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:03,656
148 Connaught Road?

630
01:15:03,657 --> 01:15:05,708
What do I do? Where do I go?

631
01:15:08,014 --> 01:15:10,130
I can see you.

632
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:31,718
His furniture sales are just
part of the business.

633
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:33,768
They make them in Canton,
they go through Shenzhen

634
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:36,269
and distribute worldwide.

635
01:15:36,588 --> 01:15:41,841
The only thing is, I have to keep changing
the address of this or you get traced.

636
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:43,731
Seems to be going pretty well.

637
01:15:43,732 --> 01:15:45,301
Not well enough.

638
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:50,084
We're hurting in covering costs.
We have big debts.

639
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:52,642
Where is Lester?

640
01:15:54,143 --> 01:15:57,602
He had more meetings.

641
01:15:57,603 --> 01:16:00,430
Have to join him later.

642
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:10,062
And I also make things clear.

643
01:16:10,063 --> 01:16:12,561
I know all about the two of you.

644
01:16:12,562 --> 01:16:15,220
You're not the first.

645
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:19,325
There were others before you.

646
01:16:20,571 --> 01:16:22,492
And you just put up with it?

647
01:16:22,493 --> 01:16:24,029
He needs me.

648
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,713
I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you.

649
01:16:27,714 --> 01:16:31,404
I know.

650
01:16:33,832 --> 01:16:39,543
Andy? Kindly go over them.

651
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:42,996
You're in love with him.

652
01:16:47,287 --> 01:16:52,027
Do you really want me to talk about it?

653
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:54,626
He does it to humiliate me.

654
01:16:56,033 --> 01:17:00,326
I kind of have a hard time
picturing you as a victim.

655
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:01,896
You're wrong.

656
01:17:05,898 --> 01:17:09,261
So you just let him
go on his business of that.

657
01:17:09,262 --> 01:17:12,176
It's convenient.

658
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:13,426
We needed money.

659
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:16,571
What, to pay the club in Beijing?

660
01:17:16,982 --> 01:17:18,903
Yeah.

661
01:17:18,904 --> 01:17:20,825
To pay for the different men I'm into.

662
01:17:20,826 --> 01:17:23,708
It's a lot of money. I don't have it.

663
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:26,784
In partnership with you, it was possible.

664
01:17:26,785 --> 01:17:31,204
Wait. It was me and Lester. Not you.

665
01:17:31,205 --> 01:17:34,408
Didn't he tell you?

666
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:37,387
I'm the one with all the contacts in Beijing.

667
01:17:37,388 --> 01:17:40,174
My brother-in-law works
for the Olympic Company.

668
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:44,146
Lester's from Hong Kong.
He doesn't know a thing.

669
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:47,193
I grew up there.

670
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:52,155
I just checked the Internet.

671
01:17:52,156 --> 01:17:54,877
Miles is dead, they say in the news.

672
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,383
Did they say anything else?

673
01:17:56,384 --> 01:17:58,850
No.

674
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:01,164
They just announced it.

675
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,026
Did they talk about the circumstances?

676
01:18:06,027 --> 01:18:10,222
They say he was found dead
in his house, and that's all.

677
01:18:10,223 --> 01:18:11,823
That's enough.

678
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:14,610
Lester is having a meeting tomorrow
to get the rest of the money,

679
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:20,027
and the other half has already
been wired from an account in China.

680
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:24,252
Maybe Ah Wing was supposed
to take care of you when you arrive:

681
01:18:24,253 --> 01:18:27,072
Give you your share
and help you disappear.

682
01:18:27,073 --> 01:18:30,018
But I'm behind it.

683
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:31,819
Do you know him?

684
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:36,361
I've never met him.

685
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:38,540
He's Lester's contact.

686
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,327
Well, he definitely tried
to make me disappear.

687
01:18:41,328 --> 01:18:43,412
Meaning?

688
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:47,253
Lisa is dead.

689
01:18:47,254 --> 01:18:49,751
I said Lisa is dead.

690
01:18:49,752 --> 01:18:53,213
They probably killed her
because they thought it was me.

691
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:58,177
She shouldn't have come.

692
01:18:58,178 --> 01:19:02,244
Well, Lester said that

693
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:04,263
it was dangerous
to leave her in Paris and...

694
01:19:04,264 --> 01:19:06,024
Lester's full of shit!

695
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:09,676
I'm out of here.

696
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,246
Where are you going?

697
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,193
You have been identified by now.

698
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:18,015
There is a warrant out for your arrest.

699
01:19:18,743 --> 01:19:20,504
You have no credit card.

700
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,650
You can't use a passport.

701
01:19:22,651 --> 01:19:25,828
You don't know anyone here.

702
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:32,325
Lester can't help you.

703
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:34,923
That's the last time you'll see him.

704
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:45,010
Did you love Miles?

705
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:47,829
No.

706
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:52,929
Yes. I loved him once very much.

707
01:19:53,244 --> 01:19:55,613
But I just turned him on, that's all.

708
01:19:55,614 --> 01:19:57,631
Isn't that the same thing?

709
01:19:57,632 --> 01:20:02,404
That's what guys say
because it suits them.

710
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:05,322
But no, it's not the same thing.
I don't think so.

711
01:20:05,323 --> 01:20:06,376
Now you're free.

712
01:20:06,377 --> 01:20:09,451
Free of what?

713
01:20:09,452 --> 01:20:12,271
I'm not free of anything.
I destroyed my life.

714
01:20:12,272 --> 01:20:13,776
You have money.

715
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:15,154
Oh, fuck the money!

716
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:17,781
You and Lester can keep it.

717
01:20:17,782 --> 01:20:19,670
You earned it.

718
01:20:19,671 --> 01:20:24,257
Leave me the fuck alone. Please?

719
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:32,004
I want to go back to Paris

720
01:20:32,005 --> 01:20:35,945
and hand myself over to the police.

721
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:49,718
It's Lester. Look, he's on the way.
I told him you were here.

722
01:21:49,719 --> 01:21:52,152
You told me he was supposed
to be here already.

723
01:21:52,153 --> 01:21:53,690
Where is Lester?

724
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:55,260
What can I do?

725
01:21:55,261 --> 01:21:56,765
I don't know!
What the fuck can you do?

726
01:21:56,766 --> 01:22:00,545
What are we doing in this stupid place?
I want to get going.

727
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:02,755
Well, he can call me
on Lisa's cell phone.

728
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,775
I have it.

729
01:22:08,106 --> 01:22:10,835
Thank you.

730
01:22:13,168 --> 01:22:14,130
Want a hit?

731
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:15,537
I don't want any!

732
01:22:15,538 --> 01:22:17,338
Okay.

733
01:22:18,997 --> 01:22:22,360
Stay. We'll hide you for a few days.

734
01:22:22,361 --> 01:22:23,866
After that, you'll be on your own.

735
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:25,435
Right now, it's too dangerous.

736
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:28,191
I need a passport. That's all.

737
01:22:28,192 --> 01:22:30,175
We'll find you one.

738
01:22:30,176 --> 01:22:32,390
You need cash too.

739
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,200
I don't want to stay at your place.

740
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:46,740
What the fuck
am I gonna do at your place?

741
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:49,785
Where do you want to go?

742
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:51,191
A hotel.

743
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:55,132
A hotel will ask you for your ID.

744
01:22:57,342 --> 01:22:58,558
Wait for Lester.

745
01:22:58,559 --> 01:23:01,571
If you need a hotel room,
he'll find you a hotel room.

746
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:08,776
What did you put in my drink, bitch?

747
01:25:08,777 --> 01:25:10,709
Nothing.

748
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:19,256
You just got off a plane. You're tired.

749
01:25:24,313 --> 01:25:25,914
What was in my drink?

750
01:25:25,915 --> 01:25:28,644
Nothing, I swear!

751
01:25:30,304 --> 01:25:32,486
I should fucking kill you.

752
01:25:33,283 --> 01:25:37,223
Just sleep for a while.
You'll feel better.

753
01:25:38,985 --> 01:25:43,024
You feel sleepy, right?

754
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,753
You can't even keep your eyes open.

755
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:03,338
You're sleepy.

756
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:05,766
Right?

757
01:26:10,987 --> 01:26:15,027
Don't do anything stupid.

758
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:23,767
Give me...

759
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:27,010
your gun.

760
01:26:34,467 --> 01:26:37,546
You're going to sleep.

761
01:26:45,551 --> 01:26:49,688
How could you even think for a minute
that I'd let you see Lester again?

762
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,926
You're awake. You want a coffee?

763
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:05,888
No, thanks. I'm being careful.

764
01:29:05,889 --> 01:29:07,657
I won't insist.

765
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:09,597
At least sit down.

766
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:17,728
I should've picked you up earlier.

767
01:29:17,729 --> 01:29:22,362
I promised I would,
but things screwed up.

768
01:29:22,363 --> 01:29:24,616
I have a new passport
and some money for you, though.

769
01:29:24,617 --> 01:29:26,556
And a new identity.

770
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:28,897
From who?

771
01:29:31,793 --> 01:29:35,267
You're American with an Italian background.

772
01:29:35,268 --> 01:29:38,292
Your name is Flavia Trabasani.

773
01:29:38,293 --> 01:29:40,480
Where do I go with this?

774
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:42,926
To Shanghai.
You have a six month visa.

775
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:45,660
What exactly do I do in Shanghai?

776
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:49,135
I have an old friend.
I used to work with him now and then.

777
01:29:49,136 --> 01:29:51,484
I don't anymore.

778
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,608
But if you want, he has a job for you.

779
01:29:53,609 --> 01:29:56,859
It's a tough city,
but anything's possible there.

780
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:59,699
It's a good place to start a new life.

781
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:01,525
What's your job?

782
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:04,293
I, uh, get clothes made.

783
01:30:04,294 --> 01:30:09,248
They're pretty cheap, but young people
in the West love them.

784
01:30:09,249 --> 01:30:11,468
You wouldn't know the brand.

785
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:16,134
We sell them bulk to chains
that distribute under their own labels.

786
01:30:16,135 --> 01:30:17,711
Why are you helping me?

787
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,481
It's a favor for a friend.

788
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:22,119
What does your friend want?

789
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:26,891
He wants you to disappear,
at least for a little while.

790
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:30,293
Does that plan suit you?

791
01:30:30,294 --> 01:30:34,131
Suits me fine.

792
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:46,125
Sue told me you don't
want the money owed to you.

793
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:48,989
I don't want to touch it.

794
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,533
This will get you to Shanghai.

795
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:53,561
When you get there,
you'll be taken care of.

796
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:59,383
It's best if you leave as soon as possible.

797
01:30:59,384 --> 01:31:01,764
Your ticket's open.

798
01:31:01,765 --> 01:31:04,858
You can still make the 12:00 flight.

799
01:31:10,743 --> 01:31:14,285
Good luck, and forget we ever met.

800
01:32:32,028 --> 01:32:34,505
I'm heading back. A shipment came in.

801
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:36,693
I need the papers.

802
01:32:36,694 --> 01:32:39,501
On the desk.

803
01:32:48,407 --> 01:32:49,983
Did you speak to Kay?

804
01:32:49,984 --> 01:32:54,337
Sandra is on her way to Shanghai.

805
01:32:55,453 --> 01:32:58,639
I honored my side. She's alive.

806
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,598
Lisa died instead.

807
01:33:06,364 --> 01:33:08,647
Did you get the money?

808
01:33:08,648 --> 01:33:10,867
L'll have it later.

809
01:33:10,868 --> 01:33:13,699
I'm moving to Beijing.

810
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:17,947
L'll buy out your shares of the club.

811
01:33:17,948 --> 01:33:20,525
Give me six months.

812
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:25,476
Will you send for Sandra?

813
01:33:25,477 --> 01:33:27,890
Not right away.

814
01:33:27,891 --> 01:33:29,016
Too dangerous.

815
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:32,340
For her or for you?

816
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,062
She needs to keep a low profile.

817
01:33:36,063 --> 01:33:38,388
Then she can come.

818
01:33:40,956 --> 01:33:42,982
You used her.

819
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:44,655
You betrayed her.

820
01:33:44,656 --> 01:33:46,458
She doesn't love you anymore.

821
01:33:46,459 --> 01:33:48,935
She won't come.

822
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:52,675
And one day she'll seek revenge.

823
01:34:05,379 --> 01:34:08,822
If you step out that door...

824
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:13,012
you'll never see me again.

825
01:34:31,283 --> 01:34:33,052
