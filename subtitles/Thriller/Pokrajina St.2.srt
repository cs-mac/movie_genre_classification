I can confirm that she has submitted

on such an occasion to bring a date, right?

He was an instructor at the University and
he is Yuzuki Kyoko's former teacher.

Then he tripped on the carpet and hit

Not a possibility of an accident,
it was an accident!

116
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,011
If he had hit his head on the display case
there would've been circular drops of blood.

117
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,130
This spray of blood proves
he had been struck.

118

Ah, I see.

The door was chained from the inside.

121
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,540
Nevertheless you concluded that this
was a murder, not an accident.

122
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,569
- That's right.
- Based solely on the drops of blood.

123
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,912
I see you've finally begun
to understand this case.

124
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:20,367
Um, Akagi-san is taking the evidence into
consideration and will conduct a thorough

00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,222
For example, any of you could
be the perpetrators.

126
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,225

You don't know?

129
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:51,329
You mean Komatsu made his way into the

You sound as if these are

134
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,341
Based on the attempts to disguise the
crime the criminal is not very intelligent.

00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,941
This is boring.
I'm going home.

Akagi-san.

137

That's fine.

138
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:12,500
We will continue our investigation
without the aid of ST.

139

There's one person dead.

141
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:23,388
It brings the police down to have an
investigator who claims this is boring.

142
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:28,983
What better way is there for the police
to gain trust except to solve crimes?

143
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:31,581
Is there something better than
arresting the criminal?

144
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:38,000
Akagi-san is right. ST will arrest the
perpetrator and serve justice.

145
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,840
Then what if you can't find the criminal?
Or you determine this was an accident?

00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,382
Chief, hurry up and organize the
facts of the case.

157
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:24,968
Roger.

158
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:28,592
After hearing Yuzuki Kyoko's story

159
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:34,163
at 9 AM, she was visited by a former
classmate and substitute instructor

160
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:38,402
Fukushima Reiko-san, in the green room.

161
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,024
Coming.

162
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,005
Oh hi. Come on in.

163
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,857
<i>[10:04 AM Rehearsal]</i>

164
00:10:56,801 --> 00:11:00,679
<i>After that, around 10AM, she
rehearsed for about two hours.</i>

165
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,206
Shortly after 12PM, Yuzuki
Kyoko-san returned to the green room

166
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,718
<i>From 1PM to 2PM, she was visited
by music producer Ono Shinichiro-san.</i>

167
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:12,574
<i>From 2:30PM to after 3PM,</i>

168
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:18,109
<i>a former schoolmate and current University
employee Karashima-san visited her.</i>

169
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:23,085
After that, Yuzuki Kyoko went outside to
get some fresh air before her concert.

170
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:27,490
She left her key inside the room so
a security guard had to open it for her.

171
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,617
The door was chained closed and inside,
Komatsu Sadao-san was dead.

172
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:37,137
How did the perpetrator enter and
exit the green room?

173
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,590
Why did the perp go out of his way
to kill Komatsu-san in the green room?

174
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,695
And why was Komatsu-san in the
green room to begin with?

175
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:48,798
Midori, was there anything that caught your
attention during Yuzuki Kyoko's testimony?

176
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,846
She was lying.

177
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:55,933
I see. That was a lie.

178
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,290
Why was Komatsu Sadao here?

179
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,413
I don't know.

180
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:05,011
That was a lie. Her voice changed pitch.
Proof that she's hiding something.

181
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:08,927
I see. Who benefits from Komatsu's death?

182
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,613
His family might cash in life insurance

183
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:14,328
but that's no reason
to be in the green room.

184
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,853
So the people who were hurt
by this incident are

185
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,351
Yuzuki Kyoko.

186
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,378
Her concert was canceled. Her
reputation as star violinist was marred.

187
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,258
I get it. So the perpetrator was trying
to damage Yuzuki Kyoko!

188
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:33,848
We have to interrogate these three!

189
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,054
Calm down. Nothing good
comes of panicking.

190
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,659
I don't want ST to be disbanded.

191
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,736
I've decided in my heart.
I want to create a home for you.

192
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:44,783
That's why I must win the approval
of the Director.

193
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:47,473
I don't really want her approval.

194
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,362
See, this is exactly the problem.
ST has to try to gain approval!

195
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,626
Akagi-san, your spiteful tongue!

196
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:03,221
Aoyama-san, the state of your desk!
It's too filthy!

197
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:08,994
Midori-san and Yamabuki-san,
your wardrobes need improvement.

198
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:16,037
Kurosaki-san, you too.
Can't you try to at least utter a greeting?

199
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:24,410
I'm going out to question
some people.

200
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,231
I haven't said anything untrue.

201
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,312
I know you're right.

202
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:47,172
I just want you all to live a bit
more intelligently.

203
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,610
What are you talking about?
I am intelligent.

204
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,972
That's not what I mean.

205
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:58,337
<i>[Ono Music Office]</i>

206
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,831
Following the rehearsal

207
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:04,430
you visited Yuzuki-san in the green room
without a prior appointment, didn't you?

208
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,058
Yes, I'd heard she might be rehearsing in
there so I thought I'd catch her there.

209
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,779
Why did you want to see her?

210
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,906
I wanted to release a CD of her music
and needed to discuss it with her.

211
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:23,184
Of course I also wanted to
hear her play again.

212
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:29,618
<i>[1:06 PM - Ono Shinichiro]</i>

213
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,574
Bravo, bravo!

214
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:36,424
Your playing the Stradivarius is
really the best.

215
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:47,248
Yuzuki-san, I came here
with a contract today.

216
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:50,374
Trust me, I will make
it a huge hit!

217
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:52,557
No thank you.

218
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:56,424
No matter how many times you
come, the answer will always be no.

219
00:14:56,424 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>I had pushed her too far,
I'm afraid I acted disgracefully.</i>

220
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,285
<i>I left without even
saying goodbye.</i>

221
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:09,238
Why did she turn down your offer
to produce her debut CD?

222
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:11,294
Ask her yourself.

223
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,236
I know without asking.

224
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:16,171
It's because you actually have
absolutely no interest in classical music.

225
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,717
Look at this.

226
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,786
Doesn't look like you opened
these books even once.

227
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,719
Do you know the difference between
a violin and a viola?

228
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,652
Huh?

229
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:31,921
You wanted to produce Yuzuki Kyoko's CD
only because she won a prestigious contest.

230
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,956
- Now wait a--
- I don't care.

231
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:40,487
All I want to know is whether her mentor
Professor Komatsu was there with her.

232
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:50,700
Komatsu disapproved of your plan,
so you murdered him.

233
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,002
Wrong!

234
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,123
I did no such thing!

235
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:01,100
I was speaking to Yuzuki-san alone.

236
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:08,748
Anyway Komatsu wasn't the kind of person
who looked after his student's well-being.

237
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:12,744
You all are fooled by his
title of professor.

238
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:20,076
Komatsu-san was pursuing a
physical relationship with Yuzuki-san.

239
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:23,451
If you think I'm lying
do some asking around.

240
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,882
Do you think what Ono-san
said is true?

241
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:32,422
He panicked when we accused him of murder
but he regained his calm quickly.

242
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,483
It's not necessarily just a story.

243
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,706
There are two people left.
Let's go.

244
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,553
<i>[Toto Music University]</i>

245
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,715
Fukushima-san, why were you
in the green room?

246
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:50,292
I was on my way to work and
walked by the room.

247
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,881
<i>I thought I'd pop in to
congratulate her.</i>

248
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,230
Come in.

249
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:59,166
Kyoko-san.

250
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,205
Congratulations.

251
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:03,896
Thank you.

252
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:09,076
Wow. You really have this
whole suite to yourself?

253
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,648
You can practice all you want
on the Stradivarius.

254
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,623
I guess this is the difference between
a substitute instructor

255
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:21,796
and the winner of the Vienna
International Violin Competition.

256
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,861
I'll make some tea.

257
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,701
I'm not staying for tea, after all.

258
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,281
What?

259
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,648
I wouldn't want a violinist like you,
the pride of Japan, to risk getting a burn.

260
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:45,498
Don't forget, trends change quickly.

261
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:51,131
Anything could happen to your
music career at any moment.

262
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,028
Are you saying I held a grudge
against Kyoko-san?

263
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:04,337
Grudge. Jealousy. So resentful
you can't sleep at night.

264
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:05,146
What?

265
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:10,752
You wanted to destroy Yuzuki Kyoko,
so in the green room...

266
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:15,987
you killed her mentor
Komatsu Sadao.

267
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,440
Please don't make such
wild accusations.

268
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,757
How did you get in and out of the
green room?

269
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:25,479
This guy is crazy.

270
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,616
Calm down.

271
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,501
Do the police always try
to put words in peoples' mouths?

272
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,712
Excuse us.

273
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:38,640
Fukushima-san was once the center of
the media as a beautiful violinist.

274
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,021
But the media gets bored quickly.

275
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:48,629
That's why Fukushima-san told Yuzuki-san
to do her best regardless of the media.

276
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:53,904
Sure, there are times one might
feel jealous over another's success.

277
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:57,456
However do you really think that is reason
enough to kill Professor Komatsu?

278
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,367
- I don't.
- Huh?

279
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:03,221
However when you said 'anything could
happen to your music career at any moment'

280
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:06,776
that wasn't just a nasty remark, it
was a warning about something.

281
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,282
And when something did happen,
you were going to smirk

282
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,282
and laugh at Yuzuki Kyoko.

283
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:16,381
What were you planning?

284
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,201
- Stop making accusations.
- There's no hiding your love triangle.

285
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,445
What? Love triangle?

286
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,292
<i>Yuzuki Kyoko and Karashima
are lovers.</i>

287
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:29,408
<i>However, they grew apart, probably
when she went to study abroad.</i>

288
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:34,145
<i>He started seeing
Fukushima Reiko and still is.</i>

289
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:38,296
<i>That much was clear from where you sat
and the way you looked at each other.</i>

290
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:42,637
You wanted to show off
your relationship to Kyoko.

291
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:47,376
Yuzuki Kyoko still has feeling for him.

292
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:52,348
For the moment you're winning in love,
but losing in your career.

293
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,247
A violinist deemed too beautiful who
is now a substitute instructor

294
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:59,006
can't compete with the winner of the
Vienna International Violin Competition.

295
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,948
So you staged a sensational murder
to tarnish Yuzuki Kyoko's career.

296
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,309
No.

297
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:09,983
I'll sue you for slander.

298
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:12,614
We'll find out soon enough.

299
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:14,890
So?

300
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,230
Why were you in the green room?

301
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,695
You were troubled by Komatsu's advances
so you asked for Karashima's help. Right?

302
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,550
- How did you...
- Karashima-san told us.

303
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,900
Did Komatsu-san perhaps come to the
green room, looking for you?

304
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,049
Yes.

305
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:39,380
After Karashima-san left,
Professor Komatsu came.

306
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,592
He forcibly pushed me down.

307
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:44,682
But I didn't kill him.

308
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,639
I was desperate so I just ran away.
That's all.

309
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,013
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

310
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,124
I was scared of being a suspect.

311
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:56,080
When you pushed him away,
did Komatsu-san hit his head?

312
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,480
If so that would legitimately
be self-defense.

313
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,965
No. When he attacked me,
we were in the waiting room.

314
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,267
Not the display room.

315
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:08,131
There was no evidence that
the body had been dragged.

316
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,804
I confirmed through Komatsu-san's emails
that he was stalking Yuzuki Kyoko-san.

317
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:19,216
So to summarize, Yuzuki Kyoko was
being physically harassed

318
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:22,213
Ono Shinichiro had been rejected on
his plan to produce her CD

319
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,263
Fukushima Reiko harbored jealousy

320
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:27,506
and Karashima Akihito was sincerely
trying to help Kyoko.

321
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:31,701
They all had reasonable motives to
murder Komatsu.

322
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:36,933
So the investigation is
back to square one?

323
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,726
We've discovered a few new details
about the people involved.

324
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,371
What are they?

325
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:45,914
Ono, the music producer's office is on the
verge of going bust with a lot of debt.

326
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:50,127
Karashima, on staff at university,
was on bad terms with Komatsu.

327
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,423
Some have even said that he was
bullied by Komatsu.

328
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:56,562
Thank you very much.

329
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:59,423
But...

330
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:04,063
none of these are a
knockout punch.

331
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:13,207
- I'm sorry.
- You're supposed to say thank you.

332
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:21,646
I may not be able to protect ST.

333
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,738
The investigation is going nowhere.

334
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:30,111
Unless something changes,
ST will really be disbanded.

335
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:37,113
Nobody took it seriously when
Midori-san said she was quitting.

336
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,895
- You too, Akagi-san.
- I'm focusing on the case.

337
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:43,171
Don't you care if all the members
of ST get separated?

338
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:46,167
I am focusing on the case.

339
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:53,509
- Let me focus.
- You said it was boring.

340
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:56,658
Is it because you don't want
ST to break up?

341
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,424
Shut up!

342
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:01,397
You do your thing.

343
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,570
And I'll worry about the other stuff.

344
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:08,983
I know someone who can help you
with your worries. I'll call.

345
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,475
Huh? Who is it?

346
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,327
Director Matsudo.

347
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,787
What?

348
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:19,010
I have no doubt she would
answer your questions.

349
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:34,205
Long time no see.

350
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,112
I think we saw each other
just yesterday.

351
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:40,392
I meant I haven't seen you
here in a while.

352
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,585
It's been seven years.

353
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,789
Seven years ago?

354
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:51,309
Matsudo was a detective and Yuki-kun
was a newbie in the crime lab.

355
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,137
They met working on a murder case.

356
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,104
<i>Yuki-kun was outstanding.</i>

357
00:23:56,104 --> 00:24:00,965
<i>Nobody could follow her
analysis and problem-solving.</i>

358
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:04,069
<i>The other officers disregarded her
as a newbie.</i>

359
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:08,574
<i>Director Matsudo alone believed in her</i>

360
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,292
<i>and solved the case.</i>

361
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:16,489
Back in the day when I got stuck on a case,
I would meet you here to ask your opinion.

362
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,770
After the case was closed, Director
Matsudo evaluated Yuki-kun highly.

363
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,133
She recommended her for
numerous posts.

364
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:32,152
But Yuki-kun never once accepted
an offer.

365
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:37,235
To work in the FBI Lab would of course
mean having to get on a plane.

366
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:41,440
Have you gotten your claustrophobia
under control? Can you get on a plane?

367
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,146
I wonder.

368
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:46,365
It has nothing to do with space.

369
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:49,644
Wherever I think is closed space
is where I feel claustrophobic.

370
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:52,060
Why did you want to quit ST?

371
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,988
Do I have to tell you?

372
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,682
You feel bound.

373
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:03,492
You think that ST is now a closed space.

374
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:07,942
But Lieutenant Yurine isn't binding you.

375
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:13,057
He just believes in you and
the other members of ST.

376
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,571
As I did in the past.

377
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:23,958
What? Is that what you came
here to say?

378
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:27,588
You just want to run away
from his belief in you.

379
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:32,368
Do you want me to stay with
ST or quit? Which is it?

380
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:36,087
You won't listen to me either way.

381
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:57,426
You should reconsider whether ST is
really the closed space you think it is.

382
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:13,339
Sorry I'm late.

383
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,277
I've been waiting for you.

384
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:18,670
- Something bitter.
- You just ate something sweet, huh?

385
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:26,573
Director, do you know why Midori-san
suddenly wanted to quit ST?

386
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:28,526
It's because of you.

387
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,024
Is that right?

388
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,965
I knew it.

389
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:40,018
But I still think she belongs in ST.

390
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:42,542
I'm not just talking about Midori-san,
but everyone belongs there.

391
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,607
Chief.

392
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:48,698
Does ST exist only for us?

393
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:57,461
ST is composed of people who were
the best in their field

394
00:26:57,461 --> 00:27:02,164
and was created to support investigations
from a scientific angle.

395
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,200
It was created for investigations.

396
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,985
ST exists to solve crimes.

397
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:17,044
I've failed as the chief of ST.

398
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:23,467
What should I do?
Think. Think!

399
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:30,004
Director, do you regret not being able
to create the right place for Midori-san?

400
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:37,735
I admit I failed to do so.

401
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:41,616
But I have no regrets.
I have no time for regret.

402
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:46,290
That's because you are strong, Director.

403
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,812
I can't do it.

404
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,502
What I can do is...

405
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,412
only one thing.

406
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:02,121
And if there's only one thing
I can do...

407
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:04,616
I just have to do it, right?

408
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,555
Thank you very much.

409
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:17,617
<i>Wherever I think is closed space,
is where I feel claustrophobic.</i>

410
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:21,495
You think that ST now is a closed space.

411
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:25,025
But Lieutenant Yurine isn't binding you.

412
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:29,641
<i>He just believes in you and
the other members of ST.</i>

413
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:35,594
Won't you tell me what you're
really thinking?

414
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,625
How are they doing?

415
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:42,031
I can't keep my eyes off of them.
They're all over the place.

416
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:44,693
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,367
But...

418
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:51,263
I didn't expect Akagi Samon
to say what he did.

419
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:54,591
You mean asking whether ST
existed for them?

420
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:56,295
That surprised me too.

421
00:28:56,295 --> 00:28:58,542
That's why I can't keep my eyes
off of them.

422
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,113
Is it Yurine-kun's influence?

423
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,133
Perhaps it is.

424
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:11,660
But he'd better understand that
self-awareness can lead to a fatal mistake.

425
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,664
Person to person relationships
can be very tricky.

426
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:19,066
Because there's no right answer.

427
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,634
There's something I wanted to check.
Is it okay if I close the door?

428
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:32,364
Yes.

429
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,930
A closed room.

430
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,249
Not even a window.

431
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:04,187
My breath.

432
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:07,253
My breath.

433
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,766
My breath is...

434
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:15,763
not strained.

435
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,276
No way!

436
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:25,890
- Thanks for your cooperation.
- Good evening.

437
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:36,360
What is the chief doing?

438
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:45,697
One. Stay at ST and maximize the power
of this group as I have done.

439
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:50,374
Two. Go work at the FBI Lab and learn the
most cutting-edge techniques in the field.

440
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,091
Was he trying to outline all the
possible outcomes for your situation?

441
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,119
Looks like he came up
with a hundred possibilities.

442
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:06,609
You're right.

443
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:09,815
He must have stayed up all night.

444
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:15,713
That's not what you think!

445
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:16,354
What do you mean?

446
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:18,167
Don't misunderstand.

447
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,778
I'm not trying to hold you back.

448
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,490
I was simply...

449
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:31,692
using these one hundred possibilities
to help you think about your next steps.

450
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,289
Oh, I would like to help all of you
think about your futures.

451
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,554
Chief, you really are stupid.

452
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:43,915
You are stupid.

453
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:45,261
Stupid.

454
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:49,950
You guys are horrible.
Calling me stupid.

455
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,137
Chief, you are really stupid.

456
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:57,541
My next steps don't matter now.
We're in the middle of an investigation.

457
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,133
Midori-san.

458
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,613
Clear up this mountain of memos.

459
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,446
Keep them at my desk.

460
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:09,297
I'll read them after the investigation.

461
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:18,076
I'm going over the case from the
beginning, Chief Stupid.

462
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:18,940
Akagi-san!

463
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,328
Call Kikukawa-san here.
There's something that's bothering me.

464
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:22,520
Roger.

465
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,299
<i>[Stradivarius Yuzuki Kyoko]</i>

466
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:32,798
So this is Yuzuki Kyoko
playing the Stradivarius?

467
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:39,838
The University loaned me this because I
was disappointed the concert was canceled.

468
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:41,440
What is it that's bothering you?

469
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,339
Last night I heard Yuzuki Kyoko
playing the violin.

470
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:50,046
She wasn't treating that violin as if it
were the precious Stradivarius.

471
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:52,056
And what of it?

472
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,817
If this sound is the Stradivarius

473
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,562
then what she was playing last night
was not the Stradivarius.

474
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,625
You can hear the difference?

475
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:06,177
Harmonic overtones produced by different
violins are not precisely the same.

476
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:12,598
In other words, each violin is unique, and
Midori-san is able to hear the difference.

477
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:14,825
Don't you have any other
recordings?

478
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:17,017
I have one more.

479
00:34:17,017 --> 00:34:20,947
It's from the rehearsal on the
morning of the concert.

480
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,470
This isn't the Stradivarius.

481
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,088
She ought to have been using the
same instrument as the concert.

482
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:38,931
Why wasn't she playing the Stradivarius?

483
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:42,224
Stradivarius violins are extremely
expensive, aren't they?

484
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:46,485
In auctions they've gone for tens to
hundreds of thousands of yen.

485
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,537
Hmm, a price that'd make someone
want to steal it.

486
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:50,775
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

487
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:54,290
What if, somebody stole the Stradivarius

488
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,784
and in order to delay the
discovery of the theft

489
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:59,158
they left a substitute violin instead.

490
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:04,043
He's saying that perhaps
Yuzuki Kyoko hasn't noticed the switch.

491
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:07,085
She's a professional! There's no way
she wouldn't notice a different instrument.

492
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:12,497
If that's the case, why is Yuzuki Kyoko
hiding the fact that it was stolen?

493
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:16,340
Maybe Yuzuki Kyoko herself
switched out the violins!

494
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,739
Yuzuki Kyoko would have been
the first to be accused of doing that.

495
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,166
I find it implausible that
she'd be the perpetrator.

496
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,661
Then, who?

497
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:28,323
There must have been someone,
perhaps even very close to her

498
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:31,099
who was trying to frame her.

499
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,748
Yuzuki Kyoko isn't the only one
who has been hiding this.

500
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:38,375
He should have realized at the rehearsal
that she wasn't playing the Stradivarius.

501
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:41,357
- 'He'?
- Who is it?

502
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:43,765
Karashima Akihito.

503
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,338
He has a good ear.

504
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,078
As good as mine.

505
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:55,478
If he had noticed but
remained silent...

506
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:58,486
Karashima seems suspect.

507
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:02,904
I can understand how Yuzuki Kyoko would
remain silent in order to protect him.

508
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:05,914
She's still in love with him.

509
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,637
But where is the real Stradivarius?

510
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:15,020
Contact the University and ask them if they've
noticed anything strange the past few days.

511
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,658
I am going to hear a Stradivarius
in person.

512
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,365
I'll do anything to make that happen.

513
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:23,794
I'll focus on Yuzuki Kyoko.

514
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:30,178
The question is, how is the missing Stradivarius
related to Komatsu-san's murder?

515
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:32,635
Or perhaps they're not related at all.

516
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:35,747
The more important question
is the closed room.

517
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:40,678
How did the perpetrator enter and exit
the room that was chained from within?

518
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:46,062
True. Unless we can solve the closed-room
mystery, we can't prove this was murder.

519
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:52,063
Kikukawa-san, don't scare us like that!
What are you doing still here?

520
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,137
You just left.
How'd you get back in?

521
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:55,868
Don't talk to me
like I'm mosquito larva!

522
00:36:55,868 --> 00:37:00,554
I left the important CD in Akagi's player.
I don't want it to get scratched.

523
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,608
Akagi-san will get mad at you if you
go into his cubicle without him.

524
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:16,838
I see. I see it now.

525
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:23,426
Unfortunately

526
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:27,938
thanks to Kikukawa, the mystery
has been solved.

527
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:37,468
I can't believe I didn't notice it before.

528
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:41,561
That was stupid of me.
Idiot! Idiot!

529
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,838
Stop it! If you've solved the mystery,
tell me!

530
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:52,809
I will tell you more than everything
you need. Follow me.

listen to my playing</i>

my gratitude.</i>

<i>[August 12 1:04 PM
The day of the concert]</i>

540
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,406
- Thank you for coming.
- We were looking forward to it.

541
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:23,293
Where are you going?

542
00:39:24,544 --> 00:39:26,727
The concert hasn't begun yet.

543
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:28,657
Ono-san.

544
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:34,348
It's a very rare chance to hear
a Stradivarius.

545
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:36,928
I have an emergency to attend to.

546
00:39:36,928 --> 00:39:38,529
Excuse me.

547
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:41,781
What is this? Please clear the way.

548
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:45,319
Sorry. I'm not a security guard,
I'm with the police.

549
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,950
Hey, wait a second.
What are you doing?

550
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,847
- What's this?
- That's uh...

551
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:57,550
I bought it for my daughter
to practice on.

552
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,839
If you can't distinguish a violin from a
viola, how did you choose this?

553
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,240
Wait, please, stop that.

554
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,601
No, don't, stop!

555
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:34,740
The Stradivarius!

556
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,767
Take a closer look.

557
00:40:37,272 --> 00:40:38,889
That's a fake.

558
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,735
Couldn't you tell?

559
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,040
Fake?

560
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,751
Since the murder, the Stradivarius has
been switched out with a fake.

561
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:51,903
A very well-made fake that could fool
the general population in sight and sound.

562
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,006
There are two people
who noticed that is was fake.

563
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:57,019
The first is of course, the performer
herself, Yuzuki-san.

564
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:00,220
The other person was Karashima-san.

565
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,270
Your keen sense of hearing
should have caught the difference.

566
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,241
But you kept quiet
to protect the perpetrator.

567
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:10,235
Because the violin thief was none other
than your lover Fukushima Reiko-san.

568
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,741
What you said to me that day...

569
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,521
You killed her mentor
Komatsu Sadao.

570
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:21,967
The muscles around your eyes twitched
creating creases in your skin.

571
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,321
It was an expression of relief.

572
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:29,145
You were relieved because we didn't know
anything about the Stradivarius.

573
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:32,958
You can't cast us as your perpetrators.

574
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:38,436
I found a letter of admission addressed to
the media on your university computer.

575
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:41,950
<i>[Yuzuki Kyoko has the audacity to try to
fool her audience with a fake Stradivarius.]</i>

576
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:46,301
The only person who could have written this
is the person who stole the Stradivarius.

577
00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:52,329
<i>You left your violin case in the waiting
room and went into the display room.</i>

578
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:54,162
<i>You purposely insulted her there.</i>

579
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:56,790
I guess this is the difference between
a substitute instructor and

580
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,802
the winner of the Vienna International
Violin Competition.

581
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:06,700
I'll make some tea.

582
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,838
<i>While Yuzuki Kyoko was out of the room</i>

583
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:14,545
<i>you replaced the Stradivarius with
the fake you had kept in your bag.</i>

584
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:18,482
<i>By leaving your violin case
in the waiting room</i>

585
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:23,872
<i>you avoided suspicion from Yuzuki Kyoko
later when she'd discovered the switch.</i>

586
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,707
Reiko, that was you?

587
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:30,782
You had thought it was
Karashima who replaced the violin.

588
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,281
We found your fingerprints on a
flowerpot in the hall.

589
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:35,439
That's where you were hiding
the room key.

590
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:41,118
You wanted to talk to Karashima alone so
you asked him to meet you there.

591
00:42:41,118 --> 00:42:46,730
You assumed Karashima, who knew of the
hidden key, could have switched violins.

592
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,165
You also assumed that he was the only one
who could have killed Komatsu-san.

593
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:55,594
That's why you also hid the fact that
you'd been attacked by Komatsu-san.

594
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:01,645
You worked so hard to protect Karashima-san
but he had nothing to say in return.

595
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:06,459
You got fed up and took it out
on your violin. Am I wrong?

596
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,408
The violin wasn't the only thing
that had been replaced.

597
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:20,698
Our awareness had also been
switched out.

598
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:26,370
The perpetrator did not kill Komatsu-san
in order to frame Yuzuki Kyoko.

599
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,172
He killed Komatsu-san because
he wanted the Stradivarius.

600
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:35,477
The perpetrator is

601
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,707
you.

602
00:43:40,669 --> 00:43:41,274
You're wrong.

603
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:45,393
You would steal and sell the Stradivarius
and use the money to pay off your loans.

604
00:43:45,393 --> 00:43:46,293
I said you're wrong!

605
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,062
When the body was discovered
there was a chain on the door.

606
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:54,855
Nobody could enter or exit so the murderer
must have been inside the green room.

607
00:43:54,855 --> 00:44:00,287
<i>That day after Yuzuki Kyoko
refused your contract</i>

608
00:44:10,662 --> 00:44:13,702
<i>you pretended to leave while
hiding yourself in the dressing room.</i>

609
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:17,558
<i>You were waiting for your chance
to steal the Stradivarius.</i>

610
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:21,097
<i>But then, Karashima showed up.</i>

611
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:25,624
I got this email from Professor Komatsu
and I don't know what to do.

612
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:30,420
After Karashima left, Komatsu showed up.

613
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:33,907
- Kyoko!
- Stop it!

614
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:38,887
- Kyoko.
- Help! What are you doing?

615
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,225
You thought you were finally alone.

616
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:19,017
Ono-san, what are you...

617
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:28,216
Hey, we both have things we'd
like to hide now, don't we?

618
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:37,620
Let's calm down and have a talk.

619
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:42,972
Let's calm down and talk, okay?

620
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:45,433
Come on.

621
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:55,686
What should I do?

622
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,418
What should I do?

623
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,304
I know.

624
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:05,637
<i>In that sound-proofed display room</i>

625
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:10,142
<i>you killed Komatsu and made it look
like an accident.</i>

626
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,998
<i>You tried to steal the Stradivarius
and escape but...</i>

627
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:17,286
<i>- I'm sorry I left the key inside.
- It's not a problem.</i>

628
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:29,898
Is somebody in here? Open up.

629
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:31,919
Excuse me?

630
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:36,309
- Please wait here.
- All right.

631
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:51,387
<i>And when everyone was focused
on the dead body</i>

632
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:58,936
<i>you saw everyone in the display room and
joined them like you'd come from outside.</i>

633
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:03,700
Only you, who was in the display room with
Yuzuki Kyoko could have done this.

634
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,549
If Yuzuki Kyoko had been in the waiting
room, you couldn't have hidden.

635
00:47:12,569 --> 00:47:15,601
Because the door to the green room
was chained shut

636
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:18,480
it created the illusion that the crime
had been a closed room mystery.

637
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,283
An enclosed space is so only because
you believe it is.

638
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,671
A closed room is so only because
you believe it is.

639
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,246
No, no I didn't do it!

640
00:47:25,246 --> 00:47:28,740
Shut up. Stop repeating yourself
you idiot.

641
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,660
 How else could you have known that Komatsu
was making sexual advances on Yuzuki Kyoko?

642
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,264
The fact that you knew is proof that
you were hiding in the dressing room.

643
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,848
You need more evidence?

644
00:47:38,848 --> 00:47:44,567
We have proof that you were looking for
buyers for the violin on the black market.

645
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:50,733
Stand up.

646
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:53,734
You are wanted for questioning in the case
of the murder of Komatsu Sadao.

647
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:57,888
Fukushima Reiko-san, you are wanted for
questioning in a case of larceny.

648
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:02,952
We will be taking testimonies
from all of you.

649
00:48:07,646 --> 00:48:11,956
We couldn't have solved this case
without you, Midori-san.

650
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:15,753
The person who's saved ST
from being disbanded is

651
00:48:15,753 --> 00:48:17,949
you, Midori-san.

652
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:20,132
Chief, you're just...

653
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:22,238
Never mind.

654
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:25,244
What? Please say what you were going to
say. I won't be able to sleep.

655
00:48:25,244 --> 00:48:28,264
Perfect. Aren't you going to stay up
thinking of everyone's 100 possibilities?

656
00:48:28,264 --> 00:48:30,241
Saving ST and thinking of everyone's
futures are two separate things.

657
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,072
Isn't anyone going to clean up
this violin?

658
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:35,023
Akagi-san?

659
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,453
That's the end of your report.

660
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,959
Good work.

661
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:46,266
Um, about the future of ST...

662
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:55,024
Never mind.
Excuse me.

663
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:05,763
Wait a second.

664
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:13,809
Yurine.

665
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,483
Look at this.

666
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:26,712
Director Matsudo's report on where each
member of ST should be transferred to.

667
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:34,344
She told me to toss it because
she wasn't going to be using it.

668
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:39,546
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

669
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,634
It is amazing.

670
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:58,619
A lot happened but everything
seems to have turned out well.

671
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,337
We were able to avoid
disbandment.

672
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:02,980
Hey have you thought of my
one hundred possibilities?

673
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,314
Not yet. I'm still working on
Aoyama-san's one hundred.

674
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,052
Are you sulking because I haven't gotten
to you? Maybe you're jealous?

675
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:12,807
Who are you talking to?

676
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,012
You don't have to get embarrassed.

677
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,547
- I'm not embarrassed.
- Yes you are.

678
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:17,021
Thank you.

679
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:19,296
- Tell me Aoyama's one hundred options.
- What?

680
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:22,773
- Tell me.
- Why should I tell you?

681
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:26,617
I'll do yours after I get through hers.
You'll just have to wait.

682
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:27,900
