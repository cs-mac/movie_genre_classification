<font color="#F1c822">Yeah, it adds up to 11.</font>

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,200
<font color="#F1c822">Good job.</font>

118
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,000
<font color="#F1c822">Mittens! Mittens!</font>

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
<font color="#F1c822">Excuse me! Excuse me!</font>

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,000
<font color="#F1c822">You didn't see a little
orange tabby, did you?</font>

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">No, I can't say that we did.</font>

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
<font color="#F1c822">Just ignore her.</font>

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">No! No!
I need to find her.</font>

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
<font color="#F1c822">She doesn't leave the porch.</font>

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">She never leaves the yard.</font>

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry. We didn't see it.
We're just moving in.</font>

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">New neighbors?
I don't want new neighbors.</font>

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">Annie.</font>

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
<font color="#F1c822">I miss Professor Hampton.</font>

130
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
<font color="#F1c822">We will let you know
if we see your little cat.</font>

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Now turn around and go home.</font>

132
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sure she's playing in your
garage like she always does.</font>

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
<font color="#F1c822">Like always?</font>

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll stop by when I'm done here.</font>

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
<font color="#F1c822">Go.</font>

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">All right, let's go inside.</font>

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on. Here we go!</font>

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,000
<font color="#F1c822">I am so sorry about that.</font>

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,200
<font color="#F1c822">Ever since she lost her husband,
things have been.. well.</font>

140
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, yeah.</font>

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,200
<font color="#F1c822">You know, she was essentially
raised on campus.</font>

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,000
<font color="#F1c822">Her parents taught there
and her brother, Son of a gun.</font>

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,200
<font color="#F1c822">We're having a little
raccoon trouble lately.</font>

144
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
<font color="#F1c822">Probably her cat.</font>

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

146
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll have someone out
to fix that right away.</font>

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
<font color="#F1c822">These houses are historical, you know.</font>

148
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
<font color="#F1c822">They're nationally registered,</font>

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">five of them on this block alone.</font>

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
<font color="#F1c822">Let me show you the upstairs.</font>

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
<font color="#F1c822">Here we go.</font>

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat, this is gonna be your room.</font>

154
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nice, huh?</font>

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, beautiful boy.</font>

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">I bet all the girls in school,
will take a shine to him..</font>

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">Actually, he's home schooled.</font>

158
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, well. That's good news.</font>

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,200
<font color="#F1c822">We've been going through a lot of budget
cuts lately with the elementary school.</font>

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
<font color="#F1c822">Horrible...
Really horrible.</font>

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">Let's move on. Here we go.</font>

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
<font color="#F1c822">Look at that big back yard.</font>

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,200
<font color="#F1c822">I bet you'll get into
lots of trouble back there.</font>

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
<font color="#F1c822">What do you think?</font>

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,200
<font color="#F1c822">Look at that! It's amazing.</font>

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">Mmm..</font>

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">It's nice.</font>

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">Let me show you the rest of the house.</font>

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Thank you so much,
Janice, for everything.</font>

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, that's what neighbors are for.</font>

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,200
<font color="#F1c822">A pleasure to meet you, Melissa.</font>

174
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nathan. Aw!</font>

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">Can't blame a gal for trying, huh?</font>

176
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">Professor, I'll probably see you
on campus in a couple of days.</font>

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,200
<font color="#F1c822">I just hope I can fill
Professor Hampton's shoes.</font>

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, don't you worry about him.</font>

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
<font color="#F1c822">He was with us forever.</font>

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
<font color="#F1c822">Between you and me,
it was time for him to go.</font>

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
<font color="#F1c822">All right. I'll have the painter here.
First thing tomorrow morning.</font>

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm almost done here.</font>

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
<font color="#F1c822">No hurry.</font>

184
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,000
<font color="#F1c822">Here. These must have been left
here by Professor Hampton.</font>

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
<font color="#F1c822">Did you know him?</font>

186
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">Profesor Hampton?</font>

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sure, I had to clean up
after his going away party.</font>

188
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, big party?</font>

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">I wasn't invited.</font>

190
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh!</font>

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, my goodness.</font>

192
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
<font color="#F1c822">Must be the painter.</font>

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
<font color="#F1c822">We're the welcoming committee.</font>

194
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
<font color="#F1c822">WELCOME.</font>

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">Hi.</font>

196
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm Chris demms.
This is my wife Sarah.</font>

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200
<font color="#F1c822">We live right across the street
in that blue house there.</font>

198
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh. This is Nathan and I'm Melissa.</font>

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">So great to meet you.</font>

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">Here. These are from our garden.</font>

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, how thoughtful.</font>

202
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll have to unpack a vase
and put 'em in some water.</font>

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">I made you some molasses cookies.</font>

204
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
<font color="#F1c822">My grandmother's recipe.</font>

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh!</font>

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
<font color="#F1c822">Fresh from the oven.</font>

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
<font color="#F1c822">Mmm..</font>

208
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">KWould you like one, Nathan?</font>

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,200
<font color="#F1c822">No, he'll have one later. I don't
want him to have sugar this early.</font>

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
<font color="#F1c822">But, thank you.</font>

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,200
<font color="#F1c822">We got you this.</font>

212
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
<font color="#F1c822">It's a pre-birthday gift.</font>

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">It's so nice to have a child
in the neighborhood again.</font>

214
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah. Are you gonna
say thank you?</font>

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
<font color="#F1c822">He's a little shy.</font>

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
<font color="#F1c822">The strong silent type, huh?</font>

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
<font color="#F1c822">How did you know it was
his birthday coming up?</font>

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, Janice told us.</font>

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
<font color="#F1c822">So, where's your husband?</font>

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, he's at the school.</font>

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">He's working on
his first class.</font>

222
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
<font color="#F1c822">Well, we'll let you
get back to unpacking.</font>

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
<font color="#F1c822">No hurry in getting
that plate back.</font>

224
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">Thanks.</font>

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">All right, bye.</font>

226
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">Bye.</font>

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
<font color="#F1c822">Trust me. You
don't want one.</font>

228
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, God.</font>

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, look at that.</font>

230
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,000
<font color="#F1c822">Have you seen a little
yellow tabby cat?</font>

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, boy. He is such a rascal</font>

232
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,000
<font color="#F1c822">Are you 11?</font>

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,200
<font color="#F1c822">Are you turning 11?</font>

234
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
<font color="#F1c822">I am so old.</font>

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">I can't even remember
what it's like to be 11.</font>

236
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,000
<font color="#F1c822">When's your birthday?</font>

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">Is it Friday?</font>

238
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,000
<font color="#F1c822">Goodness. You're going
to be 11 on 11/11/11.</font>

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,200
<font color="#F1c822">That is something, isn't it?</font>

240
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">Do you gamble?</font>

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,200
<font color="#F1c822">Good. You save your money.</font>

242
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
<font color="#F1c822">Do you like trains?</font>

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah. My husband
was crazy about 'em.</font>

244
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
<font color="#F1c822">I have a whole set
down in my garage.</font>

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
<font color="#F1c822">You should see it.</font>

246
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
<font color="#F1c822">There's little trees
and there's Bridges.</font>

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on. Come on.
I'll show you.</font>

248
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
<font color="#F1c822">- Come on.</font>
<font color="#0080ff">- Nat!</font>

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,200
<font color="#F1c822">Hi, Hi. Oh, I'm Annie.
I live next door.</font>

250
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">I was just asking your little son here,
if he'd seen my cat mittens.</font>

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,200
<font color="#F1c822">I mean, she's a rascally one.</font>

252
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
<font color="#F1c822">No, we haven't..</font>

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh. Well. If you should see
a little orange tabby, that's mine.</font>

254
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
<font color="#F1c822">My door's always open.</font>

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">My name's Melissa, by the way.</font>

256
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, I know.</font>

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
<font color="#F1c822">Mittens!</font>

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">Let's go inside.</font>

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Mittens.. Aw, mittens.</font>

260
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">Mittens.</font>

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">Just a minute.</font>

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hei, Amigo. I'm here
to fix the wall.</font>

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
<font color="#F1c822">Is he all right?</font>

266
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
<font color="#F1c822">Somebody call 911.</font>

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">Did anyone see
the car that hit him?</font>

268
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">No. I just heard
a loud crash,</font>

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
<font color="#F1c822">and then saw
him laying here.</font>

270
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">What did he do?
<font color="#0080ff">Go home, Mick.</font>

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
<font color="#F1c822">There's been a hit and run.</font>

272
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
<font color="#F1c822">What did he do?
He screw up?</font>

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">Go home, Mick.</font>

274
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

276
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, honey, are you okay?
Did you see the car accident?</font>

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Mommy, I don't
want a baby brother.</font>

278
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
<font color="#F1c822">What?</font>

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh! no, honey
Mommy's not pregnant.</font>

280
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, God.</font>

281
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">God.</font>

282
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">One minute I hear
the doorbell ring,</font>

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
<font color="#F1c822">and the next minute
I hear this car crash,</font>

284
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">and the guy is laying
dead in the street.</font>

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">It happened so fast.</font>

286
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
<font color="#F1c822">Did anyone else see it happen?</font>

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
<font color="#F1c822">By the time I got there,
the entire neighborhood was there.</font>

288
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
<font color="#F1c822">Did Nat see it?</font>

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,200
<font color="#F1c822">I don't know.</font>

290
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">By the time I got there,</font>

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,200
<font color="#F1c822">He was already up here, and
he was mumbling to himself.</font>

292
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">What?</font>

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">I don't know, Jack.</font>

294
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,000
<font color="#F1c822">This is really bad,
I don't like it.</font>

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,200
<font color="#F1c822">I know. You had a hard day.
You just need to relax, okay?</font>

296
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm gonna go take a bath.</font>

298
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
<font color="#F1c822">That's a good idea.</font>

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

300
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">I picked up some
wasp spray today.</font>

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Take care of that
in the morning.</font>

302
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,000
<font color="#F1c822">You didn't drown in there, did you?</font>

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
<font color="#F1c822">Melissa?</font>

304
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
<font color="#F1c822">Aah!</font>

305
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
<font color="#F1c822">Jesus!</font>

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,000
<font color="#F1c822">Jack! Jack!</font>

307
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, God.</font>

308
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">Pregnant?</font>

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
<font color="#F1c822">About three weeks now.</font>

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">Was your prior pregnancy
a difficult one?</font>

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yes, he was premature.</font>

312
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
<font color="#F1c822">How early?</font>

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">Two months.</font>

314
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
<font color="#F1c822">Yes.</font>

315
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Excuse me, Mr. And Mrs. Vales.</font>

316
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
<font color="#F1c822">Dad, the pedersens are here.</font>

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
<font color="#F1c822">Thanks, honey. Tell them
I'll just be a moment.</font>

318
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">So due to your previous
problems with pregnancy,</font>

319
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">the unexpected
loss of blood,</font>

320
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
<font color="#F1c822">Not to mention the pain that
you've been experiencing,</font>

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">Thee are all signs
of preeclampsia.</font>

322
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">It's a serious condition and
it could lead to miscarriage.</font>

323
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm going to insist on
immediate bed rest.</font>

324
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
<font color="#F1c822">For how long?</font>

325
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,200
<font color="#F1c822">That's hard to say.</font>

326
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
<font color="#F1c822">I need you completely immobilized.</font>

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
<font color="#F1c822">Could be one month,
could be several...</font>

328
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
<font color="#F1c822">Several? But I have
to look after Nat.</font>

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">We've been home schooling Nat.</font>

330
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,000
<font color="#F1c822">Would she still be
able to do that?</font>

331
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">I wouldn't recommend it.</font>

332
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">As little activity and stress as
possible is really the best medicine.</font>

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">Don't worry about it.</font>

334
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">Your insurance covers everything, including
a nurse for you and a nanny for your son.</font>

335
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
<font color="#F1c822">Great. So we'll see you
Thursday at 4:00.</font>

336
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
<font color="#F1c822">Okay. All right. Bye-bye.</font>

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
<font color="#F1c822">What happened?</font>

338
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
<font color="#F1c822">Good God.
What now?</font>

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,200
<font color="#F1c822">Don't look, Nat.</font>

340
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hey.</font>

341
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">You know Chris and Sarah over there?</font>

342
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sure. I met them yesterday.</font>

343
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,200
<font color="#F1c822">Seems they had an
accident in their house.</font>

344
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
<font color="#F1c822">That guy Chris was cleaning the gutters
on the second story of his house.</font>

345
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">He's not really a tall guy, you see.</font>

346
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">And I guess he reached too far.</font>

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,200
<font color="#F1c822">And the next thing, you know?
He toppled off his ladder.</font>

348
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is he okay?</font>

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,200
<font color="#F1c822">Well, he was impaled
to death on the fence.</font>

350
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
<font color="#F1c822">So I'd say no.</font>

351
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, excuse me.</font>

352
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
<font color="#F1c822">Honey.</font>

353
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, 11-11-11.</font>

354
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">What's that?</font>

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">11-11-11.</font>

356
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">That's when it all goes down.</font>

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
<font color="#F1c822">That's when..</font>

358
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">That's when what goes down?</font>

359
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,200
<font color="#F1c822">How much more of this
are we supposed to take?</font>

360
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">Relax, honey.</font>

361
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
<font color="#F1c822">Two people have died, Jack.</font>

362
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,000
<font color="#F1c822">Melissa, don't stress out.
It's not good for the baby.</font>

363
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,200
<font color="#F1c822">I met Chris, all right?
He was a really nice guy.</font>

364
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
<font color="#F1c822">Stop it.</font>

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,200
<font color="#F1c822">Now, you need to get into bed.
You don't want to miscarry, do you?</font>

366
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come here.</font>

367
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
<font color="#F1c822">Let's look at it this way...</font>

368
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,000
<font color="#F1c822">At least now we got all our
bad luck out of the way.</font>

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,200
<font color="#F1c822">I suppose that's supposed
to be good luck, too.</font>

370
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
<font color="#F1c822">You must be Professor vales.</font>

371
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm Kyle othman.</font>

372
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,000
<font color="#F1c822">Professor othman, you're
in the office next door.</font>

373
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm new here, too.</font>

374
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">We're really glad you
could start so soon.</font>

375
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,200
<font color="#F1c822">Do you know what happened
to Professor Hampton?</font>

376
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">Well, they said he retired,
but he was gone so suddenly.</font>

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
<font color="#F1c822">I haven't heard from him since.</font>

378
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,000
<font color="#F1c822">Listen, forget I said anything.</font>

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,200
<font color="#F1c822">You better not be causing trouble.</font>

380
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,000
<font color="#F1c822">No.</font>

381
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sorry if I sounded rude earlier.</font>

382
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">I was worried about mittens.</font>

383
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,200
<font color="#F1c822">So you still haven't seen her?</font>

384
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is Nat home?</font>

385
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah, he's upstairs
taking a nap.</font>

386
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm Annie. I live right there.</font>

387
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah.</font>

388
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">I've had trouble keeping
it up since Neal died.</font>

389
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
<font color="#F1c822">Neal. Neal was..?</font>

390
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,000
<font color="#F1c822">My husband.</font>

391
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
<font color="#F1c822">He took his own life.</font>

392
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry.</font>

393
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">We had our disagreements.</font>

394
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,000
<font color="#F1c822">And the old fool decided to
take things into his own hands.</font>

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,200
<font color="#F1c822">Now I know how he felt.</font>

396
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sometimes you have to take
things in your own hands.</font>

397
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,200
<font color="#F1c822">Better the devil you know,
than the devil you don't know.</font>

398
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">Jesus.</font>

399
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,200
<font color="#F1c822">What the hell do you
think you're doing?</font>

400
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Dr. Bolger prescribed a mild
sedative to keep her anxiety low.</font>

401
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">A sedative?
She's pregnant.</font>

402
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,000
<font color="#F1c822">Be assured the doctor would never prescribe a medication
that could result in an embryocidal outcome.</font>

403
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, is that right?</font>

404
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm calling Dr. Bolger.</font>

405
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,200
<font color="#F1c822">Go right ahead.</font>

406
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
<font color="#F1c822">Dr. Bolger, I don't understand.
Why does she have to be sedated?</font>

407
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">It's only for a week or so.</font>

408
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">Starting next week,
we'll lower the dosage.</font>

409
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,200
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">I understand your concern, but
this is a common procedure.</font>

410
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hello, Nat.</font>

411
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
<font color="#F1c822">You didn't expect
to see me, did you?</font>

412
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,000
<font color="#F1c822">Wanna see something?</font>

413
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">It's simply a precautionary
measure, nothing more.</font>

414
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,000
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">Don't worry.</font>

415
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,200
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">The fetus won't be affected.</font>

416
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

417
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

418
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
{\3c&FFFFFF&}<font face="Times New Roman" size="18" color="#ff0000">Don't worry, Jack.</font>

419
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,200
<font color="#F1c822">All right. Well, if you're sure.
Thank you, doctor.</font>

420
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
<font color="#F1c822">That's something, isn't it?</font>

421
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat!</font>

422
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat, stay in the yard.</font>

423
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat, your dad won't mind
if you come in for a minute.</font>

424
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll show you my
husband's train set.</font>

425
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,200
<font color="#F1c822">You can't avoid
your fate forever.</font>

426
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">So, Rhonda. How long
have you been a nanny?</font>

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">I've been a nanny
for the last six years.</font>

428
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">These are my references.</font>

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">I like to get the kids
outside in the sun.</font>

430
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sometimes we have class out there.</font>

431
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">That's nice.</font>

432
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah.</font>

433
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
<font color="#F1c822">Kids seem to respond better when
they feel like you're one of them.</font>

434
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,000
<font color="#F1c822">It seems to help them
open up more easily.</font>

435
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
<font color="#F1c822">Well, Nat needs that.</font>

436
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">And kids love me.</font>

437
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">They call me fond o' Rhonda.</font>

438
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
<font color="#F1c822">Fond o 'Rhonda.</font>

439
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
<font color="#F1c822">I can see why.</font>

440
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">Yeah.</font>

441
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">Call any time.</font>

442
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,000
<font color="#F1c822">I always keep my phone on.
In case of emergencies.</font>

443
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
<font color="#F1c822">Bye. Will do.</font>

444
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,000
<font color="#F1c822">Bye. Thanks.</font>

445
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">What do you want?</font>

446
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
<font color="#F1c822">That must be the next girl.</font>

447
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm Denise.
Your new nanny.</font>

448
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,000
<font color="#F1c822">So how long have
you been a nanny?</font>

449
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
<font color="#F1c822">On and off for a couple of years.</font>

450
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
<font color="#F1c822">What else have you done?</font>

451
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
<font color="#F1c822">In college, I mastered
in comparative religions,</font>

452
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
<font color="#F1c822">and now I work part
time at a butcher shop.</font>

453
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,200
<font color="#F1c822">What's her problem?</font>

454
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">She's on a new medication.</font>

455
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">We'll be in touch.</font>

456
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">So which girl
did you like best?</font>

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm definitely fond o' Rhonda.</font>

458
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">Good.</font>

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
<font color="#F1c822">Me, too.</font>

460
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
<font color="#F1c822">Get some rest, okay?</font>

461
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

462
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hello?</font>

463
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,200
<font color="#F1c822">Hey, Rhonda, this is Jack vales.</font>

464
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">My wife and I would like to
offer you the nanny position.</font>

465
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry, Mr. Vales.
I'm no longer interested.</font>

466
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,000
<font color="#F1c822">What..</font>

467
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,200
<font color="#F1c822">Hello? Great.</font>

468
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll start tomorrow.</font>

469
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">This is Professor vales.</font>

470
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Did you get my fax?</font>

471
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
<font color="#F1c822">Who is this?</font>

472
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">Numbers are not merely
symbols, Mr. Vales.</font>

473
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
<font color="#F1c822">They hold great power.</font>

474
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,000
<font color="#F1c822">And they have that power
because we give it to them.</font>

475
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,200
<font color="#F1c822">When the numbers align,
his fate is sealed.</font>

476
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
<font color="#F1c822">Who the hell is this?</font>

477
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,200
<font color="#F1c822">Your son must die
before his birthday.</font>

478
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,000
<font color="#F1c822">And if you don't
kill him, I will.</font>

479
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,200
<font color="#F1c822">Milda, it's Jack.</font>

480
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,000
<font color="#F1c822">Put me through to Dr.
Othman's office, will you?</font>

481
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, Jack. Didn't you hear?
Professor othman is on sabbatical.</font>

482
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,000
<font color="#F1c822">What? I thought he just started.</font>

483
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sorry. That's all
they told me.</font>

484
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
<font color="#F1c822">What the hell are they doing?</font>

486
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
<font color="#F1c822">Okay, I think we
should talk to him.</font>

487
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">Let's go.</font>

488
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

489
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,200
<font color="#F1c822">We only have three days left, Mike.
What the hell do you think you're doing?</font>

490
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">He did not.
He had a big mouth.</font>

491
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sarah.</font>

492
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,000
<font color="#F1c822">What, Janice?</font>

493
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">I think I have a right to be furious.
He was my husband.</font>

494
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,000
<font color="#F1c822">Well, he screwed up.</font>

495
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">You weren't there.</font>

496
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,000
<font color="#F1c822">Even if he did, you can't just take
matters into your own hands.</font>

497
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,200
<font color="#F1c822">Brian's right. You
were out of line.</font>

498
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
<font color="#F1c822">We can't afford to make mistakes,
Mike. Not this late in the game.</font>

499
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,200
<font color="#F1c822">Chris meant a lot to me.</font>

500
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,000
<font color="#F1c822">What is she supposed to do now?</font>

501
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
<font color="#F1c822">Right. What, now.
I'm the grieving widow?</font>

502
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
<font color="#F1c822">You messed up.</font>

503
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
<font color="#F1c822">I did what I had to do.</font>

504
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,000
<font color="#F1c822">Go to hell.</font>

505
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
<font color="#F1c822">Don't do that.</font>

506
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,000
<font color="#F1c822">And that should do it.</font>

507
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">Make sure that you reset the alarm before you
go to bed and whenever you leave the house.</font>

508
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sign right here.</font>

509
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
<font color="#F1c822">You're all set?
Have a good day.</font>

510
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">You, too.
Thanks so much.</font>

511
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">Jesus.</font>

512
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
<font color="#F1c822">Scared you?</font>

513
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">Can I help you?</font>

514
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,000
<font color="#F1c822">You're new here.
Thought we could be friends.</font>

515
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,200
<font color="#F1c822">I could use some new friends.
People around here can be mean.</font>

516
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry.</font>

517
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">Finally got around to
filling in those cracks?</font>

518
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,000
<font color="#F1c822">These?</font>

519
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">Yep. This whole town is kind of
cockeyed, if you know what I mean.</font>

520
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,000
<font color="#F1c822">Stuff like this here
happens all the time.</font>

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">Really?</font>

522
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">As they say, you gotta build
the gate before you can open it.</font>

523
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,200
<font color="#F1c822">But you gotta have
the key to unlock it.</font>

524
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is that what they say?</font>

525
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sure. You know, there was a big mass
murder/suicide here, like, a year ago.</font>

526
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is that right?</font>

527
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Uh-huh. Crazy
stuff around here.</font>

528
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">You think 9/11
was an inside job?</font>

529
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,200
<font color="#F1c822">What?</font>

530
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,000
<font color="#F1c822">11. The first plane that hit
the first tower was flight 11.</font>

531
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Okay.</font>

532
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,000
<font color="#F1c822">11 is the first number which
can't be counted on fingers.</font>

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Well, not human fingers.</font>

534
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hey, Mick.</font>

535
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">Don't overstay your welcome.</font>

536
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,000
<font color="#F1c822">Well, I'll stop by. And say
hi again tomorrow, friend.</font>

537
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,200
<font color="#F1c822">Filling it in won't help.
It'll just come back.</font>

538
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,000
<font color="#F1c822">What did I do wrong?</font>

539
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.</font>

540
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm sorry.
I didn't know.</font>

541
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,200
<font color="#F1c822">I didn't know.</font>

542
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">I didn't know.</font>

543
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">Go for it.</font>

544
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh! What the hell?</font>

545
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on, Brian. Let's get you
home. Put some ice on that.</font>

546
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is that all you
want to do?</font>

547
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Dig in the dirt?
Boring.</font>

548
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,000
<font color="#F1c822">I gotta get your
dinner ready.</font>

549
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">Whoa! You gonna eat that?</font>

550
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,000
<font color="#F1c822">You know, sometimes</font>

551
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">when you cut a worm in half,</font>

552
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,000
<font color="#F1c822">you get two live worms.</font>

553
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,200
<font color="#F1c822">And sometimes you
get a dead worm.</font>

554
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, I brought you some lemonade.</font>

555
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
<font color="#F1c822">Tastes funny, but it's really good.</font>

556
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come on!</font>

557
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
<font color="#F1c822">I've got a birthday present for you.</font>

558
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,000
<font color="#F1c822">I know it's two more
days till your birthday.</font>

559
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,200
<font color="#F1c822">But by then the whole
world could be over.</font>

560
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come on. Come on.</font>

561
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on. Come on. Come on..</font>

562
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,000
<font color="#F1c822">It's okay. Come on.</font>

563
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

564
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat!</font>

565
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,200
<font color="#F1c822">Dinner.</font>

566
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'll give you the present tomorrow, Nat.
I promise. You'll see.</font>

567
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,200
<font color="#F1c822">No. Just get away.</font>

568
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,000
<font color="#F1c822">No..</font>

569
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,200
<font color="#F1c822">Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh.</font>

570
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">Shh, Shh.</font>

571
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,200
<font color="#F1c822">Gotcha.</font>

572
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
<font color="#F1c822">Aah! No! No!</font>

573
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

574
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,000
<font color="#F1c822">Is something wrong?</font>

575
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">Do you need something?</font>

576
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat.</font>

577
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat!</font>

578
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,000
<font color="#F1c822">What has gotten
into you lately?</font>

579
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Oh, buddy.</font>

580
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">I'm not mad at you, okay?</font>

581
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,200
<font color="#F1c822">This move has been
hard on all of us.</font>

582
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hold on!</font>

583
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,200
<font color="#F1c822">We'll have a proper birthday for you
tomorrow, but I wanted to give you this.</font>

584
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,000
<font color="#F1c822">Mom and I love you.</font>

585
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,200
<font color="#F1c822">Hold on.
Don't open it yet.</font>

586
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,000
<font color="#F1c822">Hold on.</font>

587
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Good morning, Denise.</font>

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,200
<font color="#F1c822">But I need you to let

672
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,200

take your medicine.</font>

673

677
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,000
<font color="#F1c822">I actually think it went
smoothly. Powerful, even.</font>

678
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,200
<font color="#F1c822">How do you think
Dr. Bolger took it?</font>

679
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">Well?</font>

680
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,200
<font color="#F1c822">You don't think she'll remember?</font>

681
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sofie made sure, she
was heavily sedated.</font>

682
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,200
<font color="#F1c822">She won't remember a thing.</font>

683
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,000
<font color="#F1c822">And Sofie covered our tracks?</font>

684
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,200
<font color="#F1c822">She's no amateur.</font>

685
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">I hope the girl
was actually intact.</font>

686
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,200
<font color="#F1c822">Are you kidding me?</font>

687
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,000
<font color="#F1c822">Mike, her father is a doctor.</font>

688
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">I think he would know.</font>

689
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,000

692
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Normal.</font>

693
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">After tomorrow, none
of this will matter.</font>

694
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat?</font>

695
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">Denise?</font>

696
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,200
<font color="#F1c822">Sofie!</font>

697
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">Nat, what are you
doing in here again?</font>

698
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,200
<font color="#F1c822">I told you to leave mom alone.</font>

699
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,000
<font color="#F1c822">Come on.</font>

700
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,200
<font color="#F1c822">Nat!</font>

701
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,000
<font color="#F1c822">Why does mommy have to die?</font>

702
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,200
<font color="#F1c822">What?</font>

703
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,000
<font color="#F1c822">No! No! No!
Mom's gonna be fine.</font>

704
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,200
<font color="#F1c822">No, daddy.</font>

705
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,000
<font color="#F1c822">Aah!</font>

706
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,000

707
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,200
<font color="#F1c822">What are you doing?</font>

708
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sofie, get in here.</font>

709
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,200
<font color="#F1c822">What the hell are you doing?</font>

710
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,000
<font color="#F1c822">It's a superficial wound, Mr. Vales.</font>

711
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,200
<font color="#F1c822">She's going to be fine.</font>

My wife's been stabbed.</font>

721
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,200
<font color="#F1c822">Put Miranda on.</font>

722
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,000
<font color="#F1c822">They slit her throat.</font>

doctor you called?</font>

726

<font color="#F1c822">Never mind.</font>

727
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">It's okay.</font>

728
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,000
<font color="#F1c822">Sofie, did we stop..
Did we stop this bleeding?</font>

729
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,200
<font color="#F1c822">Your wife will be fine.</font>

730
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,000
<font color="#F1c822">It was a superficial wound.</font>

this to you, huh?</font>

your emergency?</font>

740
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,000

over here right away.</font>

741
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,200
<font color="#F1c822">Our nanny has
attacked my son.</font>

742

<font color="#F1c822">Well, sir. Do you have any proof
that this young lady's responsible?</font>

743
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,200
<font color="#F1c822">Proof? I need proof?</font>

744
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,000
<font color="#F1c822">She was his nanny.
We trusted her.</font>

745
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,000
<font color="#F1c822">Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take
you down to the precinct for questioning.</font>

746
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">Please turn around and place
your hands behind your back.</font>

747
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,000
<font color="#F1c822">Aah! Aah!</font>

748
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,200
<font color="#F1c822">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

749
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,000
<font color="#F1c822">You're making a huge mistake.</font>

750
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,200
<font color="#F1c822">This way, ma'am.</font>

751
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,000
<font color="#F1c822">Settle down.</font>

752
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,200
<font color="#F1c822">Get her out of my house.</font>

753
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,000
<font color="#F1c822">Watch your head.</font>

754
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,200
<font color="#F1c822">You're not from around here.</font>

755
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,000
<font color="#F1c822">I can tell.</font>

756
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,200
<font color="#F1c822">I pretty much know
everybody in this town.</font>

757
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,000
<font color="#F1c822">Where're you from?</font>

758
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,200
<font color="#F1c822">That's okay.</font>

759
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,000
<font color="#F1c822">You don't have
to talk to me.</font>

760
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,200
<font color="#F1c822">I can have a nice conversation all by myself.</font>

761
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,000
<font color="#F1c822">Wouldn't be the first time.</font>

762
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,200
