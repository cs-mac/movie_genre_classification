spilt my drink on me,

79

so I was like, "Excuse me," and
he said it wasn't his fault,

it wasn't my fault."

to buy me a drink,

took a notion to hide in the ditch

was approaching,

It's not why you're bleeding.

I mean, I'm not all
there right now.

598

I mean, my head's been
fucking cut open.

599

the way, but I do.

Go straight ahead, first right.

609

given up by now and gone home.

the signs around.

back to exactly where you started.

You brought us here. I
followed your directions.

No.

Tom spilled a pint,

and he was refusing
to buy another one

661
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:43,261
until the man got real nasty
with your friend back there.

Tom's not like that.

He wouldn't... he bought
everyone a round.

664
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:50,469
We joked about it.

Yeah, I know it's confusing.

is getting worse.
