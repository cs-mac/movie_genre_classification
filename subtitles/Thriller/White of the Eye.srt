01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,220
I was at Socorro Ridge. I told you.

781
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,639
- Changing a tyre, right?
- Yeah, changing a tyre.

782
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,975
And watching the sun go down.

783
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,436
- It was a pretty sunset.
- It sure was.

stop off at Freddy Hoy's?'

01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,327
'It took about 30 minutes
to change the tyre.

rain it gets pretty damn soft.'

What did you say you use this for?

793
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:12,764
I didn't say, but I don't
use that. It's not insulated.

again from the top,

leave out the sunsets.'

PAUL: 'The sunsets...'

797

I'm not saying that he's
not telling the truth,

798
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,319
just that his account of his
movements just don't quite add up.

Of course he's not
telling the truth.

ass off, can't you tell?

about his flat tyre?

Well, let me tell you something.

It ain't easy to ruin a
tyre that cost $110.

804
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,045
I bet he told you a lot of shit
about where he got that flat tyre.

Looking at the fucking
sunset or something.

He's looked at a lot of
goddamn sunsets lately.

Good old boy.

808
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,307

where he got that flat tyre.

me who let the air out of his tyre?

I'm a fucking dumb housewife?

(YELLS) No!

1250
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,934
JOAN: Then why the hell
didn't you tell me?

1251
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:54,811
Tell you?

1252
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:57,897
After you fucked him?

1253
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:59,607
You know what I told myself?

1254
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:02,193
I told myself,
"Fuck the both of them!"

have been your dream, Mike.

(CHUCKLES)

1258
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,578
But you just... you just couldn't
quite out it, could you? Huh?

1259
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,265
You couldn't cut it,
could you, big boy?

1260
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:16,165
Either way...

1261
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:18,626
I got my dream. Yes, sir!

1262
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:21,170
- Keep moving, you son of a bitch!
- I got my dream.

1263
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:23,172
I said... I said...

1264
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,217
(YELLS) I am the one!

1265
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,969
And I was the one.

1266
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,765
Wasn't I? Joanie?

1267
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:35,101
Wasn't I, Joanie?

1268
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,020
Wasn't I, baby?

(SCREAMING)

1270
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,197
(SOBS) Look what you did to him!

1271
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:50,450
God, look what you did to him!

1272
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:53,536
Don't go no closer!
Now he's dangerous.

1273
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:55,788
He's gonna bleed to death.
He's gonna fucking bleed to death.

1274
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,957
(YELLS) So what?

1275
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,505
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1276
01:44:11,788 --> 01:44:13,097
Paul...

1277
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:19,437
You're hurt bad, huh?

1278
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,649
Oh honey, I love you.

1279
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:25,777
I love you too, baby.

1280
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:29,364
You want me to shoot you?

1281
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:33,201
Shoot me?

1282
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:34,994
Do you?

1283
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:38,122
Why do you want to shoot me?

1284
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:41,709
Because you can't change the
channel, man. Future or past.

1285
01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:47,840
No way, you bastard!

1286
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,761
You think I don't know what's
going on in your fucking mind?

1287
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:55,181
Huh? I can see it all...
in Technicolor.

1288
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:01,104
Let me tell you, Mike.

1289
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:04,941
I did something with
my life. You know?

1290
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:08,111
I left my mark.

1291
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:14,784
Oh, fuck!

1292
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:19,872
Run, Joanie!

Hey, listen. Back there in '76.

1298
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:45,958
Nobody knew about those
guys back there in '76.

1299
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:47,919
I sure didn't know.

1300
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:51,923
Thanks.

1301
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:58,971
Now everybody's a shrink, right?

1302
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:01,724
It's like... ten years.

1303
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:07,063
Ten years gone with the wind.
