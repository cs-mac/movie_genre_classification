1
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:48,124
Okay, keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

2
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,126
We all wanna
get home tonight. Okay.

3
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,644
Okay, down the alley and turn right.

4
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,013
Come on. You're clear.

5
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,148
Come on. Keep coming.

6
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,117
That's it. Right there.

7
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,536
This was a horrible crime.

8
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,641
A tragedy for those involved.

9
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:47,944
A terrifying enigma to us
who view the aftermath.

10
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,850
I don't even know how such things happen.

11
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,587
But if we did not have a responsibility

12
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,690
to see justice done, we would look away.

13
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,259
For to comprehend such an act
would be to plunge

14
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:06,029
into the darkest waters of the human heart.

15
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:12,235
Fortunately, our task here is much simpler.

16
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,972
It is as simple and as clear as,

17
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,242
as...

18
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:37,627
It is as simple and as clear

19
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,829
as this glass

20
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,400
of pure water.

21
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,540
In order to prevent another tragedy,

22
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,942
the destruction of yet another life,

23
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:57,313
you need only decide whether the right
man stands accused of the crime.

24
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,917
Now to help you with that decision,

25
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,986
I will show you.

26
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,422
I will show you that the prosecution's case

27
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:09,092
rests almost entirely
on eyewitness identification.

28
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,297
Well, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

29
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,167
Eyewitness identification.

30
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,936
But in the course of this trial,
I will demonstrate something

31
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,639
that the prosecution will not mention.

32
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,175
That eyewitness identification is generally

33
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,477
the most unreliable form of evidence.

34
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,481
And that this particular
identification is totally unreliable.

35
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:38,521
So that when we are done here,

36
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,691
your decision will be perfectly,

37
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,160
perfectly

38
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:47,831
clear.

39
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,704
Bunnies.

40
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,877
Disposable diapers?

41
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,312
Yes.

42
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:05,281
I picked up some orange
juice while I was there.

43
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:08,818
For breakfast, you know. Yeah,
but you went for diapers.

44
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,186
At that hour?

45
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,323
Yes. I needed them
right away.

46
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:14,457
Why?

47
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:16,226
Objection, Your Honor.

48
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,962
If Mr. Chase doesn't know why a
mother would need diapers...

49
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:25,368
Mr. Chase, you are coming to a
relevant point, are you not?

50
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,038
Mrs. Monroe,

51
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,141
don't you usually buy them
before you need them?

52
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,878
Yes, but I ran out.
I could have sworn...

53
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:41,217
I mean, I was sure I saw them
in the hall closet, but I...

54
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,694
But?

55
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,564
I was wrong.

56
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,083
You were wrong

57
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,554
about something as familiar

58
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,490
and recognizable as
a box of your baby's diapers.

59
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,129
But you are absolutely sure
you are not wrong

60
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:29,032
about a man you saw for one moment

61
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,934
through the rain, across the street,

62
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,936
in the poor light at the head of an alley?

63
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,615
Your honor, I object to this
entire line of questioning.

64
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,740
There is no connection

65
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,576
between the witness' inventory of diapers

66
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,045
and her identification of the defendant.

67
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,446
Sustained.

68
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,448
Mr. Chase,
do you wish to rephrase

69
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:48,184
the question regarding the identification?

70
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,489
No, Your Honor.

71
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:57,694
That's all.

72
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,332
The witness may step down.

73
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:06,302
We will adjourn until
tomorrow morning at 9:00 A.M.

74
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:10,306
Members of the jury, do not discuss
this case among yourselves.

75
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,608
Good evening.

76
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,957
Why is the district attorney like a diaper?

77
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,792
Because they're both full of shit.

78
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,963
This is very funny.

79
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:37,333
I'm going to owe my freedom
to disposable diapers.

80
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,501
And to you.

81
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,980
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

82
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,149
Just be sure you leave
the flap on the envelope loose

83
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,385
so it's easy to open, okay.

84
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,154
Yeah, good.

85
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,989
Yeah, I'll meet you a half an hour early

86
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,791
and we'll run through it once more.

87
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:05,261
Yeah, okay.
See you then. Yeah, bye.

88
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,572
I don't know about you.

89
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:19,075
You've asked for two adjournments already.

90
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,014
Morning, Jean.

91
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,518
That good?

92
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,522
We're supposed to hold this kid...

93
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:35,158
I came to look at you.

94
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,193
You used to be a good prosecutor.

95
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:40,196
So now I'm a good defender.
I just switched teams.

96
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,366
Is this about the eyewitness?

97
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,168
We did the ID procedure by the book.

98
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,170
She was sure all the way.
She's still sure.

99
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,771
I thought that meant something.

100
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,607
Yeah, it did mean something.
It was the point to win.

101
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,743
So, you think the jury doubts her?

102
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,945
Sure.
Yeah, me, too.

103
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,747
I can't take any chances.

104
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,615
Come in and watch.

105
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,750
Ben.

106
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,154
She sees the body every time
she tells her story.

107
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:06,789
So do I.

108
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,458
Me, too.

109
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,992
I saw the pictures.

110
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,329
You saw the pictures.

111
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:20,269
Come on, Jean.
You know better than that.

112
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,071
How can you be certain she saw my client,

113
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,806
not somebody who looks a lot like him?

114
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,642
Certain enough to be judge,
jury and executioner?

115
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,312
You're just pissed

116
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,957
because your marbles got knocked out of
the game. We're not playing marbles.

117
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,584
A woman was raped and butchered, remember?

118
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,986
And I'm not even sure which came first.

119
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,087
Ben.

120
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,124
I got a job to do.

121
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:44,927
So do I.

122
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:55,838
The last witness for the defense is Mr.
Hobart Jackson.

123
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:10,286
Please raise your right hand.

124
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,021
Do you swear to tell the truth,

125
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,990
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

126
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,658
so help you God?
I do.

127
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,927
State and spell your name for the record.

128
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,563
Hobart Jackson.
J-A-C-K-S-O-N.

129
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,207
Mr. Jackson,

130
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,477
the crime in question here was committed

131
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,346
on the night of September 12th of last year.

132
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,550
Now, where were you on that day?

133
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,485
In the State Penitentiary at Cradduck.

134
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,520
And why were you there?

135
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,789
I was serving a life sentence for murder.

136
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,792
Your honor, if this man was
incarcerated at the time of the crime,

137
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,127
I don't see the relevancy...

138
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,995
Cut to the point,
Mr. Chase.

139
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,142
You were tried, convicted
and sentenced to life.

140
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,478
Life without possibility of parole.

141
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,379
But you're a free man now?

142
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,849
Yeah. They got the right guy.

143
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,651
This guy.

144
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:17,386
Your honor, this is an outrage.

145
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,322
The eyewitness was wrong about me.

146
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,090
I move that it be stricken.

147
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,659
Mr. Chase,
this is highly irregular.

148
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,040
Well, I got off with a warning.

149
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,942
Congratulations.

150
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,944
I thought you were gonna be in here with me.

151
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,513
It was worth the risk.
Well calculated, obviously.

152
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,349
I'm fascinated by all this.

153
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:48,751
I thought about law school once.

154
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:51,554
A long time ago. It's a good
thing I decided against it.

155
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,256
I couldn't do what you do.

156
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,958
It's more perspiration than inspiration.

157
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:59,795
I couldn't deal with all the
rules, all the technicalities.

158
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,299
But you really do love it, don't you?

159
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,002
Well, it beats lifting heavy objects.

160
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,365
Nice going.

161
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,334
We did it, by God, we did it.

162
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,468
That is, you did it.

163
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,170
It helps to have an intelligent client.

164
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,138
You handled it very well.

165
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,440
You had a strong case.

166
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,975
Well, that's the kind that counts.

167
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,443
Thank you, Mr. Chase.

168
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,944
I'm very grateful.

169
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:23,012
My pleasure.

170
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,380
Thank you, Ben.

171
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,650
Okay.

172
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,885
How does it feel to have
somebody say that to you?

173
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,355
Average. It happens
all the time.

174
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,784
Good morning, Isabel.

175
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,452
Did you behave yourself last night?

176
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:44,854
No, I did not.

177
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,456
I was as drunk as a skunk.

178
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,657
Me, too.

179
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,893
Way to go, kid.

180
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,802
Good morning, Isabel.

181
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,003
Another one.

182
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,700
I don't have anything for you yet.

183
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,237
The case of the bagel bandit.

184
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,540
Alleged bagel bandit, Claudia.

185
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,811
Now this thing is over,
I want to tell you again

186
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,313
how much help you were.

187
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,815
So, now's a good time to hit
you up about a <i>pro bono</i> case?

188
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,184
Shoot.

189
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,986
The defendant's name's Potter.

190
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,556
The charge is assault with a deadly weapon.

191
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:56,091
He has a record, but he says
this was a fair fight.

192
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,460
The other guy claims Potter attacked him.

193
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,262
Go to it.

194
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,933
It may take a fair bit of my time.

195
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,202
And I want full responsibility.

196
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,573
Heh, you want to try the real thing?

197
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:13,776
It'll blow your love life all to hell.

198
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,311
You should know.

199
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:22,551
Full responsibility doesn't
mean I don't want any advice.

200
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:25,454
<i>Crime, according to an independent survey</i>

Mr. Fischer?

229
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,449
Right.

230
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,386
I'm Ben Chase.

231
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,587
Right.

232
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:41,690
You play hard.

233
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:43,525
Right.

234
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,265
I've admired your work for a long time.

235
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,000
I've learned a lot from your cases.

236
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,769
It shows.

237
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,771
I've got too many cases.

238
00:20:55,804 --> 00:21:00,075
Challenging, precedent
setting, important cases.

239
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,112
When you get tired of being
a big frog in a little pond,

240
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:04,747
you give me a call.

241
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,151
Right.

242
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,249
Telephone.

243
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,142
Yup.

244
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:08,844
<i>Ben, I need you.</i>

245
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,146
What do you mean?

246
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,481
<i>I thought about you last week</i>

247
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,783
<i>when the news reports mentioned the diaper.</i>

248
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:18,754
Martin, what do you want?

249
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,322
<i>I want to retain you.</i>

250
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:24,126
<i>I think I'm about to continue
my education in criminal law.</i>

251
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,129
You mean you're under investigation
in that Westfield case?

252
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,498
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

253
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:33,702
<i>Meet me in the park at River Point
at 11:00 at the picnic area.</i>

254
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:36,271
Tonight? Are you nuts? It's pouring.
<i>This can't wait.</i>

255
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,843
Shit.

256
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,319
Shit.

257
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,464
Martin!

258
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:48,303
Martin!

259
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,353
Martin!

260
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,743
Anybody home! Hello! Hello,
please, I have to talk to you.

261
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,311
Who is it?

262
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,280
I have to use your phone.

263
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,815
Please, this, this is an emergency.

264
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:47,949
What emergency?

265
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,818
I just... There's a woman
been murdered!

266
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,187
She's been murdered in the park.

267
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,922
Please. Please... No!

268
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,190
Shut up.

269
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:57,759
I have to use your phone.
Just get the phone.

270
00:27:57,793 --> 00:27:59,961
Just a second. There's one right here.
Dial 911.

271
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,011
Let me do that.

272
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,448
Tell them it's a woman.

273
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,184
She's been murdered.

274
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:23,685
Where?

275
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,554
Where?

276
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,990
In the park.

277
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,692
She's a Caucasian.

278
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,830
In her early 20s.

279
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,601
Very long black hair.
Or dark, anyway.

280
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,471
Janet.

281
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,974
Miss Falkner said the victim
left for the night shift

282
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:49,077
at her usual time.
10:15, 10:20.

283
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,546
She left her car in the usual place.

284
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,648
Now, you pulled up here
about 10:55.

285
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,016
That's about 40 minutes later.

286
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,586
And we need to fill in that time.

287
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,487
Now, what about the man walking his dog?

288
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,390
Running. Running with
his dog. That's all.

289
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,759
Was the man black or white?

290
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,328
White, I think.

291
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,395
You think?

292
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:08,730
It was dark.
Raining, you know.

293
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,498
How the hell should I know.

294
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,033
Was he tall or short?

295
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,371
I... I didn't notice.

296
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,540
Well, he probably lives around here.

297
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,476
What's his dog look like?
I mean, roughly.

298
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,847
I don't know.

299
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,949
Like a German Shepherd,
or more like a poodle?

300
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,118
For Christ's sake!
It was a peeing dog!

301
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,587
I don't know.
Stake out the lamppost!

302
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,323
I've done worse, Chase.

303
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,094
You any better on cars?

304
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,062
Any parked near here when you arrived?

305
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,134
There... there were two
over there.

306
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,136
The VW was there, right? Yeah.

307
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:49,738
What'd the other one look like?

308
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,940
Bigger, darker.

309
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:55,577
That's it? Bigger. Darker.

310
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,246
Well, that's great.

311
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,848
Do you know when they left?

312
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,684
I wasn't looking.

313
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,321
I was thinking about that girl.

314
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:08,957
Yeah.

315
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,426
Let's go over there.
The girl's gone.

316
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,098
Get over here, will you?
We need somebody

317
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,401
who can drive the goddamn thing.

318
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:31,646
Last week, I heard about a
woman murdered in Westfield.

319
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,416
She was also gagged with a diaper.

320
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,151
The report said mutilated.

321
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,453
Was she burned?

322
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:39,621
Why?

323
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,292
This is madness.

324
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,962
But there was some method, maybe.

325
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:49,831
The burning obliterated any
pubic hairs, traces of semen.

326
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:53,201
The autopsy probably won't
even prove she was raped.

327
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,670
Let alone provide identifying evidence.

328
00:30:55,704 --> 00:30:58,273
You're pretty sure she was raped.

329
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,308
Come on, Mesel.

330
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,644
We both know about cases like this.

331
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,347
More or less.

332
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,985
I know why Carl's here,
and I know why I'm here.

333
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,987
He found the body.

334
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,822
I've got one more question for you

335
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,690
you kind of skipped over it before.

336
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,492
What were you doing here?

337
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,498
Taking a walk.

338
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,034
I used to jog here.

339
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,670
I like it.

340
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:31,506
In the rain?
11:00 at night?

341
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,775
And why'd you keep checkin' your watch?

342
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:37,579
I don't know.

343
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:41,182
Doesn't seem to be a whole hell
of a lot you do know, is there?

344
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:42,550
Sonny,

345
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,653
it would please me mightily
to see you sweat for once.

346
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,355
And you will.

347
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,625
You will if you don't start remembering
something useful real quick.

348
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:12,640
Ben.

349
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:15,944
Here. Give me a hand, and we'll
let Peggy get back to work.

350
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,645
He's a hard master.

351
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:19,981
You're telling me.

352
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,686
You're giving these away?

353
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,354
Your collection of quotations?

354
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:27,956
"I hate quotations.

355
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,658
"Tell me what you know."
Emerson.

356
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:33,461
"The power of the quotation"

357
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:35,296
"is as dreadful a weapon as any which"

358
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,832
"the human intellect
can forge."

359
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,334
Chapman.

360
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,202
I don't need weapons anymore.

361
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm disarming.

362
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,474
Besides, some of these books can't
be much good, they quote me.

363
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,243
I quote you all the time.

364
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,179
It's the only immortality.

365
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,485
Remember when I told you
I was going into defense?

366
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,722
You said it was a lot
tougher than prosecution.

367
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,790
Instead of just trying to get the bad guys,

368
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,793
I'd have to defend all sorts of people.

369
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,595
Some with very dirty hands.

370
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,167
I was never afraid of disillusionment.

371
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,438
I enjoyed the game too much.

372
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,909
Sometimes I worried about burning out.

373
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,345
Not about my conscience.

374
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:29,751
I always thought I was so damn smart.

375
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:31,653
You are.

376
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:33,721
I never held it against you.

377
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,860
Now I'm going to do something
that's not so smart.

378
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:44,365
We were meant to act,
even if we make mistakes.

379
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,701
That's why we put a sharp point on a pencil

380
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,237
and why we put an eraser on the other end.

381
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:53,141
This might be indelible.

382
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:59,480
There's no other course of action
that will satisfy your conscience?

383
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:03,218
No.

384
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,889
Then you don't need the advice
of an old man in a library.

385
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:23,504
Who said that?
About the pencil?

386
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,241
I did. Just now.

387
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,510
It'll be in here next edition.

388
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,576
What do you think of her?

389
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,177
It's beautiful.

390
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,749
A bit cramped for me, maybe.

391
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,284
It's like a little island.

392
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,953
Even in the shadow of the
city, a boat is very private.

393
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:13,288
Away from everything.

394
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,458
You should try it.
You can afford it.

395
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,027
It may take several generations

396
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,096
to work up a full appreciation of boats.

397
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,632
I've only got as far as the snazzy car.

398
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,136
You should come out with me sometime.

399
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,805
I'm sorry about last night.

400
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,676
Sorry?

401
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,011
The police gave you a hard time.

402
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,647
You could've just left. You know,
you didn't have to call them.

403
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,983
I think I did.

404
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:44,185
But I didn't tell them why I was there.

405
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,924
Well, they'll come to me anyway.

406
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,994
I need a good lawyer.

407
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,297
Even innocent people need good lawyers.

408
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:58,900
The price has gone up.

409
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,669
The retainer is twice what it was last time.

410
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:07,241
Don't disappoint me, Ben.
This isn't about money.

411
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,079
Take my professional advice, Martin.

412
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,282
You should formalize our relationship.

413
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,873
It's got a few spots on it.

414
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,075
They'll cash it anyway.

415
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:43,678
Wait till you taste the basting sauce.

416
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,246
That's my secret.

417
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,326
What we say here is between
attorney and client.

418
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,962
I can't reveal it.

419
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:02,964
So my recipe is safe.

420
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,599
Anything you tell me.

421
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,803
I need to know why you're taking this case.

422
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:12,006
It's important to me to know
what people really care about.

423
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,942
I think I can win.

424
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,445
So far, I don't see they have a case.

425
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:23,317
Is that all that
matters to you? Winning?

426
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,154
Aren't you interested in justice?

427
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,624
There's no system of law that
guarantees the correct result.

428
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:33,561
My job is to use the system we
have for the benefit of my client.

429
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,797
That's admirable, but rather narrow.

430
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,368
Well, my friend, I am interested in justice.

431
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:43,938
My job is not advocate.

432
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,175
It's avenger.

433
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,148
Anyway, you're right.

434
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:57,485
I have an alibi. They're not
gonna find any evidence.

435
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,220
And no one saw me there.

436
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,525
Not even me.

437
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:07,995
Not even you.

438
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:21,976
Yes, you want the number?

439
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:23,845
It's okay.

440
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,449
Been to Alaska?

441
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:30,885
A couple of times.
I'd like to retire there

442
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:33,688
today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, tough day, boy.

443
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,057
I spent the morning talking to cops.

444
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,959
Especially that one from Sex Offenses.

445
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,494
Boy, she really got me going.

446
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:42,463
You know, I told her not only
everything I know about Janet,

447
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,332
but everything I know about myself.

448
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:47,869
She's good. Yeah, she's good. She is good.

449
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:50,338
I'm here because of something they told me.

450
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:53,040
The guy from Homicide told me, actually.

451
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,510
I thought you were just
some innocent passerby.

452
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:58,246
Some... Some... Some loon who
liked to walk in the rain.

453
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:01,349
And I really thought you were
upset at what you found.

454
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,986
So, I was kind of surprised
to hear you're a lawyer

455
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:08,256
who just tried a case,
a whole lot like this one.

456
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,859
That the number one suspect is a
man you put back on the street.

457
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:18,599
Here's another surprise.

458
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,371
As of an hour ago,
I'm representing him again.

459
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:29,610
Actually, that doesn't surprise me one bit.

460
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:33,881
I thought I was angry

461
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,251
but I'm just sick.

462
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,789
So long, scumsucker!

463
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,629
Let me out of here! No!

464
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,132
Now, listen to me! You listen to me! No!

465
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:54,135
Okay, come over here and
listen to me for one minute!

466
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,236
One minute.

467
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:56,938
For Janet's sake!

468
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,143
Goddamn it!
Give me a chance.

469
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,254
You're sick?

470
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:16,424
I just ate lunch with the son of a
bitch who did that thing last night.

471
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,826
He did it?
Yes, damn it! He did it!

472
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:21,729
He did it last year, last week, last night

473
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:26,133
and he will do it again soon,
if he isn't stopped!

474
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:29,971
I'm representing him again, so I can
find something that'll hang him.

475
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:34,175
Wait a second.

476
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,310
You worked with this guy
all the way through a trial.

477
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:37,912
You went over all the evidence,

478
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:39,480
and you never got a hint he did it?

479
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,982
You were totally clueless?

480
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,851
It is not my job as an attorney
to look into his heart.

481
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:45,987
What about as a human being?

482
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,157
Man.

483
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,331
Why did he get you out there?

484
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,201
I wish to Christ I knew.

485
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,535
And what makes you think

486
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:05,106
you can get something the police can't?

487
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,642
Eventually, he'll say too much.

488
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:10,578
How many lives does "eventually" equal?

489
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:15,182
That's not fair.

490
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:16,817
None of it's fair.

491
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:33,701
Did Janet know Doreen Clark
or Phylis Gilder?

492
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:37,805
Mesel asked me that.

493
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:39,407
They're the others, right?

494
00:42:40,508 --> 00:42:43,010
No, she never mentioned them.

495
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,845
I just moved back to town.

496
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,149
We've been friends since we were kids.

497
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:50,184
While I was away, she
inherited her parents' house

498
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:51,886
and it seemed perfect for the two of us.

499
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,421
So, a couple of months ago...

500
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:57,224
God, was it just last night?

501
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,431
I know.

502
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:08,436
If you think of anything
at all, call me, okay?

503
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:14,108
I'm trying to play!

504
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,276
Stop it.

505
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,812
Get down. Right away, do you hear me?

506
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:23,584
It's also painted, so that it's easy to spot

507
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:25,686
with the words "Police" in big letters.

508
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,622
That's so you can find it fast
when you need it.

509
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:32,693
The same is also true about the men
and women inside the police cars.

510
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:35,229
Don't let their uniforms scare you.

511
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:38,733
They wear a special uniform,
because they do a special job.

512
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,302
But they're ordinary people.

513
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:43,604
There's one thing you must remember:

514
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:44,805
Policemen and women...

515
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:57,785
No!

516
00:43:57,818 --> 00:44:00,454
Why don't you come back in about 10 years?

517
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:19,140
You're talking about an attorney
selling his client down the river.

518
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:20,674
I'm talking hypothetically.

519
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:23,277
He won't be
an attorney long. Maybe.

520
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,179
But he's going ahead anyway.

521
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:27,448
He's got an inside line
that can't be wasted.

522
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:29,950
Hold it.

523
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:32,453
This lawyer is also a potential witness.
He found the body.

524
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,121
He'll be challenged.

525
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:36,123
But his testimony's not essential

526
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:38,759
and his client has a right
to counsel of choice.

527
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:40,127
While that's being sorted out,

528
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:42,363
the lawyer could find something definitive.

529
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:44,965
Slip it to the cops anonymously.

530
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,502
Carl said you get a copy of this.

531
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:50,638
I'll have the set of pictures for you later.

532
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,306
All right. Thanks, Eddie.

533
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:59,647
Your hero's pretty dumb if he tries
to do police work on his own.

534
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:03,517
He could use some help

535
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:09,423
from someone who really wants
the bastard stopped.

536
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:14,562
So, now you're gonna be
judge, jury and executioner?

537
00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:23,003
Well, keep trying.

538
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,073
Okay. What do you got,
not hypothetically?

539
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,845
He called me out there and
instead of him, I found her.

540
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:32,479
That's it.

541
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,616
And the minute I say that,
on the record, I'm out of it.

542
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:40,554
Inviting me, was a test.

543
00:45:40,588 --> 00:45:43,357
And mentioning him means failing.

544
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,426
That would be the game right there.

545
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,394
Games again.

546
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:49,563
Well, he certainly picked
the right guy to play with.

547
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:52,299
It's the only way I can make
something out of this shit.

548
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:56,637
Are you playing or not?

549
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:01,475
Yeah.

550
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:19,426
Dr. Thiel won't be
much longer.

551
00:48:28,756 --> 00:48:30,090
Shit!

552
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,032
Mr. Chase

553
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:41,068
my son doesn't allow anyone in his room,

554
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:42,603
let alone his closet.

555
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:46,940
I'm sorry.

556
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,442
It's such an extraordinary room...

557
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:50,377
Nobody.

558
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:52,880
I haven't been in here since he built it.

559
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:55,382
Martin did this himself?

560
00:48:56,784 --> 00:48:58,218
We'll talk upstairs.

561
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:07,127
This is exactly the kind
of thing I need to know about

562
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:09,296
if I'm going to defend him again.
Defend him?

563
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:10,764
Nothing's happened.

564
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:12,800
The police asked me about
last night, that's all.

565
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,869
No matter what they told you, Mrs.
Thiel, he's in serious trouble,

566
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:18,972
very serious and I can't
help him unless you help me.

567
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,077
Mr. Thiel should've come
to the trial.

568
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,114
He'll have to show support... There's
not going to be another trial.

569
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:30,951
As I have told you, Martin's father
prefers the house on the island

570
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:32,286
and his dogs.

571
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:37,424
His son was on trial for his life.

572
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:44,264
Simon thinks only the Thiels
can judge the Thiels.

573
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:46,100
Or anything else, for that matter.

574
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:51,138
How does Martin get along with him?

575
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:53,173
Better than anyone else.

576
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,609
It can't have been easy.

577
00:49:58,846 --> 00:50:00,747
We fought about which came first:

578
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:03,851
Medical school for me or an
heir to the family name.

579
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:06,320
The wound never healed.

580
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:10,124
Maybe that explains Martin's resistance

581
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:12,126
to marriage or anything near it.

582
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:16,497
He's really Martin Thiel IV, you know.

583
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:20,234
I doubt there'll be a fifth.

584
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:27,207
What about last night?

585
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:30,811
I was in the file room, working late.

586
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:32,980
As you can see, if he'd
come out of the basement,

587
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:34,481
I would've known.

588
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:38,152
Who's this?

589
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:43,190
He's one of the Thiels, the first Martin.

590
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:44,825
We call him "the pirate."

591
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:46,527
He built this house.

592
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,529
The family always had money?

593
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:50,464
He's the one who made them wealthy.

594
00:50:50,497 --> 00:50:52,466
There was some question as to his means,

595
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:53,834
rumors of smuggling and so on.

596
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:03,143
Goodbye, Mr. Chase.

597
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:08,148
I'll be in touch.

598
00:51:08,182 --> 00:51:10,217
I hope that won't be necessary.

599
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:37,043
I've been waiting for you.

600
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,548
Score one for Ben.

601
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:43,316
You were right about my alibi.

602
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:48,321
You should've told me about this.

603
00:56:48,355 --> 00:56:49,756
You did a fine job on your own.

604
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:51,258
So will the cops...
Maybe.

605
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:52,759
Yeah, maybe shit.

606
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,830
They're pros.

607
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:59,032
You're not gonna hide a goddamn
secret passage forever

608
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:01,868
and you can't dispose of a tunnel.

609
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:04,271
This isn't conclusive.

610
00:57:04,304 --> 00:57:06,039
It's just something I found,

611
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:08,675
and played around with for a while.

612
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,045
Yeah, and what else are they gonna find?

613
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,651
Someday you'll know all my secrets.

614
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:20,954
I wonder if we'll still be friends.

615
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:23,450
Well, well, look at that.

616
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:31,625
Chase, is your client being
questioned in the Westfield case?

617
00:58:33,893 --> 00:58:35,762
Mr. Chase, is there
another eyewitness?

618
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:39,132
Mr. Chase, what about Phylis Gilder?
Is there any connection?

619
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:44,638
Well, well, look who's here,
super-shyster.

620
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:46,806
Where's Stillwell?

621
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,308
Well, it's funny you should ask.

622
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,876
Tony, where's Jean?

623
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:51,111
Out somewhere.

624
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,947
Like the man says, "Out."
But don't let me stop you.

625
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,782
You've got to get that crazy murderer out

626
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:57,350
on the street again, free as a bird.

627
00:58:57,384 --> 00:59:00,987
You've got someone to watch.
What more do you want?

628
00:59:01,021 --> 00:59:03,823
What I want for your friend
would amaze and sicken you.

629
00:59:03,857 --> 00:59:04,958
Just prove he did it.

630
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:06,393
I'm gettin' there.

631
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:10,063
Just found what you might
call "a hole in his alibi."

632
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:13,233
Mesel, I warn you. Don't take this
to court yet. You'll lose him.

633
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:14,501
You will lose.

634
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:16,169
Look, I've had it with you.

635
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:18,481
First, you stand over a barbecued
body, and you tell me a story

636
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:20,373
that my sweet old mother wouldn't piss on.

637
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:22,475
And now you're representing
the man I think did it,

638
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:24,577
the same man you defended
before on the same charge.

639
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:26,680
He was defended in a fair
trial, he was acquitted.

640
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:28,982
That case is irrelevant.
Mesel, you have to keep up.

641
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:32,018
Irrelevant, immaterial, inadmissible!

642
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,820
Jesus.

643
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,562
What the fuck happened?

644
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:44,097
Come on. Take it easy.

645
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,066
First, tell me what took you so long?

646
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,277
I had to enumerate every good
deed your ancestors ever did,

647
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:50,537
not to mention every piece
of property the family owns.

648
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,840
What about my reputation? I was a
model prisoner last time around.

649
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:56,743
Last time around was not
an argument in your favor.

650
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:04,451
They're gonna be watching
you closer than ever.

651
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,886
Can't you argue harassment or something?

652
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,456
- I'll do everything possible.
- Just go out to the island

653
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:11,257
stay away from everybody, and sit tight.

654
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,292
For how long?

655
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:13,526
They can afford to wait.

656
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,795
There's no statute of limitations on murder.

657
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:18,231
Somebody doused the place
with gas from a lawn mower.

658
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:19,566
Did a very thorough job.

659
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,634
Took it right down
to the mouth of the tunnel...

660
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:25,572
Look, I don't care if it was a
proficient, painstaking pyromaniac.

661
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,608
Why last night?

662
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,611
And only the two of us knew
how sensitive it was.

663
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,415
You're the one that's got to do it.

664
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:36,783
I got to stay here.

665
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:39,919
Martin,

666
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,991
I didn't burn that pavilion.

667
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:47,026
I know, I did.

668
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:51,331
We really are partners now.

669
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:55,568
What charge...

670
01:00:55,602 --> 01:00:57,303
Mr. Chase, I'd like
to ask your client:

671
01:00:57,337 --> 01:00:59,348
Do you have anything to say
about last night's fire?

672
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,308
My attorney will make
a statement. Ben.

673
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:04,744
I'm glad you're here. The
people have a right to know

674
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:07,914
how police harassment can grow from
a simple case of mistaken identity.

675
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:09,983
How a law-abiding citizen
who happened once to be

676
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:11,618
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

677
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:14,287
must suffer repeated
attacks on his reputation.

678
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,104
Mesel got an anonymous
phone call last night.

679
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:34,307
It seems that firemen were swarming
all over the Thiels' backyard.

680
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,709
Temporarily and legitimately
breaching their privacy.

681
01:01:36,743 --> 01:01:38,812
Don't get ahead of me.

682
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:40,647
The tip was that the fire would reveal

683
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,148
something relevant to the murder.

684
01:01:42,182 --> 01:01:43,550
But the call came in late,

685
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,394
and when Mesel got there,
the firemen were gone.

686
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:47,320
Re-establishing Martin's
right to privacy.

687
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:48,822
Mesel was excited.

688
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:50,499
Maybe he was thinking
exigent circumstances...

689
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:52,592
Maybe he wasn't thinking at all.

690
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:57,330
Drink your milk.

691
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:03,703
Anyway,

692
01:02:03,736 --> 01:02:05,171
Mesel found the tunnel

693
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:07,841
and he went through it
to Martin Thiel's room.

694
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,177
He what?

695
01:02:12,212 --> 01:02:13,413
I know.

696
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,821
Hey, why not?

697
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:23,189
Once he searched their property

698
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:24,924
and found the tunnel without a warrant,

699
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,826
anything in the tunnel could be excluded.

700
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,328
Yeah, that's what Parks tells us.

701
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,729
Parks, hell.

702
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:35,935
You wouldn't have
stepped into this, would you?

703
01:02:37,303 --> 01:02:38,872
I wasn't there.

704
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:43,042
Mesel thinks he was suckered, by you.

705
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:45,178
I wish.

706
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,679
I can't hold him back, Ben.

707
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:48,047
He's going to Parks

708
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:50,125
and he's asking that you get
disqualified from the case

709
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:51,985
because you're a material witness.

710
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:55,955
Well, Parks won't do that on his own hoof.

711
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,224
It'll take a few days at least.

712
01:02:58,258 --> 01:02:59,926
Days?

713
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:02,028
Meanwhile, we're back to square one.

714
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:04,364
Minus one, no, minus two.

715
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:07,967
The alibi's out of it, and now
Mesel's trying to put me out of it.

716
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,169
Hasn't he got anything better to do?

717
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:12,805
Organically grown,

718
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:15,675
no artificial fertilizers,
and no pesticides.

719
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:17,610
No, thanks.

720
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:22,415
This guy, he's developing
a style as he goes.

721
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:23,950
Gagging them with a diaper before,

722
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:26,719
burning them with a blow-torch after...
Blow-torch.

723
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:29,489
It's no more amazing than
raping and killing them.

724
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:32,091
But he works clean, Ben.

725
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,960
He hasn't left us a thing to go on

726
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:36,095
except bodies in the rain,

727
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:38,531
always in the goddamn rain.

728
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:11,364
I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to frighten you.

729
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:14,167
I did call the house first.

730
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,869
How'd you find me?

731
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:18,571
I've got connections.

732
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:23,276
So, you're a photo editor.
Not exactly...

733
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:25,378
What the hell do you care?

734
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:26,913
What do you want?

735
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:30,383
Can I give you a ride?

736
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:34,787
All right,

737
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,856
Mesel's gonna come to you
with questions about me.

738
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:39,492
He already has.
I kept your crazy secret.

739
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:41,527
I'll be damned if I know
why I should help you

740
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:43,296
pussyfoot around that son of a bitch,

741
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,874
when the only thing that makes any
sense is to blow the bastard away!

742
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:47,567
You think this is the way I want it?

743
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,511
This is the way it is and I
can't fucking believe it!

744
01:04:49,535 --> 01:04:51,204
I'm hanging on because sooner or later

745
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:53,139
he'll let me see something! Me and only me!

746
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:55,708
I don't know, some little thing!
And then I'll nail him!

747
01:04:56,576 --> 01:04:58,344
It won't bring her back.

748
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:02,348
Nothing's going to bring her back.

749
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,929
They had that animal locked up,

750
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:21,667
and I let him out to kill again.

751
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:23,269
Every time the phone rings,

752
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:25,438
every time the news comes on,

753
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:29,308
I hold my breath.

754
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:36,983
I'll take you home.

755
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:57,470
How about getting something to eat?

756
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:01,607
Can't leave the dog too long.

757
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:04,544
She's gotten really neurotic
since Janet just walked out

758
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:06,079
and never came back.

759
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,917
We could eat here, with the dog.

760
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,454
With the dog?

761
01:06:15,621 --> 01:06:16,823
Yeah.

762
01:06:16,856 --> 01:06:19,992
Right, I'll cook something.

763
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:22,829
What?

764
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:25,098
Hey, just stand back and watch.

765
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,360
Messy, but necessary.

766
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,631
First you scrub away
the scum, then you purify.

767
01:09:14,267 --> 01:09:17,903
You didn't come out here
to see me scrape paint.

768
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:20,339
I came to see what you really care about.

769
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:23,342
Come on, then.

770
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:28,080
This is Fancy.

771
01:09:28,114 --> 01:09:31,484
She was disqualified for
shows, so now she's my crew.

772
01:09:31,517 --> 01:09:32,652
Looks fine to me.

773
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:34,353
She looks fine to me, too.

774
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:36,822
Standards don't allow enough for character.

775
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:47,266
They're so stupid.

776
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,669
I could lose them in half an hour here.

777
01:09:49,702 --> 01:09:53,806
Slip into these reeds and turn up anywhere.

778
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,142
You just said you love it out here.

779
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:58,644
Don't play lawyers' games with me, Ben.

780
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:00,379
I do love it.

781
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:03,549
I wish I could stay forever,
just drifting, but...

782
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,052
I have things to do.

783
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:07,219
Sure.

784
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,655
Tunnels to dig.

785
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:12,825
Why are you mocking me?

786
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:15,962
Martin, you've done nothing but ridicule me.

787
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:19,165
You say we're partners, but
you never tell me anything.

788
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,801
There's no trust here.

789
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,669
The tunnel...

790
01:10:23,703 --> 01:10:27,306
The tunnel was a legacy of the first
Martin Thiel, the real Martin Thiel.

791
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,241
My God, there was a man!

792
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:32,044
He moved freely, he knew how
to clean out scum, how to...

793
01:10:32,078 --> 01:10:33,179
Purify.

794
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:39,352
You should appreciate this.

795
01:10:39,385 --> 01:10:43,656
He believed in the <i>Lex Talionis,</i>
the law of retaliation.

796
01:10:43,689 --> 01:10:47,593
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth...
A life for a life!

797
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,930
He did it and no lesser law trammeled him.

798
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:55,067
He saw a man whipping a dog,

799
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,903
he seized the whip and used
it on the man, who cried:

800
01:10:57,937 --> 01:11:01,173
"But it's not your dog!"
And my forefather said:

801
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:04,477
"It's God's dog and I'm here to avenge it!"

802
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:10,216
Do you see the beauty in that?
The purity?

803
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:14,854
There you are, you know, that's what I hate.

804
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:16,789
You show me scenery, you tell me history

805
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:19,225
and dog stories, but not about you.

806
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:21,494
I am telling you about me.

807
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:24,830
Avenger.

808
01:11:26,232 --> 01:11:28,467
That's the role I was destined for,

809
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:33,039
that's what makes sense of my coming
into this world of suffering,

810
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:36,409
wh-why my tiny spark
was not snuffed out

811
01:11:36,442 --> 01:11:38,778
before it had a chance to blaze.

812
01:11:41,247 --> 01:11:43,082
I was spared for a reason.

813
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:47,353
Spared?

814
01:12:23,656 --> 01:12:25,658
You know, you're right.

815
01:12:26,492 --> 01:12:28,327
Anything is justified.

816
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,169
O-B-G-Y-N.

817
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,218
Come to my office.

818
01:13:29,555 --> 01:13:31,624
I'll see you in the morning, Ann.

819
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,765
I knew you were an obstetrician.

820
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,036
It never occurred to me it was relevant.

821
01:13:46,939 --> 01:13:48,641
You do abortions.

822
01:13:51,977 --> 01:13:54,914
My practice is family
planning, birth control,

823
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:57,917
sterilization and pregnancy termination.

824
01:13:59,585 --> 01:14:01,220
Do you discuss your work with Martin?

825
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:05,524
No, and I won't discuss it with you, either.
Why are you here?

826
01:14:05,558 --> 01:14:09,795
Last time we talked, you insisted Martin
was home the night of the murder.

827
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,463
Now we know he could have been out.

828
01:14:11,497 --> 01:14:13,199
He says that can't be held against him.

829
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:17,069
That's a technicality.
I'm talking about the truth.

830
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:28,514
Martin knows about your work, of course?

831
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,151
Of course.

832
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:33,886
And he also knows that you wanted

833
01:14:33,919 --> 01:14:37,289
to terminate your own pregnancy.

834
01:14:37,323 --> 01:14:39,558
You wanted to terminate Martin.
He didn't tell you that.

835
01:14:39,592 --> 01:14:41,794
You should have told me. I
told you what was relevant.

836
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,296
You want brutal frankness,
Mr. Chase, go to Simon.

837
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,333
He was the one who told him the whole
story, his version of the story

838
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:49,735
when Martin was 14.

839
01:14:49,768 --> 01:14:51,837
He wanted to tear him away from me.

840
01:14:53,372 --> 01:14:55,474
It didn't matter.

841
01:14:55,507 --> 01:14:59,511
He was already lost to me,
had been since he was eight.

842
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:07,786
You and I are the only ones close to Martin.

843
01:15:09,822 --> 01:15:11,991
He wants to tell me this himself,

844
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:14,493
but he can't.

845
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:23,135
I had an emergency case.

846
01:15:25,838 --> 01:15:27,339
It was in this room.

847
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,676
The woman had left it too late

848
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:32,411
and then tried to do it herself.

849
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:36,048
She was in bad shape.

850
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,152
My nurse and I were working desperately

851
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:42,855
trying to save her and we forgot the door.

852
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:46,358
The open door.

853
01:15:49,194 --> 01:15:51,497
I turned to put the fetus...

854
01:15:52,998 --> 01:15:55,034
It was dead before she got here.

855
01:15:57,236 --> 01:16:01,340
I had it in my hands to put
it in the tray, and I saw...

856
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:09,348
I saw Martin standing there watching.

857
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:14,353
I shall never forget his eyes.

858
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:18,357
I tried to explain.

859
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:24,663
But I couldn't get him to talk about it.

860
01:16:24,697 --> 01:16:28,534
The therapist couldn't either. Except
once when she got him upset somehow

861
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:30,936
and he told her that his mother...

862
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:40,279
He said that his mother killed babies.

863
01:16:46,585 --> 01:16:47,886
Yeah, come on.

864
01:16:50,923 --> 01:16:55,127
Peanut oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger.

865
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,762
Now, you're cooking.
I have garlic.

866
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:58,130
You know I have garlic.

867
01:16:58,163 --> 01:16:59,798
You always need more garlic.

868
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,068
Come on, boy.

869
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:08,741
First, I'm gonna bestow a gem of wisdom.

870
01:17:08,774 --> 01:17:11,243
And then I'm gonna ask
for a piece of information.

871
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,978
Fair enough?

872
01:17:15,514 --> 01:17:17,983
Life is weird.

873
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:21,620
You know, never underestimate
how weird life is.

874
01:17:21,653 --> 01:17:23,756
Yesterday I almost killed Martin.

875
01:17:24,823 --> 01:17:27,726
It seemed like the only solution.

876
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,095
Today I've got him neat and tidy,

877
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:33,632
if Janet had an abortion.

878
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:37,136
Yeah, yeah, while I was in California.

879
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:39,004
Her boyfriend, Hal something.

880
01:17:39,037 --> 01:17:41,607
I never met the guy.
He was living here.

881
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,109
Janet got pregnant and she wanted a baby.

882
01:17:44,143 --> 01:17:46,512
Hal didn't. They fought over it.
Broke up over it.

883
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:48,714
What's that got to do with all this?

884
01:17:50,015 --> 01:17:52,351
I'll tell you when it's a done thing, okay?

885
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:55,954
But you were right.

886
01:17:55,988 --> 01:17:57,222
What?

887
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:00,058
Everything is personal.

888
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:06,732
Now, what about you?

889
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:12,671
How come you're alone?

890
01:18:12,704 --> 01:18:15,307
Well, maybe I never met the right guy.
Met the right guy.

891
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:48,073
We gotta talk. Now.

892
01:18:57,082 --> 01:18:59,651
This has got to be the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

893
01:18:59,685 --> 01:19:01,153
And "this" is?

894
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:04,656
The motion to seal
Dr. Thiel's medical files.

895
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:07,492
I wish you'd have let me see
it before it went through.

896
01:19:07,526 --> 01:19:09,161
Gary, don't you read the journals?

897
01:19:09,194 --> 01:19:11,773
That motion gives us a piece of one
of the legal issues of our day.

898
01:19:11,797 --> 01:19:12,998
The battle of police...

899
01:19:13,031 --> 01:19:15,000
It's a battle we shouldn't even be fighting!

900
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,268
If you hadn't made the motion,

901
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:18,437
they might not have thought to ask for it.

902
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:22,374
But now the prosecutor's not only going to
ask for it, he'll want to examine them.

903
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:23,942
He already has.

904
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:26,645
It's Parks.

905
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:30,382
Heh, he took his offer
of proof to Judge Ailman,

906
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:33,752
who was a prosecutor for a mere 30 years.

907
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:35,854
He'd love to give Parks the stuff.

908
01:19:35,888 --> 01:19:37,456
If he can justify.

909
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,125
Well, there you are.

910
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:43,862
Where?

911
01:19:43,896 --> 01:19:45,430
Come on, Ben.

912
01:19:45,464 --> 01:19:48,300
Ailman will examine the
files himself, <i>in camera.</i>

913
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:49,568
So?

914
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:50,936
So, if the names are in there,

915
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:53,138
he'll spill those files all
over the courthouse steps.

916
01:19:53,171 --> 01:19:54,306
So?

917
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:55,641
For Christ's sakes.

918
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:57,776
If the prosecution can
show the personal files

919
01:19:57,809 --> 01:19:59,478
of otherwise unrelated victims

920
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:02,281
were in your client's mother's
office, in his own house,

921
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:04,750
he won't see daylight until Judgment Day.

922
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:08,587
And justice will be done.

923
01:20:10,656 --> 01:20:11,957
He's guilty.

924
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:28,106
The nightmare of all defense
attorneys caught up with me.

925
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,642
I did everything I knew
to spring a guilty man,

926
01:20:31,677 --> 01:20:33,145
and he did it again.

927
01:20:33,178 --> 01:20:34,313
What do you mean "guilty?"

928
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:36,081
I mean he did it.

929
01:20:36,114 --> 01:20:38,116
Most of our clients did it.

930
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,085
That's how most defendants
become defendants.

931
01:20:40,118 --> 01:20:42,254
They did it and a lot of
people know they did it.

932
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:45,157
But making sure it's proved they did
it, establishing why they did it

933
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,026
and getting a reasonable penalty,
that's work for attorneys.

934
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,897
Guilty is for juries.
And justice is for God.

935
01:20:57,903 --> 01:21:01,139
You have to do the best for your client.

936
01:21:01,173 --> 01:21:03,308
If your sense of his guilt
prevents you from that,

937
01:21:03,342 --> 01:21:05,944
then you withdraw from the case.

938
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:07,913
There's no other course.

939
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:12,918
I had to retrieve my error.

940
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:25,297
Parks.
What about the names?

941
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,399
Nothing at all. Not one.

942
01:21:33,171 --> 01:21:35,807
Ailman examined the files <i>in
camera</i> and found nothing.

943
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,709
He threw my motion for access out of court.

944
01:21:37,743 --> 01:21:39,211
He threw me out of court.

945
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:40,912
None of the names?
I'm sorry, Carl.

946
01:21:40,946 --> 01:21:42,981
I really thought I had
something for you this time.

947
01:21:43,015 --> 01:21:45,217
But damned if I know why Chase
wanted that stuff sealed.

948
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,052
It doesn't make sense.

949
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:49,588
I told you what to do about him.

950
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:51,923
Yeah. It's already
in the works.

951
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,483
I'm not a signatory.
Yes, yes.

952
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:27,352
I have no stake in the lengthy...
Yes, but what do you think?

953
01:23:27,385 --> 01:23:29,754
I just say, pick up the option.

954
01:23:29,788 --> 01:23:31,857
Stu? Done.

955
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,860
And done.
Just sign here, Ben.

956
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:38,430
And this whole thing will be
behind us, until next time.

957
01:23:38,463 --> 01:23:40,499
Well, let's get back to it, Joan.

958
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:46,538
Carol, will you call Mrs. Corbet and
tell her I can't make it tomorrow.

959
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:50,041
And, Mr. Burgess called about the
preliminary hearing tomorrow.

960
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:51,576
It's at 4:00.

961
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:55,247
Call back to confirm.

962
01:23:57,749 --> 01:24:00,352
Quiet, it's just the mailman.
Hi.

963
01:24:00,385 --> 01:24:02,053
Here you go, ma'am.

964
01:24:03,855 --> 01:24:05,223
Come on.

965
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:30,849
Hal!

966
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:34,085
Hal!

967
01:24:50,368 --> 01:24:51,736
Yeah?

968
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:55,207
I'm Ellen Falkner.
I was Janet's friend.

969
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,209
So, how'd you know I was here?

970
01:24:57,242 --> 01:24:59,911
Your new girlfriend told me
at the apartment.

971
01:25:00,979 --> 01:25:02,614
So?

972
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:04,349
I wanna know about the abortion.

973
01:25:04,382 --> 01:25:06,952
Janet said you had some kind of a...
Fuck you.

974
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:09,754
Yeah, okay. Fine.
I'll ask your girlfriend.

975
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:17,395
So, the woman whose apartment I
subletted recommended her clinic.

976
01:25:17,429 --> 01:25:19,264
But I'm not sure this is the right one.

977
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:21,733
Could you check and see if
a Janet Wallen comes here?

978
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:23,468
I'm sorry, you'll have to ask her.

979
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,804
We don't give out information
about our clients.

980
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:29,841
Of course, I understand. But you can
tell me about the doctors, right?

981
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:46,391
This is a list of all our doctors,

982
01:25:46,424 --> 01:25:48,693
with their credentials and affiliations.

983
01:25:49,828 --> 01:25:51,830
Mrs. Baker? Room Three.

984
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:58,470
This Dr. Thiel. I've heard of her.
She's very good?

985
01:25:58,503 --> 01:26:01,806
There's no guarantee of seeing a
specific doctor. They're all good.

986
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,075
My last question, how late are you open?

987
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:05,744
Normally till 5:30.

988
01:26:05,777 --> 01:26:07,345
We're running a little late today.

989
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:09,614
Great. Thanks. I'll be back.

990
01:26:13,852 --> 01:26:16,321
<i>Hello, this is the recorded
voice of Ben Chase.</i>

991
01:26:16,354 --> 01:26:18,823
<i>Please leave your name and
number when you hear the beep.</i>

992
01:26:20,525 --> 01:26:23,194
Ben, this is Ellen. I think
I found the right files.

993
01:26:23,228 --> 01:26:27,299
The Women's Medical Clinic,
corner of Pine and Pearl.

994
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:30,201
<i>And I think I have a chance to make sure.</i>

995
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:33,838
<i>It's almost 5:30.
I'll call you back.</i>

996
01:27:28,093 --> 01:27:29,728
<i>Hi, Ben. It's me.</i>

997
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:31,038
<i>I've been trying to get you
all week at your office,</i>

998
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:32,302
<i>but your secretary's too smart.</i>

999
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:55,120
<i>The Women's Medical Clinic,</i>

1000
01:27:55,153 --> 01:27:59,090
<i>corner of Pine and Pearl.
And I think...</i>

1001
01:28:09,934 --> 01:28:11,136
Ellen?

1002
01:28:11,169 --> 01:28:13,304
<i>It's Sybil Thiel.
I called you earlier.</i>

1003
01:28:13,338 --> 01:28:15,140
I didn't get a message.

1004
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:18,076
<i>This is not a matter
for employees, Mr. Chase.</i>

1005
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:20,145
<i>I talked to Martin.
I told him about the files.</i>

1006
01:28:20,178 --> 01:28:21,579
<i>Why didn't you tell him?</i>

1007
01:28:21,613 --> 01:28:23,048
When was that?

1008
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:24,716
<i>Before the motion in the first place.</i>

1009
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:26,293
No, when did you talk to
Martin and where was he?

1010
01:28:26,317 --> 01:28:28,119
<i>Early this afternoon.</i>

1011
01:30:21,032 --> 01:30:23,401
<i>Hello, this is the recorded
voice of Ben Chase.</i>

1012
01:30:23,434 --> 01:30:26,104
<i>Please leave your name and
number when you hear the beep.</i>

1013
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,942
Dammit, where are you? I don't
know what to do with these files.

1014
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:33,912
Doreen Clark, Phylis Gilder, Janet.

1015
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:37,248
They all had abortions here. Now, Dr.
Thiel never treated any of them,

1016
01:30:37,282 --> 01:30:38,683
but she had access to the files...

1017
01:30:43,821 --> 01:30:47,926
I see you know who I am. That's only
fair, since I know who you are.

1018
01:30:49,727 --> 01:30:54,165
You're Janet's friend and you
must be Ben's friend, too.

1019
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:57,302
His little helper.

1020
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:03,341
I should have known.

1021
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:07,912
Poor, unfaithful Ben.

1022
01:32:10,842 --> 01:32:12,677
This is all Ben's fault.

1023
01:32:13,645 --> 01:32:15,213
You know that.

1024
01:33:01,793 --> 01:33:02,927
No!

1025
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,195
No! No!

1026
01:33:04,228 --> 01:33:05,763
Ellen!

1027
01:33:05,797 --> 01:33:08,366
Ellen. It's me! It's Ben!

1028
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:09,701
Please.
Ellen!

1029
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:12,103
Ellen! Ellen!

1030
01:33:12,904 --> 01:33:13,938
Ben!

1031
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,191
Martin, you frightened me.

1032
01:34:08,326 --> 01:34:09,994
Is Mother here?

1033
01:34:10,027 --> 01:34:12,029
She's in her office working late again.

1034
01:34:13,164 --> 01:34:14,298
Thanks.

1035
01:34:28,012 --> 01:34:29,347
You're back.

1036
01:34:39,323 --> 01:34:40,491
Busy now?

1037
01:34:42,026 --> 01:34:43,628
Killing babies?

1038
01:35:21,532 --> 01:35:22,867
Dr. Thiel!

1039
01:35:25,269 --> 01:35:26,737
Dr. Thiel!

1040
01:35:45,857 --> 01:35:47,191
Yes?

1041
01:35:49,393 --> 01:35:50,661
Martin?

1042
01:35:50,695 --> 01:35:52,530
<i>You betrayed me, Ben.</i>

1043
01:35:54,532 --> 01:35:55,833
Where are you?

1044
01:35:55,867 --> 01:35:57,869
<i>You have no one to blame but yourself.</i>

1045
01:35:57,902 --> 01:35:59,604
Are you at your mother's?

1046
01:36:01,205 --> 01:36:02,874
<i>I have no mother.</i>

1047
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:09,013
Martin, what does that mean?

1048
01:36:09,046 --> 01:36:11,949
<i>It means there's only
the two of us, you and me.</i>

1049
01:36:13,484 --> 01:36:15,019
<i>I need to see you.</i>

1050
01:36:15,052 --> 01:36:17,688
<i>9:00 tomorrow night
at River Point.</i>

1051
01:36:17,722 --> 01:36:19,991
<i>You and no one else.</i>

1052
01:36:21,559 --> 01:36:23,227
<i>Promise me that, Ben.</i>

1053
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,498
<i>Promise me, Ben.</i>

1054
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,572
I promise.

1055
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,442
That was him, wasn't it?

1056
01:36:43,781 --> 01:36:45,516
I've gotta kill him.

1057
01:36:51,255 --> 01:36:52,990
It's not worth it.

1058
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:56,994
It is to me.

1059
01:37:42,506 --> 01:37:45,643
Ben, I saw the look in your eyes back there.

1060
01:37:45,676 --> 01:37:47,645
I know that look.

1061
01:37:47,678 --> 01:37:50,648
I have seen it on so many husbands,
and mothers and fathers.

1062
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:52,683
And on the worst nights,
I've looked in the mirror

1063
01:37:52,717 --> 01:37:55,486
and seen it in my own eyes.

1064
01:37:55,519 --> 01:37:58,289
But when the light comes up,

1065
01:37:58,322 --> 01:38:00,858
I always know that you've
got to let the law have it.

1066
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:02,994
That's exactly what he's counting on.

1067
01:38:03,027 --> 01:38:04,862
You'll arrest him.
Read him his rights.

1068
01:38:04,895 --> 01:38:07,565
Let him make a phone call to call
the best lawyer money can buy

1069
01:38:07,598 --> 01:38:10,201
and the whole thing will start over.

1070
01:38:10,234 --> 01:38:12,403
What's the alternative?
Murder?

1071
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,476
It'll be self-defense.

1072
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:20,011
Or I'll make it look that way.

1073
01:38:20,044 --> 01:38:23,014
It's not how it'll look.
It's how it'll feel.

1074
01:38:24,582 --> 01:38:26,117
It'll feel good.

1075
01:38:30,855 --> 01:38:33,290
Ben, you'll be just like him.

1076
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:56,480
Ben.

1077
01:38:57,548 --> 01:38:59,750
Over here.
Follow the wires.

1078
01:39:10,494 --> 01:39:12,396
I'm breaking the rules.

1079
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:15,199
You didn't bring any flowers, either.

1080
01:39:15,232 --> 01:39:17,868
You're pretty goddamn chipper.

1081
01:39:17,902 --> 01:39:21,238
What have I got to
worry about? I'm dying.

1082
01:39:24,408 --> 01:39:25,810
I didn't know.

1083
01:39:27,344 --> 01:39:29,480
Last time we talked, I didn't know.

1084
01:39:29,513 --> 01:39:33,184
Sure you did. We're all dying, all the time.

1085
01:39:35,619 --> 01:39:36,887
Don't remind me.

1086
01:39:36,921 --> 01:39:39,090
It's good to be reminded.

1087
01:39:39,123 --> 01:39:41,959
It's the only thing the
dead can do for the living.

1088
01:39:43,928 --> 01:39:46,430
Well, in the meantime,
what can I do for you?

1089
01:39:48,432 --> 01:39:50,267
Got any new quotes?

1090
01:39:50,301 --> 01:39:51,802
I thought you gave that up.

1091
01:39:51,836 --> 01:39:53,504
Too late to break the habit.

1092
01:39:57,174 --> 01:39:59,210
I've been thinking about an old one.

1093
01:40:01,212 --> 01:40:04,715
"There's no such thing as
justice, in or out of court."

1094
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:07,685
Clarence Darrow.

1095
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:12,389
And what do you think he meant?

1096
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:17,161
That law and justice
are two different things.

1097
01:40:18,829 --> 01:40:20,798
They're not the same.

1098
01:40:20,831 --> 01:40:22,533
At least not here and now.

1099
01:40:22,566 --> 01:40:26,103
Not anywhere, not ever.
They're never the same.

1100
01:40:26,137 --> 01:40:27,671
Where does that leave you?

1101
01:40:30,241 --> 01:40:34,378
When I was just out of law
school, I went to Washington.

1102
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:36,313
And the only thing I wanted to see

1103
01:40:36,347 --> 01:40:39,383
was a Justice of the Supreme Court.

1104
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:42,853
I couldn't imagine what such an
exalted being would look like.

1105
01:40:44,588 --> 01:40:46,924
I went to the Court, and waited outside.

1106
01:40:48,726 --> 01:40:50,661
I saw Louis Brandeis.

1107
01:40:51,896 --> 01:40:53,531
It was like seeing Zeus.

1108
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:56,167
I held my breath.

1109
01:40:58,002 --> 01:41:01,038
Then, he stepped on a patch
of ice hidden in a shadow

1110
01:41:01,071 --> 01:41:03,741
and did the most perfect
pratfall I ever saw.

1111
01:41:05,543 --> 01:41:08,245
I rushed forward and helped him up.

1112
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:10,981
He wasn't hurt.
He wasn't embarrassed.

1113
01:41:11,015 --> 01:41:14,351
I was.

1114
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:17,121
He just thanked me,
and left me standing there.

1115
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:21,325
Then I looked up

1116
01:41:21,358 --> 01:41:23,160
and saw that the shadow fell

1117
01:41:23,194 --> 01:41:26,030
from one of the gleaming statues.

1118
01:41:26,063 --> 01:41:29,867
The figure that represents abstract justice.

1119
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:33,838
Brandeis was just a human being.

1120
01:41:33,871 --> 01:41:38,042
Trying to keep his balance in pursuit
of an ideal that is always above us.

1121
01:41:40,878 --> 01:41:43,981
The law is the dark shadow of justice.

1122
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:49,220
It does not shine.

1123
01:41:49,253 --> 01:41:53,224
It's not even the same shape,
but it is connected.

1124
01:41:53,257 --> 01:41:56,994
We know what casts the shadow,
and it's as close as we can get.

1125
01:42:08,739 --> 01:42:10,241
I've gotta go.

1126
01:42:11,842 --> 01:42:13,077
So do I.

1127
01:42:24,822 --> 01:42:26,957
Court will grant us time.

1128
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:28,392
Your Honor,

1129
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:30,427
defense would have no objection, of course.

1130
01:42:30,461 --> 01:42:32,896
But I assure the court
that the facts are simple.

1131
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,098
And the rule clearly...

1132
01:42:34,131 --> 01:42:36,267
Your Honor, this is the most technical

1133
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:39,036
and insignificant violation
of the man's rights.

1134
01:42:39,837 --> 01:42:41,839
No fucking way. No way.

1135
01:42:41,872 --> 01:42:44,008
You've got no choice, Mesel.

1136
01:42:44,041 --> 01:42:46,076
It's me he wants.

1137
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,978
Anybody else shows up, he won't be there.

1138
01:42:48,012 --> 01:42:50,214
Why didn't you tell us this last night?

1139
01:42:51,215 --> 01:42:52,950
I have to do this.

1140
01:42:53,951 --> 01:42:55,919
Do what, Ben?

1141
01:42:55,953 --> 01:42:59,857
I'm here. I'm gonna
let you have him.

1142
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,059
But you gotta let me be part of it.

1143
01:43:03,627 --> 01:43:05,829
Why should we?

1144
01:43:05,863 --> 01:43:09,500
Have to be on the record. Everything
you've been up to is gonna come out.

1145
01:43:09,533 --> 01:43:11,669
I'm past worrying about that, Jean.

1146
01:43:11,702 --> 01:43:13,170
Way past.

1147
01:43:15,005 --> 01:43:16,674
Liberating, ain't it?

1148
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:20,010
What do you say?

1149
01:43:23,013 --> 01:43:25,382
We say yes, if it makes sense.

1150
01:43:28,185 --> 01:43:30,154
I wanna wear a bug.

1151
01:43:30,187 --> 01:43:31,322
You're still his lawyer.

1152
01:43:31,355 --> 01:43:33,290
I won't be after the first minute.

1153
01:43:33,324 --> 01:43:35,959
I'll return his retainer, and tell
him I no longer represent him

1154
01:43:35,993 --> 01:43:38,033
and try to get him to talk
about his mother's death.

1155
01:43:38,062 --> 01:43:40,864
If you're not his lawyer, why
should he tell you anything?

1156
01:43:40,898 --> 01:43:43,667
I know him.
I know him well enough.

1157
01:43:45,269 --> 01:43:47,404
We have a rather special relationship.

1158
01:43:47,438 --> 01:43:49,340
If he tumbles to the wire, he'll kill you.

1159
01:43:49,373 --> 01:43:50,974
Let me worry about that.

1160
01:43:51,008 --> 01:43:52,976
Look, Sonny.

1161
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:55,355
Don't think for a second that I
give a damn what happens to you.

1162
01:43:55,379 --> 01:43:59,683
But this is our business. If there's
one thing we can tell you it's this:

1163
01:43:59,717 --> 01:44:03,554
A crazy killer is crazy.
And he will kill you.

1164
01:44:06,123 --> 01:44:07,391
I know.

1165
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:11,362
Okay.

1166
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:16,567
9:00. The park
at River Point.

1167
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,335
Come by the office
at 6:00.

1168
01:44:18,369 --> 01:44:20,137
We'll rig the equipment.

1169
01:44:31,315 --> 01:44:32,916
You bastard!

1170
01:44:34,818 --> 01:44:37,087
You bastard! You promised!

1171
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,289
Come on!

1172
01:44:40,124 --> 01:44:41,592
You son of a bitch!

1173
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,460
You promised me!

1174
01:44:43,494 --> 01:44:45,396
You promised me!

1175
01:45:13,624 --> 01:45:14,992
I love the rain.

1176
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:20,864
After the purifying fire,
the cleansing rain.

1177
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:33,110
I'm glad we've come back here, Ben.

1178
01:45:34,044 --> 01:45:36,046
It was a good time for us.

1179
01:45:51,495 --> 01:45:53,330
Get me the hostage unit, the SWAT team,

1180
01:45:53,363 --> 01:45:55,098
and the paramedics!
Clear the building!

1181
01:45:55,132 --> 01:45:56,400
Keep your men back from there.

1182
01:45:59,203 --> 01:46:01,538
It's good to know how things really are.

1183
01:46:03,307 --> 01:46:05,375
Even if I have to be alone.

1184
01:46:05,409 --> 01:46:08,345
Even if you're not with me.

1185
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:15,285
What did you want me to do?

1186
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:17,788
Hold them down?
Find innocent women...

1187
01:46:17,821 --> 01:46:20,023
Innocent women?

1188
01:46:23,227 --> 01:46:25,195
What about their babies?

1189
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:29,199
More innocent than angels.

1190
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,038
That's all over now.

1191
01:46:35,072 --> 01:46:38,375
But it was never the point
between us, Ben. Never.

1192
01:46:42,012 --> 01:46:45,382
You've missed the heart of what
I've been trying to tell you.

1193
01:46:47,518 --> 01:46:48,652
And what is the heart of it?

1194
01:46:48,685 --> 01:46:51,421
That you must judge for yourself.

1195
01:46:51,455 --> 01:46:55,425
And you must act on that
judgment, whatever the cost.

1196
01:47:10,607 --> 01:47:13,744
You were great. You were
so great in here, Ben.

1197
01:47:13,777 --> 01:47:16,079
You saved my life.

1198
01:47:16,113 --> 01:47:19,383
And I haven't forgotten that.
I'll prove it.

1199
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:22,119
I have your life here
at the end of my finger.

1200
01:47:24,154 --> 01:47:25,622
I can take it, or spare it.

1201
01:47:25,656 --> 01:47:27,124
But what difference does it make,

1202
01:47:27,157 --> 01:47:29,159
if you don't save your own soul?

1203
01:47:30,794 --> 01:47:32,563
You think I should be stopped,

1204
01:47:32,596 --> 01:47:35,165
just as I know my mother had to be stopped.

1205
01:47:37,501 --> 01:47:40,904
But I acted on my belief.

1206
01:47:41,505 --> 01:47:42,806
Can you?

1207
01:47:44,841 --> 01:47:46,076
Can you?

1208
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:53,617
What if I was to tell you that I'm going
to put up a sham insanity defense,

1209
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:56,019
so I can be free again in a few years?

1210
01:47:59,256 --> 01:48:02,292
Would that make you see that
you must judge for yourself?

1211
01:48:08,165 --> 01:48:10,167
What if I gave you the gun?

1212
01:48:38,462 --> 01:48:42,232
What if I asked you what the punishment
should be for attacking Ellen?

1213
01:48:44,968 --> 01:48:47,838
I would have raped her.
I would have killed her.

1214
01:48:51,008 --> 01:48:53,010
I would have burned her.

1215
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:56,747
What is your judgment?

1216
01:49:00,684 --> 01:49:02,919
Show me what I've taught you, Ben.

1217
01:49:07,391 --> 01:49:08,892
Save yourself.

1218
01:49:11,495 --> 01:49:12,663
Save me.

1219
01:49:35,852 --> 01:49:37,054
Poor Ben.

1220
01:49:57,708 --> 01:49:58,709
Drop it!
