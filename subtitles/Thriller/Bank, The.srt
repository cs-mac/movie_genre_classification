1
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:43,105
Another "Terry Leather
Low Mileage" done.

2
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,566
Good you're glad, but have you all
sorted out for your wedding tomorrow?

3
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:46,817
Yeah, of course, Terry.

4
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,986
New suit, two buttons,
9 inch fun flaps.

5
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,198
<i>Nice. Ingrid will like that.</i>

6
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,533
So, you're getting married
tomorrow, Ingrid?

7
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,452
I hope so.

8
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,536
Go on, get off now.

9
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,456
Go make yoursef more beautiful
than you already are.

10
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,667
If that's possible.

11
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,877
Terry.

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,379
Promise you won't get Eddie too
legless tonight, will you?

13
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,589
At his stag do?

14
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,674
We're just going round the pub,
couple of pints and a sing song.

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,187
Oh, fuck..

16
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:29,693
Fuck it, what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

17
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:32,279
I've got Jessul's money.

18
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:34,156
The problem is, it's
tied up in these cars,

19
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,158
and you wankers want to
trash the lot of 'em.

20
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,327
Mr. Jessul doesn't care
about your inventory.

21
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:40,162
Mr. Jessul wants to know
that he's getting paid.

22
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,789
Any day, I swear, Perky.

23
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,291
What did you call me?

24
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,168
I called you Perky, Perky!

25
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:48,546
Everyone calls you
Perky, and him Pinkey.

26
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,381
- Pinkey and Perky?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,299
They're fucking cartoon
pigs on the telly,

28
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:54,593
what, people call us
that behind our backs?

29
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,387
Well, they're not gonna say
it to your face, aren't they?

30
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,181
Well, you just bloody did!

31
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:03,686
Yeah well, you got me rattled.
I'm very intimidated.

32
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:13,028
Don't make us come back again.

33
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:23,414
Not every customer is
a satisfied customer.

34
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,332
What are you doing round
here, my dear Martine?

35
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,500
What are you doing tonight?

36
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:29,170
Tonight? Tonight is
Eddie's stag do.

37
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,630
Taking him out for a drink. Why?

38
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,883
I've got a proposition
for you, Terry.

39
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,009
A proposition?

40
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,178
Can you meet me at the Player's
Club before you see the boys?

41
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,680
And I'll fill you
in on the details.

42
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,056
Make it 9 o'clock.

43
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,188
- Morning, Gale.
- Good morning, Tim.

44
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:49,982
Top floor? Summoned by the gods?

45
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:50,941
Something like that.

46
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,776
Got up for your new
mistress this weekend?

47
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,989
I don't know what you're talking
about, I'm a married man.

48
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,909
What do you think,
am I presentable?

49
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,703
Not sure about the tie, darling.

50
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:05,623
What's this? "Peace and Love"?

51
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:09,710
Too much of that nonsense and
we're both out of a job.

52
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:14,048
Michael Abdul Malik.
Calls himself Michael X,

53
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,926
in homage to Malcolm X,
his American counterpart.

54
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:20,262
The Pinko press would have
us believe this Michael X

55
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,932
is a crusading champion of
the poor and oppressed.

56
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,601
And the black Robin
Hood of Notting Hill.

57
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:29,063
The richer, whiter and more famous,
the more they fall over him

58
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,315
The truth is, he's a slum
landlord, a drug dealer

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,859
and a vicious pimp who should
have been in prison years ago.

60
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,366
Are you not charging outrageous rents
to my brothers and sisters, Mr. Brown?

61
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:43,577
I'm charging the same as your
slum-lord friend Lew Vogel.

62
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:46,580
Ten quids a week is too
much for these shitholes.

63
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,749
You know,

64
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,753
I always wanted to meet a white
man by the name of Brown.

65
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:58,092
You know what this is?
It's a slave collar.

66
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,678
And a white man made my
mothers and fathers wear this

67
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,263
to bend them to his will.

68
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:08,269
Can I bend you to
my will, Mr. Brown?

69
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,564
You sure got a faithful
dog now, Michael.

70
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:15,734
Michael, I don't think we
should get our hopes up here.

71
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,278
Kidnappning, extortion,

72
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,530
assault on this man Brown here,

73
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,866
as well as your previous
problems with the law, I mean..

74
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,951
You could be looking
at 10 to 20 years.

75
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:28,873
I don't think so. I am smarter and
better protected than whitey thinks.

76
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,249
<i>All rise.</i>

77
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,547
<i>It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail</i>

78
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,965
<i>by threatening to release</i>

79
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,052
damning photographs of a certain..
royal personage.

80
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,851
Until we get our hands on these
snaps, the police can't move.

81
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,519
The public prosecutor
won't move..

82
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,313
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

83
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,899
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

84
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:57,985
Yes, but at the minute
I'm not at liberty..

85
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,820
to say who that person is.

86
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,323
We've had Michael X under
surveillance for quite a while.

87
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:04,074
He keeps a safe deposit
box at the Lloyd's Bank..

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,658
in Marylebone.

89
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:07,578
We believe that's where
the photos are located.

90
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,665
Seems straightforward enough.

91
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:12,875
I'll send a team into this bank

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,835
and take whatever he's got
in this safe deposit box.

93
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,421
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level,

94
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,423
and that's not going to happen.

95
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,510
Do you see our problem?

96
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:25,513
There can be no
connection to 5 or 6.

97
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,056
So you want me to come
up with something

98
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,517
to avoid getting
accountability for anyone.

99
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,560
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

100
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:35,439
And if it all goes pear-shaped, I
assume it's my arse on the line?

101
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:39,777
You're young and ambitions, Tim. A
chance to make a name for yourself.

102
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:41,737
Thank you, Sir.

103
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:50,412
Excuse me there, miss.
Can I have a word?

104
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,330
Yes.

105
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,583
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

106
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:00,714
- I'll have to check your underwear.
- Be my guest.

107
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,759
- We found what we're looking for.
- Found what?

108
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,135
What were you looking for?

109
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,599
Oh Tim, thank God!

110
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:12,893
I'm in a spot of bother.

111
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,272
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

112
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,482
I was in Morocco recently.

113
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:21,735
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

114
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,113
Drinks are on me.

115
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,494
So, we're gonna sit here all
night, making small-talk?

116
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:34,623
I know you, Terry, and
I know your mates.

117
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,959
You've always been looking
for the big score,

118
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,044
the one that makes
sense of everything.

119
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,841
- I have it for you.
- What?

120
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:48,971
- A bank.
- A bank.. as in robber?

121
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,892
What would you
know about a bank?

122
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,561
I've been seeing this guy
who runs his own business.

123
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:56,979
Security systems.

124
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:01,108
Next month, they're installing new
alarms in a bank at Marylebone.

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,443
Seems like the
trains have been..

126
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:03,903
setting off the trembler
alarms in the vault

127
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:05,779
and they've had
to turn them off.

128
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,407
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

129
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:12,494
Now why would he
tell you all this?

130
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,997
We were having a laugh about it.

131
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:18,584
Imagine if half the villains in in
London knew about this, he said.

132
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,128
And I thought, I know half
the villains in London.

133
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:22,963
I grew up with some of them.

134
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:26,467
Look, me and my mates might have
been involved in the odd bit of

135
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,843
skullduggery.

136
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:28,802
Can you see us tooled up,

137
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:30,471
taking on a bank
like the James gang?

138
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,307
This isn't about waving a
waterpistol at a cashier's head.

139
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,144
This is about getting into the
basement where the deposit boxes are.

140
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,689
Hidden, secret wealth. Money and
jewels, they're safe to steal,

141
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:43,150
- 'cause people won't report it.
- Oh, no no no.

142
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,611
You can't talk about this here.

143
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,489
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

144
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,658
We can't pass it up.

145
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:55,579
I didn't expect this from
you tonight, Martine.

146
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,332
What did you expect?

147
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,382
I'll have to think about it.

148
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,051
You better get off
to your stag party.

149
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,387
Thanks for the drink.

150
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,561
Eddie tells me his brother
invited you to the wedding.

151
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,939
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

152
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,117
Can I get a Campari and Soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,582
Thank you.

154
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,750
Well, Tim sweety,
what do you think?

155
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,128
- Is he offering?
- Maybe.

156
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,006
Cheers, gorgeous.

157
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,486
- So you coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

158
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:12,281
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

159
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,408
I guess I've got time.

160
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:34,220
- What exactly do you do?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

161
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,888
How did you and Hakim meet?

162
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,641
I met Hakim in Los
Angeles last spring.

163
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,935
He was rasing money for a
black Montessori school

164
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,394
and writing his life's story.

165
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,522
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

166
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:49,193
The book is called "From the
Dead Level, Malcolm X and Me."

167
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,820
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet.

168
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:53,906
The voice of the black soul.

169
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:55,449
A friend is throwing
a thing next week

170
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,451
to celebrate the launch
of Brother Hakim's book,

171
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,495
and you are all invited.

172
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,206
Hakim, tell us more
about your book.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,545
It's about being born
black in America.

174
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:11,257
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

175
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:15,928
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

176
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,138
to bring a black baby
into this world?

177
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:44,665
Good evening, sir.

178
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,473
What, you freakhead? Why are we
even having this conversation?

179
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:02,391
We're not-

180
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,727
Here's your beer.

181
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,523
<i>We are not bankrobbers.</i>

182
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,942
Maybe that's why we
could get away with it.

183
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,944
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

184
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,487
You know what scares me more?

185
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,990
Living and dying with
nothing to show for it.

186
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,660
You know how old Mozart was when
he composed his first minuet?

187
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:24,622
- No.
- Five. Five! A fucking minuet!

188
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,665
And how would you know
that fact, Terry?

189
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,793
Because it's tattooed on
that stripper's arse, Kevin.

190
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,129
What the fuck's it
matter how I know?

191
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,089
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

192
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,216
What I'm trying to say is,

193
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:36,717
we stop fucking about and stop..

194
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,427
picking the shit from
under our fingernails.

195
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,222
Shtum, lads. Coppers
at 12 o'clock.

196
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,110
Damn..

197
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:58,405
What are you two doing
here, personally?

198
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,616
I thought you were way past
being a bagman, Jerry.

199
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:04,662
Your associate Sonia Bern has raised
prices at that knocking shop of hers.

200
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,623
- £120 quid up from a £100.
- And your point?

201
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:10,417
A rising tide lifts
all ships, mate.

202
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,837
I think we are owed some money.

203
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,631
- Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you would do that, wouldn't you?

204
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:17,716
You'd kill the goose that
lays you golden eggs.

205
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,426
Wouldn't that be dumb, would it?

206
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,554
But then again, everyone
knows coppers are dumb.

207
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,057
Now you can do one thing for me.

208
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:31,313
You stop your collegues from having
their boys night out in my clubs.

209
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:39,321
They're loud, they're lewd and
they expect free oral sex.

210
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:44,994
You know what, that's disgusting. Ya
know, most of them have families.

211
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,787
We'll pass the word along.

212
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,219
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies..

213
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,054
to find their perks elsewhere.

214
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,681
No one is going to bother me.

215
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:08,976
My patrons could have a lot of these
old coppers put out to pasture.

216
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,145
Well, I'd say, spread the wealth
around and keep the peace.

217
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,397
Five quid a week extra.

218
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,317
- It's all it's worth.
- I'll pass it on.

219
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:30,873
- Drysdale.
- Urquhart.

220
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:37,171
Lord Drysdale, can I offer you
a drink before your session?

221
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:40,925
Very kind of you, Sonia.

222
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:46,013
- Good to see you.
- As well, Urquhart, as well.

223
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:52,895
Good girl.

224
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,733
Tighter! Yes,
that's a good girl.

225
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:03,781
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

226
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:19,588
Louder.

227
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:21,590
Louder!

228
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,300
Come on.

229
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,476
<i>We want a kiss, what's
wrong with you?</i>

230
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,105
- I just can't.
- Come on..

231
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,607
<i>Give her a snogging, babe.</i>

232
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,168
Hello.

233
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,836
Saw you in a magazine
the other day.

234
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,630
The Campari ad on the beach.
Nice.

235
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,841
Must have been an old one,
I'm not modeling any more.

236
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:07,052
I don't know why. You're
still a knockout.

237
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,597
- What are you doing these days, Dave?
- Me?

238
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,766
A bit of film work.
Extra, you know.

239
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:14,810
And you, Kevin? You're
still snapping, I see.

240
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:15,603
The wedding photos?

241
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,229
No no, these are just
photos for the family.

242
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:19,523
Fashion is my game.
Fashion and passports.

243
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,526
- And the odd snap of a wayward husband.
- Thank you, Dave.

244
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,361
So, what's the verdict, boys?

245
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,156
We're interested.

246
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,033
First thing we should do is
take a look at the place,

247
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,117
suss it out.

248
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,453
- Maybe open a box of our own.
- I've already done that.

249
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,288
We can go and have
a look tomorrow.

250
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,500
Tomorrow it is.

251
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,461
Heads up, lads.

252
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,380
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She is off.

253
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:45,466
And what a gorgeous flower
girl your eldest made.

254
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,009
Thanks. Catherine.

255
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,887
I do envy you.

256
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,347
- Kev, you want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

257
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:52,723
It was lovely to see you all.

258
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,225
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

259
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,352
- All right, mate.
- All right.

260
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,565
She envies me.. She's
being sarcastic?

261
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,694
I suppose what she meant was,
money can't by what we have.

262
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,072
Didn't you use to
go out with her?

263
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:09,782
No love, that was Kevin.

264
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,159
He had this big thing for her.

265
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:14,954
- And you didn't?
- No.

266
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,915
Not like me and you,
love at first sight.

267
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:18,999
Oh yeah..

268
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,337
I remember that night, you were with
your mate Audrey at that disco.

269
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,215
I saw this gorgeous little
bum in a pencil skirt

270
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,759
and I thought: "Oh,
I've gotta have that."

271
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:31,053
But that Audrey she already
had a bloke, so I pulled you.

272
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,388
Cheeky sod.

273
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:37,977
Daddy, daddy, come and dance with me.
Come on, dad.

274
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:56,704
Hands off me.

275
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,187
Good morning.

276
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:23,689
I'd like to access my
safe deposit box, please.

277
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:26,859
- Martine Love. L-O-V-E.
- Certainly, madam.

278
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,669
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

279
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,588
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

280
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,591
Yeah, right.

281
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,639
So what are these
films you're in?

282
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:57,848
Forget about it.

283
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,099
Go on.

284
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,978
Technically, it's
what you'd call..

285
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:04,522
pornography.

286
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,857
- You're joking?
- No.

287
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,609
So you've been going
around town with a

288
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,694
12 inch mutton dagger
hanging down your pants?

289
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,614
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

290
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:47,314
Nice.

291
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,024
Fake.

292
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,652
For the posh party
at the weekend.

293
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:08,335
This is the one. The
lease is available.

294
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:18,888
Finally.

295
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:22,391
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

296
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,934
Here we go.

297
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:27,313
So how come you've got the inside
dope on this place, Martine?

298
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:29,732
She knows this bloke,
runs a security company.

299
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:32,234
Bloke? Is it serious? Are
you getting married?

300
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,446
He is married. All
the best ones are.

301
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,655
Here we go.

302
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:39,742
Marylebone Road and Baker Street,
on the corner here is the bank,

303
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:43,329
next door is the Chicken
Inn, and at 189, Le Sac.

304
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:45,164
In the back here is an
underground car park

305
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,750
with direct access to
the shops' basements.

306
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,793
We can pull in here from
Glentworth Street..

307
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:50,586
into the car park

308
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,339
for dropoffs and pickups without
being seen from the street.

309
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,382
We'll dig a tunnel from
the basement of the shop

310
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:58,636
under the Chicken Inn and pop
up in the safe deposit vault.

311
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,471
I've got a question.

312
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,182
What do us lot know
about digging tunnels?

313
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:03,682
Nothing.

314
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,476
But I know a man who does.

315
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:09,146
- So what do you reckon, Bambas?
- What do I reckon?

316
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:13,192
I reckon I know you guys,
but I don't know her.

317
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,236
Don't worry about
Martine, she's solid.

318
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,153
We go way back.

319
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,822
Terry, you have been up to
some mischief in your time

320
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,826
but this, this is serious
shit, my friend.

321
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,702
Don't you think it's a
little out of your league?

322
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:26,997
Maybe it's time we stepped
up to the first division.

323
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,337
There's going to be reinforced
concrete under the vault.

324
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,757
We're going to need a thermic
lance, a jackhammer, a generator,

325
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,634
lights, ropes,
cables, the works.

326
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,928
It's about 40 feet of digging
before we're under the bank.

327
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:43,222
We can hire some Micks from
Camden Town to do the digging

328
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,598
That's brilliant, Dave.

329
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:47,184
Why don't we just pay their
national ensurance contributions?

330
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,812
And then you have to get dirt
on your Tommy Nutter suit.

331
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,273
- This way, Michael. One more shot.
- This way.

332
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,775
Thank you, that was great.

333
00:21:56,193 --> 00:22:00,030
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad..

334
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:02,241
to liberate my
brothers and sisters

335
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:05,327
from the enslavement of
the British colonialists.

336
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:08,497
What about the charges you are facing?
How can you leave England?

337
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:10,624
They are liars and cowards.

338
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,085
If they had anything against
me but their fear of me,

339
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,171
I'd be tried and jailed.

340
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:16,714
See you later, Bambas.

341
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,465
But we gonna need a
front man on this,

342
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:21,135
someone who can sign the lease on
the shop and looks the business.

343
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,013
I know someone, Guy Singer.
Calls himself "The Major".

344
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:25,890
But that's a lot of bollocks,

345
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,560
He has got this white posh accent
if anyone comes nosing about.

346
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:34,356
A bit tight under the
arms, don't you think?

347
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,609
Traditional fit, sir.

348
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,694
One can't raise ones
arms above one's head.

349
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,572
It tends to inhibit any
impulsive acts of surrender.

350
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,994
I'll be right back, sir.

351
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,413
What on earth are
you doing here?

352
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:52,875
Got a bit of business for you, Guy.
You'll be tempted.

353
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,677
Sit down, luv.

354
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,971
What do you think you're doing?

355
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:07,723
Taking the E for a test drive.

356
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:09,475
Tell your boss, he can
have his inventory back

357
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,976
when he settles
Mr. Jessul's debt.

358
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,020
And it'd better be soon

359
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:16,315
or we'll be back to tap
through his kneecaps.

360
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:21,529
If I was you two, I was
looking for another job.

361
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,661
Lovely.

362
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,538
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

363
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:37,127
So, come on then, what don't I know?
Romantic dinner on a Monday night?

364
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:45,177
Look honey,

365
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:49,515
I'm going to be working some strange
hours over the next week or two, so..

366
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:53,060
don't ask me what I'm doing, because
I don't want to lie to you.

367
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,229
What are you doing?

368
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:58,023
Look..

369
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:02,820
I know I've caused us a few problems
but those cars aren't selling

370
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:06,866
All I was trying to do is
get ahead of the game.

371
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:09,160
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- OK.

372
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:10,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

373
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,080
And a better place.

374
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,332
It's for all of us.

375
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:19,044
For you and the kids.

376
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,422
And how afraid do I
have to be, Terry?

377
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:31,432
It'd be the best smart thing if you
wanted to stay with your aunt,

378
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:35,060
in case things to custard.

379
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:47,198
So, we are settled. 25% to run my
girls till I return from Trinidad.

380
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:50,159
It's all right, you
don't have to worry.

381
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:53,621
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

382
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:56,916
As long as you remember
they are not your own.

383
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:58,209
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,

384
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,211
I can arrange for shipment
of some high grade gunja.

385
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:01,837
Not interested.

386
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:03,589
You want my opinion?

387
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:05,341
I think drugs are
responsible for..

388
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,259
the moral decay of
this countries' young.

389
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:09,970
Smut, smut and more smut.

390
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:11,764
That's my special
area of interest.

391
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:12,848
You should think about it.

392
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:14,642
With these goodies you
can make a lot of dough,

393
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:16,227
especially the police
in your pocket.

394
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:18,145
I am paying enough
bung as it is,

395
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,980
but probably not as
much as you're donating

396
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,650
to be permitted to
leave our fair shores.

397
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:27,238
Not a shilling! I have something so
special, I don't need to pay anyone.

398
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:29,281
And what would that be, Michael?

399
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,200
Sorry, Lew.

400
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,701
Well.

401
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:35,830
Whatever it is, you crafty bugger,
I hope you're keeping it safe.

402
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:40,292
Yes, as safe as it can be. In
the place that you recommended.

403
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,838
- You're late.
- Sorry.

404
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,550
This is the Major.
Major Guy Singer.

405
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,343
Final member of our team.

406
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,554
I don't know this man.
Who are you?

407
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,180
None of your business.

408
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:55,641
No secrets around here. The
Major is a con artist.

409
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,518
Usually elderly widows.

410
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,019
There's no need
to bring that up.

411
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,397
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

412
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:03,816
Handbags and leather accesories
for the discerning lady.

413
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:05,526
Nice.

414
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,320
I told the district planner's
office about the remodelling.

415
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:12,324
They gave me the specs for the sewage,
drainage, gas and power lines.

416
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,202
We'll have to go deep
to miss that lot.

417
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:16,620
What's this for?

418
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,666
That is the thermic lance. It
cuts through concrete and metal.

419
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:24,837
We're doing this, right? I mean,
we're bloody going for it.

420
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,255
Let's see what
this thing can do.

421
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,841
Good idea, Kev. Give us a
demonstration, Bambas.

422
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:30,718
Ok, hold this. Hold it. Here.

423
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,345
Kevin, go stand over
there by the oxygen.

424
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,930
Here we go.

425
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:51,238
Turn it off!

426
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,199
Off! Off! Off!

427
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:55,409
Not good.

428
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:57,244
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

429
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,955
Absolutely.
Professional criminals.

430
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,624
What's the worst case scenario?

431
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,292
They get caught and go to jail.

432
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,752
No possible connection to us.

433
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,795
What about this model
you're screwing?

434
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:08,839
What promises have you
made to keep her in line?

435
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:10,758
None that can't be broken.

436
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:13,302
Look, she's our only tie
to the bank operation.

437
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:14,637
If things do go belly up

438
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,348
it'll only take one cut
to sever the knot.

439
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,517
What's Gale Benson up to?

440
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:22,394
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

441
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,940
Could you sign that book, please?
I've got them finally together.

442
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:27,399
Daddy!

443
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,904
I am so glad you
decided to come.

444
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:35,658
This is my father,
Sir Leonard Plugge.

445
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,117
Always happy to meet
Gale's new friends.

446
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,203
Her new name is Hale Kimga.

447
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:42,164
It's an anagram of the
letters of our names:

448
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:43,916
Hakim and Gale.

449
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,419
- And your name is?
- Hakim. Hakim Jamal.

450
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:48,504
Right.

451
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,006
Excuse me..

452
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:58,973
Hello, gorgeous.

453
00:27:59,098 --> 00:28:00,307
So, where's the author?

454
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,434
He's over there, signing
his masterpiece.

455
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,436
Why don't you both drop
by the house this weekend

456
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:06,397
and introduce
Mr. Jamal to mother?

457
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:07,940
Sorry daddy, can't do that.

458
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,568
We're popping on to the
islands for a while.

459
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:15,072
- Let me get you a drink.
- Good luck with your book.

460
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:21,203
- So you've read this book of his?
- You must be joking.

461
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:23,789
Right. You're
probably undercover,

462
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:27,334
spying on Black Power's insidious
threat to the British way of life.

463
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:28,544
That's very funny.

464
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:31,505
Tell me, is our little
enterprise still shipshape?

465
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,132
We're currently
on schedule, Tim.

466
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:36,093
We're taking over the
shop on Friday afternoon.

467
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:38,596
I know if this stuffs
up I'm in poo poo land.

468
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:46,645
We have a blue Transit van
that's just pulled up.

469
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,647
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

470
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,275
And we have one man
entering the shop.

471
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,164
Construction crew, for Le Sac.

472
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,070
I've got a question.

473
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,281
What do we do with all the dirt
we're gonna dig out of the hole?

474
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:21,740
That's all been
worked out, Dave.

475
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:25,411
We'll dig another hole over
there and put in in that. Over.

476
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,373
If we're to get the job done before
the bank opens on Monday morning,

477
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:30,499
we better get a wriggle on.

478
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:31,834
Want to do the honours, Martine?

479
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:36,922
This is it, here we go.

480
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:38,716
Watch your nails, Martine.

481
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,800
Yeah, yeah.

482
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,720
Let's get this store to rock.

483
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:07,286
- Some racket there Alf?
- Bloody hell! What's going on?

484
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,472
Dave, come on, mate.

485
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:36,440
Dave, you need a break.
I'll take over.

486
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,234
Cheers, Major.

487
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,904
Heads up!

488
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,121
- Where's Dave?
- No idea.

489
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,002
Where did you get to?

490
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:58,838
Just checking the
door was locked.

491
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,757
Of course it's locked, Dave.
I locked it.

492
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,348
Hang on. What we got here?

493
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:13,060
A copper.

494
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:15,187
Christ, he's not going
in there, is he?

495
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:19,650
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, Dave, get back.

496
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,443
- I only wanted-
- Stop! Hold it down!

497
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,778
Someone is knocking.
Someone is at the door.

498
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,905
Stop, Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop.

499
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,116
Bambas!

500
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:29,201
Bambas! Hold on!

501
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,121
There's somebody at the door.

502
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,711
- Look, I don't mind going.
- It's my job.

503
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,429
Coppers.

504
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,014
It's the Old Bill.

505
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,482
Good evening. You're
working late?

506
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:03,777
Around the clock, officer.
Expanding our storage.

507
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:05,321
Trying to complete
renovations for the grand..

508
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,780
If you don't mind, sir.

509
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,410
Excuse me?

510
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:15,789
You using a jackhammer
down there?

511
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:18,167
Yeah. You had some
complaints, officer?

512
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,044
Yeah, from some of
your neighbours.

513
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:24,757
We'll try to keep
it down, alright?

514
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:26,634
Right.

515
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:34,016
I wonder how they talked
their way out of that one.

516
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,018
Tim, Quinn here.

517
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:39,271
We just had a copper
going into the shop.

518
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:41,482
<i>Not sure why, but he's gone now.</i>

519
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,070
All clear.

520
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,989
We need a lookout, someone
on a roof somewhere.

521
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:51,826
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

522
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,285
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

523
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,037
No. Look, we're not
cutting anyone else in.

524
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:56,539
We won't cut him in on the loot.

525
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,123
We'll give him the car lot.

526
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:00,668
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

527
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:03,587
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

528
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:04,922
Cover that up!

529
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:13,222
It's not the coppers.

530
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:21,605
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

531
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,650
- And what is it?
- Chicken and chips.

532
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,819
I see..

533
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,244
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

534
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:39,456
- You can't be serious.
- I was starving.

535
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:55,514
Radio is in the bag,
binoculars as well.

536
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,433
There's a bedsit on the top
floor of this building,

537
00:34:57,558 --> 00:34:59,185
paid for the week.

538
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:00,603
The ladder will get
you to the roof.

539
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:02,605
You're in from Liverpool,
looking for work.

540
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,939
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

541
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,774
Then don't talk
to anyone, Eddie.

542
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,734
I'm up on the roof, and..

543
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:50,319
I've got a good view

544
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:51,821
<i>of all directions, over.</i>

545
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:56,033
Are you in position, Nightjar?
Command HQ here. Acknowledge.

546
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:59,286
Yeah, I'm in position. I can
see the front of the bank,

547
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,372
Marylebone Road,

548
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:03,874
Baker Street, I can see
everything really well.

549
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,669
<i>All clear on the Western front, Guy.
Over.</i>

550
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:09,922
<i>- No names, Eddie.
- Sorry, Dave.</i>

551
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:13,217
Hey you delinquent.
What have I told you?

552
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,677
<i>No idle chitchat.</i>

553
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:17,179
Sorry, T- Over.

554
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:18,681
Fuckin' hell..

555
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:25,187
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

556
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:27,231
I'll keep an eye on the
shop from here on.

557
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:29,149
You two go down to
Glentworth Street.

558
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:30,651
Guard the parking garage exit.

559
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,027
Okay.

560
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:53,632
Nightjar here, there's some fellow
looking through the window.

561
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,261
<i>Hang on.</i>

562
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:01,056
Wait, hang on. He's going.
He's going.

563
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:03,058
Yeah, he's gone. Over.

564
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:08,272
Roger, Nightjar. Over and out.

565
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:11,233
I want to go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

566
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,194
Do you want anything?

567
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,863
A pack of Seniors.

568
00:37:15,946 --> 00:37:17,448
There you go, sir.

569
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:19,533
Two packets of Rothmans,

570
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:21,785
Two Senior Service and
8 bags of crisps.

571
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:22,578
Okay.

572
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:25,372
Hello, gorgeous. Are
we still on track?

573
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:28,334
We had a scare last night.
The cops came round.

574
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,586
Can't you pull rank and make
sure it doesn't happen again?

575
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:33,881
No, we can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

576
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,800
- I wish I was.
- How about your friend Terry?

577
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:39,136
Where is he planning to
carve up the proceeds?

578
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:42,765
Shit.

579
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,062
- A pint of ale, chief.
- What's wrong?

580
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:50,147
I needed to take a break.

581
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:52,274
Who's that you've
been talking to?

582
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:55,152
I wasn't. He was
trying to chat me up.

583
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,321
Does happen, you know.

584
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,032
<i>- Right.
- There you are.</i>

585
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:02,535
<i>- Cheers. Keep the change.
- Thank you.</i>

586
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,996
Now, what are you doing here?
Are you following me?

587
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:07,998
No.

588
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,545
- I just wanted a pint.
- Then enjoy it.

589
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,658
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

590
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,202
You're rather impressed with
our friend Hakim, aren't you?

591
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:48,622
I know rule #1: "Don't get
emotionally involved"

592
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:51,584
That doesn't mean I
can't enjoy my work.

593
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,377
You certainly do.

594
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:58,048
What does your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

595
00:38:58,299 --> 00:38:59,466
We are not amused.

596
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:02,178
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

597
00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:03,679
he would have a heart attack.

598
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:07,349
Here you are. Credit
cards and cash.

599
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,311
If he does have copies of the
photos and negatives there,

600
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:11,228
they will be hidden.

601
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:12,897
Find them. Destroy them.

602
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,815
And then get out.

603
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,817
Michael X thinks he's safe,
tucked away in Trinidad.

604
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,986
That will all change if
we're successful here.

605
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,072
Just remember, Gale: He's
a nasty piece of work.

606
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:27,119
He's a crazy dope-smoking lunatic
pimp extortionist, that's what he is.

607
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,082
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

608
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:35,211
Yeah, everything's
all right, mate.

609
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:37,713
Listen, what if I want
to go for a pee up here?

610
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:40,382
<i>I don't know. Use
your imagination.</i>

611
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:43,802
<i>Stay off the radio unless you
see any Old Bill, all right?</i>

612
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,348
<i>Yeah, all right. If I see any
Old Bill, I'll let you know.</i>

613
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,934
<i>I'll speak to you in a bit.
Over.</i>

614
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,317
Hey Bambas.

615
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,985
What's all this brickwork?

616
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,572
I don't know, it
wasn't on the plans.

617
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:04,657
Fuck!

618
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,952
<i>Terry? Fucking hell!</i>

619
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,163
<i>Terry! Bambas!</i>

620
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:12,748
Terry, talk to me!

621
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,085
Terry!

622
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:17,920
Oh fuck..

623
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:21,257
<i>Terry, talk to me!</i>

624
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:26,846
<i>- Are you all right?
- I think so, yeah.</i>

625
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,180
What happened?

626
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:30,891
<i>The floor just caved in.</i>

627
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,269
Bloody hell, Terry.
Don't do that to me.

628
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:34,562
- I thought you was a goner.
- Yeah.

629
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,814
Give us a light, Dave.

630
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,359
What's down there?

631
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:44,446
<i>- It's a pile of skeletons.
- You're joking.</i>

632
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,617
<i>Let's hope they're not the last
gang who tried to take this bank.</i>

633
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,416
Latin. Roughly translated:

634
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:57,751
Lamb of God, forgive
us our sins.

635
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:00,796
- How do you know Latin?
- Catholic school.

636
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,215
The Bleeding Heart sisters
of eternal misery.

637
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,426
Interesting date. 1665.

638
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,052
You all know what year
that was, don't you?

639
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:08,888
The last time West
Ham won the cup?

640
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:11,265
It was the great
plague of London.

641
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:13,475
This must be a burial chamber.

642
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:15,394
A crypt where they
dumped the bodies.

643
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,605
Well, if these poor
bastards had the plague,

644
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,190
they could be infectious.

645
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:20,774
I don't think so, Dave.

646
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:23,194
This crypt goes all the
way under the bank.

647
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:24,820
It'll put us in the
vault quicker.

648
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:28,532
And how we'll gonna do that?

649
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,716
Concrete.

650
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,927
Floor of the vault.

651
00:41:48,427 --> 00:41:50,179
Time to get paid
for all our work.

652
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:51,013
Right.

653
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:53,933
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

654
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,727
I'll be happy if we
don't hit the sewage.

655
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:45,401
When are you guys going
to hit the vault?

656
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:47,278
<i>I'm freezing my tits off up here.
Over.</i>

657
00:42:48,154 --> 00:42:50,114
<i>In the army, soldiers
would pull on</i>

658
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,700
<i>their puds to keep their
blood flowing. Over</i>

659
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:55,578
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

660
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,163
Over.

661
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,332
<i>Yes, we welcome new members.
Roger, over and out.</i>

662
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,752
<i>Emergency operator. Which
service do you require?</i>

663
00:43:03,836 --> 00:43:06,922
<i>- The police, please.
- Putting you through.</i>

664
00:43:07,047 --> 00:43:08,299
<i>Police here. Can I help you?</i>

665
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:09,884
Yes. I'm a HAM radio operator

666
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,887
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

667
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:29,153
We're in! Dave, get the ladder.

668
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:06,690
We're gonna move into the
vault after we take a break.

669
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:09,109
We need to let the
fumes clear out.

670
00:44:09,276 --> 00:44:11,153
You're having a laugh, ain't you?
Let's go in now.

671
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:15,366
Dave. Nothing's going nowhere.
I can hardly breathe in there.

672
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:19,495
- Nightjar, are you there? Over.
- Nightjar here, over.

673
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,247
<i>We're in. Over.</i>

674
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:24,041
What, in the actual vault?

675
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,709
Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

676
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:29,046
Great, great. That's great news.
Over.

677
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:31,549
We're taking a break.
We're knackered.

678
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:32,883
<i>I need to get some sleep.</i>

679
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:35,135
<i>Getting some shut-eye while
the fumes clear out. Over.</i>

680
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:39,515
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are
like organ stops. Over.</i>

681
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,101
<i>We can smell the money now.
Over.</i>

682
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:44,937
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

683
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,524
I want a warm bath and a cuppa tea.
Over.

684
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:51,360
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time.

685
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:54,530
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are
like organ stops.</i>

686
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:56,866
<i>We can smell the money now.</i>

687
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,826
I rang 4 other police
stations before you,

688
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:00,411
but nobody took me sriously.

689
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:02,621
Said it was probably a hoax.

690
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,623
How strong was the
signal, Mr. Addey?

691
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:06,750
I'd say they were within
a 10 mile radius.

692
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:09,753
There must be a ton of
banks in that area.

693
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:11,755
And when was the last
time you picked them up?

694
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,175
They've been quiet
for about an hour.

695
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:16,552
What about releasing the
tapes to the radio and TV?

696
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,345
Maybe somebody can
recognize the voices?

697
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,096
No, no.

698
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:21,849
If they hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

699
00:45:21,974 --> 00:45:23,475
No, we should keep listening.

700
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,436
Maybe they'll reveal
where they are.

701
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:28,022
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I am going back to the station.

702
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:30,483
You call me if you
hear anything.

703
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:30,459
<i>Hi.</i>

704
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:36,632
You scared the piss out of me.

705
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:42,137
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

706
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:46,433
Yeah, I'm a bit jangly myself..

707
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,479
I just had to come and have a look.
Our future is in those boxes.

708
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:57,945
So, what are you going
to do with your share?

709
00:46:58,028 --> 00:47:01,490
Vanish. Martine Love
will cease to exist.

710
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,788
Why, do you think if you vanish
you'll become someone else?

711
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:10,583
At least no one will
know who I was.

712
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:16,005
Why did you pick Kevin and me? You
could have found better thieves.

713
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,008
For old times' sake.

714
00:47:21,093 --> 00:47:23,012
Must be old times you
spent with Kevin,

715
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:24,930
not me.

716
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:28,475
Kevin has it in his mind that
we had this passionate affair.

717
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:29,977
The truth is, it came down

718
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:32,646
to 4 chinese meals and
a roll in the hay.

719
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:36,901
And that was a long time ago.

720
00:48:17,691 --> 00:48:18,609
All right,

721
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:20,236
let's make some money.

722
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:40,422
Look at this!

723
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:43,759
Look at all this cash.

724
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,011
Fantastic!

725
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:47,513
Guys? Gold bars.

726
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,306
Diamonds. Diamonds!

727
00:48:59,108 --> 00:49:00,693
Guys, what's going on?

728
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:03,863
How would your wife
fancy a tiara?

729
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:07,199
Too bloody right.

730
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:09,952
<i>Get the gas. The gas.</i>

731
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:11,662
<i>Look at it. Hold it.</i>

732
00:49:11,787 --> 00:49:13,789
- Emerald.
- It's like winning the Pools.

733
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:29,638
Dave. Give us a
hand with this one.

734
00:49:31,265 --> 00:49:33,976
- What's so special about this box?
- It's my lucky number.

735
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:42,526
All yours, me lovely.

736
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:44,653
- There you are.
- Cheers.

737
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,011
Holy shit. You know who that is?

738
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,971
It's Princess Margaret.

739
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:13,933
Terry, anything for the
widows and auctions funds?

740
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:18,646
- Will that do?
- God bless you, you're very generous.

741
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,606
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

742
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:22,525
You don't know what you are
throwing or what you are keeping.

743
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:23,901
Yeah, but we know what
money looks like.

744
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:26,153
We're not throwing
that away, are we?

745
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:36,956
How long does it
take to rob a bank?

746
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:41,252
<i>We're just about to end
this job now, yeah?</i>

747
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:42,169
Not yet.

748
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,755
Have a look at this.

749
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:02,106
No, nothing.

750
00:51:02,314 --> 00:51:03,232
Still nothing.

751
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:04,608
Sergeant, what we
need is something

752
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:06,318
that will motivate the
robbers to go on air,

753
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:09,363
<i>- give away their location.
- Right..</i>

754
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:11,365
Bait to lure the fish.

755
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,204
No, they are not there,
not transmitting.

756
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:18,664
They are not there, sir.

757
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:22,459
Move to the next
bank, Sierra Lima 2.

758
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,802
We still get nothing, Sarge.

759
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:35,723
Ok, unit Sierra Lima 2,
move to the next location.

760
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:40,686
My God, the stuff that
some people collect..

761
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,230
What have you got there, Terry?

762
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:44,857
- '47.
- '47?

763
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:46,901
Sounds like a good year to me.

764
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:50,988
Will you pass it round?

765
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:52,948
Come on, Terry. Give us some.

766
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:54,742
Got it.

767
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,461
Catch!

768
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:06,921
Oi! Yeah..

769
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:08,547
Here, Major.

770
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,298
Get it down.

771
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:10,591
<i>Listen fellows,
they are onto you.</i>

772
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:13,594
<i>Listen, they're onto you.
- Fuck.</i>

773
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:15,346
Coppers are on your doorstep.

774
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:22,394
Speak to me, Nightjar.

775
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:23,979
<i>Coppers right on your doorstep.</i>

776
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,106
Listen. Hang on, hang on..
they're not going in,

777
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,359
<i>but they are not going away.
Wait, wait.</i>

778
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:30,861
Sergeant, we just heard
the thieves' lookout

779
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:33,280
say that there are police
outside the bank right now.

780
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:35,449
- Which bank?
- I haven't got a clue.

781
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:37,660
We've got patrols outside half
the banks in the West End.

782
00:52:37,785 --> 00:52:40,579
Keep listening, we need to
pinpoint exactly where they are.

783
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:43,624
<i>Wait. Hang on.</i>

784
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:51,757
Guys, a black car just
pulled up with some bloke.

785
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,468
He's going up to the front
door with the cops.

786
00:52:57,513 --> 00:52:59,723
Guys, he is unlocking
the front door.

787
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,727
They are going in. Shit! Over.

788
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:07,731
Oh no. Shit.

789
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:11,402
- Where is the vault?
- Downstairs.

790
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,908
Follow me.

791
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:39,805
Looks fine.

792
00:53:40,306 --> 00:53:42,308
<i>Are you sure everything is all right?
Yes, yes, it is.</i>

793
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:45,561
- I want to look inside.
- Tell the timelock.

794
00:53:45,644 --> 00:53:47,980
Can't be opened until
tomorrow morning.

795
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,985
Well, it isn't my bank
that's being robbed.

796
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:59,283
Sorry for calling you on
a Sunday morning, sir.

797
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,869
- Not a problem..
- Thank you.

798
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,916
Fellows, I think
they are going away.

799
00:54:13,923 --> 00:54:15,090
They are gone.

800
00:54:23,557 --> 00:54:26,060
We should get out of here.
They could be coming back.

801
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:28,145
Yeah, right. We need
to let Eddie know.

802
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:30,022
Nightjar?

803
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:34,276
<i>Nightjar?</i>

804
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:35,736
No!

805
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:37,780
Fuck!

806
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:39,990
Shit. Fuck.

807
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:41,867
Shit. Shit.

808
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:44,453
Are you there, Nightjar?

809
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,667
The ambulance reports it's outside
the Lloyd's bank on Baker Street.

810
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,418
Nightjar, can you hear me?

811
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:55,381
<i>You gone to sleep, Nightjar?</i>

812
00:54:57,591 --> 00:54:59,593
Fucking hell..

813
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,183
Nightjar, are you there?

814
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:08,644
Look, if he's not picking
up, something is wrong.

815
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:09,937
You're right.

816
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,313
So, grab all the
cash and the jewels

817
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:12,398
and get the fuck out of here.

818
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:13,482
What about our gear?

819
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:14,984
We cant leave anything
that might incriminate us.

820
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:15,985
We come back for it if we can.

821
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,027
What about all the other boxes?

822
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:19,446
Doesn't matter, Dave. Put
everything in a bag and lets go!

823
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:21,448
All right, let's move it.
Come on!

824
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:27,788
- There's nothing here, Sarge.
- Are you sure?

825
00:55:27,913 --> 00:55:30,040
There's no mention
of the ambulance.

826
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:32,501
Nothing. Move on, Sierra Lima 2.

827
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:46,640
- Let's go!
- Finally.

828
00:55:46,765 --> 00:55:47,850
Come on, let's go.

829
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,188
The van is leaving. We
will follow them. Over.

830
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,315
Stop them as soon as possible.

831
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,827
Open the door!

832
00:56:07,703 --> 00:56:10,331
- What have I done, guv'nor?
- Open the back door, come on.

833
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,250
Some fella paid me 50
quid to pick up his van

834
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:15,127
and drop it at Heathrow airport.

835
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:19,381
Jesus Christ..

836
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:22,426
- Wher's the van?
- Change of plan.

837
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,011
Precautionary measure.

838
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:26,472
I've organised
alternative transport.

839
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:28,974
- Why?
- None of us have met your boyfriend.

840
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,435
He's all go to include you
on the back of the job.

841
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:34,021
Could've set us up.

842
00:56:38,692 --> 00:56:40,069
We bloody well pulled it off.

843
00:56:40,194 --> 00:56:42,196
Done with military
precision, hey, major?

844
00:56:42,321 --> 00:56:43,531
Now that I am fiscally secure,

845
00:56:43,656 --> 00:56:45,324
I think I'll promote
myself to "Colonel".

846
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:48,410
<i>You know what I am going to do?</i>

847
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:50,913
I'm going to buy my mom a new house.
Something with a garden.

848
00:56:51,038 --> 00:56:52,832
I thought you would be
off to Copenhagen, Dave?

849
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:56,710
- Why would I go to Copenhagen?
- Heavy cock, sure hunt.

850
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:58,462
You know what I'll do?
I'll chop off one more

851
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,923
and then I got one like
your little pinkey.

852
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:28,701
How did you find this
place then, Terry?

853
00:57:29,785 --> 00:57:30,744
A bloke and I used to run a..

854
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:32,204
chop shop here.

855
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:33,706
He's in the nick now.

856
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:36,167
How could you lose control
of the operation?

857
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,460
I thought you were on
top of this thing.

858
00:57:38,627 --> 00:57:39,670
Sir, it worked.

859
00:57:39,795 --> 00:57:41,255
They did the job. They
robbed the vault.

860
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,924
And we have no idea where
the fuck they are.

861
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:46,886
You know, an ugly thought
has just occured.

862
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,430
Lots of money in that
vault, juwelry, bonds.

863
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,349
You and your sweetie haven't cooked
up something between you, I hope.

864
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:54,310
- You think I'd betray you?
- There are precedents.

865
00:57:54,393 --> 00:57:56,979
Two of our former colleagues
now live in bloody Moscow.

866
00:57:57,104 --> 00:57:58,731
Let's hope they don't
have another bidder.

867
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:00,983
She won't cross us. She knows
what we're capable of.

868
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:03,569
How does she even know
who the hell we are?

869
00:58:03,694 --> 00:58:06,489
I'm sure she will contact me
when she comes to her senses.

870
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:09,116
Going anywhere else would
be a death sentence.

871
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:11,160
You better hope she
does, Everett.

872
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:13,662
Or it may be yours.

873
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:26,592
Here you go, Bambas.
That's your lot.

874
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:32,056
"Never washed after our magic moment.
Snookie."

875
00:58:38,062 --> 00:58:41,023
Hey, Dave. Look at this.

876
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:46,862
I've seen this bloke on the TV.
The old perv.

877
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:50,157
I have seen this face before.
He's an M.P..

878
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:53,327
Lord.. whatshisname, you know.
Always wears those poncey bow ties.

879
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,287
Well, on that picture he's not.

880
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,790
I believe this is one of
your old movies, Dave.

881
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,792
Piss off, Kev.

882
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:01,544
Timely suggestion.

883
00:59:01,669 --> 00:59:04,672
I believe I'll take my
share and be on my way,

884
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:07,216
before the bank opens
in the morning

885
00:59:07,383 --> 00:59:08,592
and the shit hits
the proverbial fan.

886
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:09,552
I'm with you, Guy.

887
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:10,928
I don't have to remind you:

888
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,973
Keep a low profile. No buying
Aston Martins, Bambas.

889
00:59:14,098 --> 00:59:17,309
The only thing I'm buying is a
one-way ticket back to Cyprus.

890
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:19,770
- I'm never coming back.
- We should have a reunion.

891
00:59:19,854 --> 00:59:24,024
- 20 years, the Savoy Grill.
- Yeah, right, maybe for you, Guy.

892
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,986
I still wouldn't let us lot in.

893
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:29,572
- Bambas.
- Goodbye my friend.

894
00:59:29,822 --> 00:59:31,407
Take care of yourself, mate.

895
00:59:32,116 --> 00:59:33,117
Major.

896
00:59:37,997 --> 00:59:39,582
Be lucky.

897
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,000
Bambas.

898
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:43,377
Goodbye, old chap.

899
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:51,552
Okay, what's going on? You
two have been staring

900
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:53,345
daggers at each other
since we left the bank

901
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:56,557
What is it? Lover's tiff?

902
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:05,107
I think Martine has got
something to tell us.

903
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:11,989
Hang about. That's
Princess Margaret.

904
01:00:12,198 --> 01:00:13,491
Fuck me..

905
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:18,746
Where do these come from?

906
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:21,457
You knew the exact box this
stuff was in, Martine.

907
01:00:21,957 --> 01:00:24,919
You'd better come clean and tell
us what this is really about.

908
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:31,425
About a month ago I got busted
at Heathrow on a drug charge.

909
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:34,345
This guy I know said he would
fix it to keep me out of jail,

910
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:36,597
if I do him a favour.

911
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:38,140
He knew I knew some villains.

912
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:40,976
He wanted to set up a
robbery to get these.

913
01:00:41,477 --> 01:00:42,812
Fucking hell!

914
01:00:42,895 --> 01:00:44,897
That would be the bloke you
met in the Player's Club.

915
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:48,359
Same guy you said was trying to
pick you up in The Globe, right?

916
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:50,069
- Yeah.
- Well, so who is he?

917
01:00:50,194 --> 01:00:52,363
He's a guy I met at
the Sombrero Club.

918
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:54,740
He works for some shady
outfit in Whitehall.

919
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:57,618
- Oh no, no. You mean MI fucking 5?
- Or 6?

920
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:00,287
We could get seriously
nicked here, Martine!

921
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:01,497
No, we couldn't.

922
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,833
All Tim wants is the
contents of box 118.

923
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:07,002
The deal with him is, we get
to keep everything else.

924
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,547
And you believe that?

925
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:12,174
You put your trust in some
prick we've never even met.

926
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:13,509
You lied to us, Martine!

927
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,261
We were sitting ducks
right from ther start.

928
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:16,554
Thank you very much.

929
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:19,098
You think it's a coincidence
that you get busted for drugs

930
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:21,475
and your Tim just happens to
have a plan to rob a bank?

931
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:23,269
This can work out.

932
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:25,521
We give him the photos and
everything else in that box

933
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:27,481
and we get to keep the rest
and we're free and clear.

934
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:29,316
These people are regular
cozzers , Martine.

935
01:01:29,441 --> 01:01:30,526
They are above that.

936
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:31,819
They do things coppers can't.

937
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:35,614
They think we've seen these photos,
we're expendable as dog shit.

938
01:01:35,823 --> 01:01:37,158
You know what?

939
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:38,701
I've seen our shots and I know..

940
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:41,412
we're either dog shit or
about to be dog shit.

941
01:01:41,704 --> 01:01:42,872
I'm out of here.

942
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:46,542
I'm not waiting for a load of spooks
and coppers to come cracking my head.

943
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:47,793
I'm splitting like
Guy and Bambas.

944
01:01:47,877 --> 01:01:49,420
It would be better if we
stuck together, Dave.

945
01:01:49,545 --> 01:01:53,090
And why, Tel?, 'cause we've been so
truthful with each other so far?

946
01:01:54,091 --> 01:01:57,219
- Dave, come on..
- No, I'm going home, Kev. See me mom.

947
01:01:57,344 --> 01:02:00,389
And then I'm going far away, as
far as I can get away from you.

948
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:09,190
We'd better get out of here, too. In
case Guy and Bambas get picked up.

949
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:10,941
Let's split the lot of this.

950
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,819
There may be someone else in this
shit to cause us some more grief.

951
01:02:18,616 --> 01:02:21,368
- One of those, mate.
- Here you go.

952
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,913
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

953
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:34,256
- They overheard our radio chat.
- Fuckin' hell..

954
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:41,472
"Police last night were trying to
home in on a £300.000 bank raid."

955
01:02:41,555 --> 01:02:43,182
They still don't know
what bank it was.

956
01:02:43,307 --> 01:02:45,684
- 300 grand?
- It's a bit more than that..

957
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:47,019
More like 3 million.

958
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:20,928
- Hello?
- Martine Love.

959
01:03:21,053 --> 01:03:24,181
Thank God. Put her through
and then run a trace.

960
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:25,599
<i>It's me.</i>

961
01:03:25,808 --> 01:03:27,518
What happened? Where
the hell are you?

962
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:28,185
London.

963
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,812
I know, of course.
I mean, where?

964
01:03:29,895 --> 01:03:30,729
I know what you mean.

965
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:31,897
Martine, we have to meet.

966
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:34,233
I agree. Why don't you
come over to my place?

967
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:35,860
I'll make you a cocktail,

968
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:38,195
and we'll have a roll in the
hay for old times' sake.

969
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:41,574
Oh, right. You would have
been there, haven't you?

970
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:43,993
Probably have your men
keeping lookout for me now.

971
01:03:44,076 --> 01:03:46,162
You're not in a position
to play games, Martine.

972
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:48,414
No threats please, Tim.

973
01:03:48,497 --> 01:03:51,292
Why didn't you tell me what it
was I was set up to get you?

974
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,877
For your own good.

975
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,503
I care about your
safety, Martine.

976
01:03:54,712 --> 01:03:56,130
Right.

977
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:00,384
I suppose I give you what you
want and we go our separate ways.

978
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:01,886
That's what I promised.

979
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,471
Ok, today. Tottenham
Court Road Tube.

980
01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:07,641
Northern isle, northbound platform.
10:30 sharp.

981
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:10,811
Tottenham Court Road, 10:30.
Good.

982
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:15,274
"London vaults checked after
radio HAM tunes in to a crime."

983
01:04:15,524 --> 01:04:18,444
Christ, what a fiasco!

984
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:20,529
And now the particular
bank has been identified,

985
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,323
the story will be
all over the news.

986
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:24,158
We've heard it already is.

987
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,953
If we don't get onto
the case quickly

988
01:04:28,078 --> 01:04:29,497
the police will have
nabbed these robbers,

989
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,582
and God knows what will
happen to our photographs.

990
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,335
Philip, get over to the bank.

991
01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:36,504
Take control of the situation.

992
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:41,509
Gentlemen. I've just had a
conversation with one Martine Love.

993
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:43,010
Where is she?

994
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:45,554
Call was traced to a public
phone box in Earl's Court.

995
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,473
Good news is, she's
arranged a meet.

996
01:04:47,598 --> 01:04:48,641
That is good news.

997
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:50,226
- I'll be better off going alone.
- Yeah.

998
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:53,646
Tim has agreed to meet.

999
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:56,941
It's all over the news. They
found the location of the bank.

1000
01:04:58,025 --> 01:04:59,401
So what?

1001
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:05,783
Keep the change.

1002
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:09,161
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't go in.

1003
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:10,204
There's been a robbery.

1004
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,456
We know there's been a robbery,
that's why we're all here.

1005
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:27,972
<i>Everybody that works here.
I need everybody. Speak to him.</i>

1006
01:05:28,764 --> 01:05:30,349
Gerald?

1007
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:33,018
You work in robbery now then?

1008
01:05:33,102 --> 01:05:34,770
You're a long way
off your patch.

1009
01:05:34,854 --> 01:05:36,355
Regional crime squad now.

1010
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:38,566
Just went by to see what
all the fuss is about.

1011
01:05:38,691 --> 01:05:40,609
Pretty cheeky, that radio bit.

1012
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:44,113
These walkie-talkie robbers certainly
caught your lot on the hop.

1013
01:05:44,196 --> 01:05:45,781
Makes us all look stupid.

1014
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:46,657
Yeah, well..

1015
01:05:46,907 --> 01:05:49,118
You're pretty chummy with all
the villains around town.

1016
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:51,704
You got any idea who
could have done this?

1017
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:53,539
None of my informants.

1018
01:05:55,124 --> 01:05:56,876
We have been waiting
here quite some time,

1019
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,170
and so far you people have
told us absolutely nothing.

1020
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:01,172
If you would like to
give us an itemized list

1021
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:03,507
of the content of your boxes,
we may be able to ascertain..

1022
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:04,925
- Are you mad?
- .. what's missing.

1023
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:06,468
The whole point in having
a safe deposit box

1024
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:09,597
is so that people like you
don't know what's in it!

1025
01:06:11,056 --> 01:06:13,350
I want to speak to a Roy Given.

1026
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:14,477
Yeah, that's me.

1027
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,604
This robbery is now a matter
of national security.

1028
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,022
I want everybody out.

1029
01:06:18,147 --> 01:06:19,607
This is a police investigation.

1030
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:22,526
Not anymore. Call
your superiors.

1031
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:25,905
Who the bloody hell
does he think he is?

1032
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:30,075
Spooks. MI-5 or 6, I can
never tell the difference.

1033
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:31,577
They all got the same tailor

1034
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,787
and they all went to the
same bloody school.

1035
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:35,623
Let's get some copies of the..

1036
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:37,583
walkie-talkie tapes
out to the news boys.

1037
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:40,878
Maybe the public can help
identify the villains.

1038
01:06:41,879 --> 01:06:45,049
So tell me.. Which of the
boxes were ransacked?

1039
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:48,761
The lot. 100s through to 400s.

1040
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:53,808
Oh, well we're in a crapper, Jerry.
Both of us.

1041
01:06:53,933 --> 01:06:55,893
Both? Now, why is it my problem?

1042
01:06:55,976 --> 01:06:58,562
Accounts have to be
balanced records kept.

1043
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:01,565
And I wouldn't likely keep the
books around here, now would I?

1044
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,109
Spell it out, Lew.
Be more specific.

1045
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,612
I have a ledger,

1046
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,906
a record of every payment

1047
01:07:09,156 --> 01:07:10,908
I've ever made to you
and your colleagues.

1048
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:13,244
It was in my safety deposit box,

1049
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:15,037
and I think we can
safely assume..

1050
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:16,997
it's now in the possession
of the robbers.

1051
01:07:17,122 --> 01:07:18,833
Jesus wept.

1052
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,000
And I think you'll agree

1053
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,753
we have to find those villains
before your honest colleagues do.

1054
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,171
For fuck's sake.

1055
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:32,638
Who is this?

1056
01:07:32,763 --> 01:07:34,223
<i>Lew Vogel.</i>

1057
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:36,016
Hold on. Get up.

1058
01:07:36,308 --> 01:07:37,935
Come on, wake up.

1059
01:07:40,604 --> 01:07:42,106
What do you want, Lew?

1060
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:46,152
<i>I'm afraid I've got some potentially
bad news for you, Michael.</i>

1061
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:49,488
Your safety deposit box at
the Baker Street bank..

1062
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:51,157
what's its number?

1063
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,408
Why do you ask?

1064
01:07:52,533 --> 01:07:54,660
<i>Well, because some thieves broke
into the bank vault and robbed it.</i>

1065
01:07:56,162 --> 01:07:57,997
So if your box is in the
100 to 400 numbers,

1066
01:07:58,122 --> 01:07:59,915
I'm afraid all your
stuff will be gone.

1067
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:01,458
<i>Mine too, unhappily.</i>

1068
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,169
What? How can this
happen in London?

1069
01:08:03,294 --> 01:08:04,879
<i>Well, I promise you
it has happened.</i>

1070
01:08:04,962 --> 01:08:07,423
I promise you these thieves
will be found and dealt with.

1071
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:10,384
<i>You can rely on it.
I'll keep you informed.</i>

1072
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:11,802
Thank you.

1073
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:18,118
No-one touches me, follows me
or Martine takes your stuff..

1074
01:09:18,202 --> 01:09:21,080
right to Fleet
Street, understood?

1075
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:28,879
You want box 118, Tim.

1076
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:31,549
You have no idea of the danger you
and your chums are in, do you?

1077
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:33,592
Is that right? And
what would that be?

1078
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:36,095
You've opened Pandora's box,
you dumb prick, that's why.

1079
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:37,847
I know what's at stake.

1080
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:39,640
And I know how
expendable we are.

1081
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:40,891
Some change in the deal.

1082
01:09:41,016 --> 01:09:42,518
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah..

1083
01:09:42,601 --> 01:09:46,397
You'll get all your nasty
pictures, but here's the twist:

1084
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,984
We'll get indemnity, fresh passports,
safe passage out of the country.

1085
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:51,360
For the whole team.

1086
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:52,903
And an officially
signed document

1087
01:09:53,028 --> 01:09:55,489
guaranteeing we won't be prosecuted
and we won't be pursued.

1088
01:09:55,656 --> 01:09:57,449
You can't be serious?

1089
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,285
You can bet your
bollocks I'm serious.

1090
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,704
I want it signed and
delivered by a public figure

1091
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:03,539
of substantial authority.

1092
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:04,915
How about the Prime Minister?

1093
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,293
Yeah, he'll do, if you can
drag him off his yacht.

1094
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:09,420
You mess with us, Tim..

1095
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:13,716
We can drip-feed pictures
like this to the press.

1096
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:20,431
We've got a stack of 'em.

1097
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:22,975
Oh, do you?

1098
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:27,855
You've got until 4pm to
confirm that we have a deal.

1099
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:29,648
We'll be in touch.

1100
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:35,905
Some photographs.

1101
01:10:36,405 --> 01:10:37,948
Well done, Tim!

1102
01:10:50,794 --> 01:10:52,171
Do you have any more?

1103
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:55,883
Apparently there is a whole rogues
gallery stored in one of those boxes.

1104
01:11:03,057 --> 01:11:05,226
If Lord Drysdale is up to
his usual hanky-panky,

1105
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:06,727
that's his problem.

1106
01:11:07,394 --> 01:11:10,481
This operation is about recovering
the photos from Michael X.

1107
01:11:10,564 --> 01:11:12,691
Might it not be prudent
to get the committee

1108
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:13,943
to consider issuing
a "D notice"?

1109
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:17,112
To protect everyone potentially

1110
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:19,198
embarrassed by this
criminal activity.

1111
01:11:19,406 --> 01:11:21,742
Which we instigated.

1112
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,081
<i>Very nice. Very nice indeed.</i>

1113
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:33,254
When I came out there were a
couple of lads taking some photos.

1114
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:34,755
Buddies of him.

1115
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:38,592
He was standing right outside the bank
just a few days before it was robbed.

1116
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:41,679
I thought at the time
he looked a bit shifty.

1117
01:11:45,307 --> 01:11:47,184
Christ, is that thing real?

1118
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,270
I've got it.

1119
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:51,897
Dave Shilling. That's his name.

1120
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:54,984
Tata, mom.

1121
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:57,027
Look after yourself, son.

1122
01:11:57,528 --> 01:12:00,489
Go, get yourself inside.
You'll catch your death.

1123
01:12:05,786 --> 01:12:08,455
- Dave Shilling?
- Yeah?

1124
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:10,416
I wonder if we
could have a word.

1125
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,128
- About what?
- About a bank.

1126
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,178
I want to tell you
something, Mr. Shilling,

1127
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:23,679
because it will save time.

1128
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,681
You see,

1129
01:12:26,599 --> 01:12:28,642
I have a very jaundiced
view of life.

1130
01:12:29,727 --> 01:12:32,855
From what I see, most of it
is corrupt, venal and vile.

1131
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:35,524
And I am just saying
this so that you know

1132
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:37,568
that I don't have a better
nature to appeal to,

1133
01:12:37,693 --> 01:12:40,738
or a compassionate streak. I mean,
you do understand, don't you?

1134
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:42,406
I think so, Mr. Vogel.

1135
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,782
Good.

1136
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:48,913
I have a kidney stone,

1137
01:12:49,038 --> 01:12:52,333
I don't seem to be able to pass.
I'm on painkillers.

1138
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,169
I could use a couple
of those myself.

1139
01:13:01,509 --> 01:13:03,260
You stole from me

1140
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:06,514
and from friends of mine.

1141
01:13:08,682 --> 01:13:11,393
- Where is my stuff?
- I don't know.

1142
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:14,480
Look, I don't know anything
about any bank robbery. Honest.

1143
01:13:14,563 --> 01:13:17,191
You're still an unconvincing
actor, Mr. Shilling.

1144
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,619
I would love to say this
is not going to hurt,

1145
01:13:28,911 --> 01:13:30,204
but it is.

1146
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,924
What are you going to do?

1147
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:44,009
Please, no! No.

1148
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:47,388
Stop. Please.

1149
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:48,264
No.

1150
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:58,357
- Well, they were here.
- What are you gonna do?

1151
01:14:01,193 --> 01:14:02,820
Why is the door open?

1152
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,869
Who are you?

1153
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:11,787
I could ask the same thing.

1154
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:13,998
You better run along, eh?

1155
01:14:15,124 --> 01:14:16,333
Get yourselves a cup
of tea or something.

1156
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,471
We are looking for
Terry Leather.

1157
01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:30,014
Terry said he would not
be coming in this week.

1158
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:31,724
He is supposed to call in.

1159
01:14:32,892 --> 01:14:35,978
- So you would be Eddie, right?
- Uh, yeah?

1160
01:14:36,061 --> 01:14:37,313
Well, you're coming with me!

1161
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:38,397
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!

1162
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:40,274
What are you going
to do with my Eddie?

1163
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,775
- Just relax.
- Leave her alone!

1164
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:43,652
We want to talk to him
about a bank robbery.

1165
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:44,361
<i>Don't you touch her!</i>

1166
01:14:44,487 --> 01:14:46,113
If you want to see your Eddie
or his mate Dave again,

1167
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,157
make sure Terry Leather
calls that number.

1168
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:51,285
Walkie-talkie gang takes it all.

1169
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,786
Read all about it.

1170
01:14:53,704 --> 01:14:55,789
Walkie-talkie gang
takes it all..

1171
01:14:56,248 --> 01:14:59,293
<i>- That's great news. Over.
- We're taking a break.</i>

1172
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:00,669
<i>We need to get some sleep.</i>

1173
01:15:00,836 --> 01:15:03,214
<i>Getting a shut-eye. I want
the fumes cleared out. Over.</i>

1174
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:05,925
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are like..</i>

1175
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,469
Mommy? Daddy is on the radio.

1176
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:09,887
Don't be so silly, darling.

1177
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:11,430
He is!

1178
01:15:12,014 --> 01:15:13,349
Is he?

1179
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:15,768
<i>I want a warm bath and a cup of tea.
Over.</i>

1180
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:19,313
<i>You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time. Over.</i>

1181
01:15:19,438 --> 01:15:20,856
See? It is daddy.

1182
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:23,234
<i>Authorities have released this
recording of the walkie-talkie</i>

1183
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,028
<i>communications between the robbers
of Lloyds Bank in Marylebone</i>

1184
01:15:26,195 --> 01:15:27,738
<i>in the hopes that their voices</i>

1185
01:15:27,905 --> 01:15:29,698
<i>may be identified by
members of the public..</i>

1186
01:15:30,157 --> 01:15:31,367
Hello?

1187
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:33,327
Wendy?

1188
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:35,830
We heard you on the radio, Terry.
You are famous, you know?

1189
01:15:35,955 --> 01:15:38,999
You robbed that bank, didn't you?
The one on the news.

1190
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,461
Oh God, you could go to jail for years
for something like that, Terry.

1191
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:43,546
I couldn't stand it.

1192
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:44,922
No one is going to jail.

1193
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:46,465
I've got everyone under control.

1194
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:49,176
Just stay put. Keep
the kids inside.

1195
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:52,596
I love you, Wendy.

1196
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:55,015
I gotta go.

1197
01:15:55,933 --> 01:15:57,226
You be careful, Terry.

1198
01:15:57,309 --> 01:15:58,602
<i>What's the matter, mom?</i>

1199
01:15:59,353 --> 01:16:00,729
Nothing, darling.

1200
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:08,362
- Terry, they took Eddie.
- Oh God. Who?

1201
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:12,032
They didn't have fleece on. I don't
know, they could have been cops.

1202
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:13,868
They left a phone
number for you.

1203
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:16,078
They said, if I want to
see Dave or Eddie again,

1204
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:17,371
then you'll have to call.

1205
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:19,165
Listen to me, I swear to
you we'll get them back.

1206
01:16:19,248 --> 01:16:20,749
Don't you worry, darling.

1207
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:22,751
Have you got a pen?

1208
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,128
Yeah.

1209
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:27,214
<i>- 0-1-9-4-6.
- Hold on, say it again.</i>

1210
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:31,051
<i>0-1-9-4-6. - Yeah.</i>

1211
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:36,807
Michael? It's Lew Vogel. Yes.

1212
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:38,809
Well, we've identified
the villains.

1213
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:41,270
<i>Believe it or not, they're amateurs.
Part-timers.</i>

1214
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:44,690
They were put up to the job by
a woman named Martine Love.

1215
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:46,317
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of her.

1216
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,985
Well, we paid a
visit to her flat,

1217
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:50,196
and some chaps from MI-5
were already there.

1218
01:16:50,613 --> 01:16:53,032
Pulled rank on my tame copper.

1219
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:56,202
Why do you suppose these
people would be interested

1220
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:58,162
in the robbery of a minor
neighbourhood bank, Michael?

1221
01:16:58,287 --> 01:17:00,915
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

1222
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,293
And I'm guessing that
your box is number 118?

1223
01:17:04,877 --> 01:17:07,922
<i>I think what these robbers were
really after were photographs.</i>

1224
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:10,508
Photographs of a certain
Royal Princess.

1225
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:11,967
How do you know that?

1226
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,720
Because on this point,
I believe my captive.

1227
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:17,723
No man could withstand the
pain we inflicted on him.

1228
01:17:18,307 --> 01:17:20,226
So don't take me for
a fool, Michael!

1229
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:21,644
You've instigated this calamity

1230
01:17:21,727 --> 01:17:23,771
by storing your blackmail
materials in this bank.

1231
01:17:24,146 --> 01:17:25,064
Which you recommended.

1232
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:27,107
I will not be lectured by
the porn king of Soho.

1233
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:28,651
Get my pictures back,

1234
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:31,195
or you will never see a black
man on the streets of London

1235
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:33,614
without wondering if he's
been sent to kill you!

1236
01:17:54,677 --> 01:17:56,011
What are you doing?

1237
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:59,306
Oh, hello Michael. Hakim was
looking for a copy of his book.

1238
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,852
I know what you've
been looking for.

1239
01:18:02,977 --> 01:18:04,478
You won't find it.

1240
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:06,605
What are you talking about?

1241
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:10,151
<i>Hakim, I found your book.</i>

1242
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,528
You don't understand.

1243
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:15,281
My box and those of my friends

1244
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:17,283
may have been rifled.

1245
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:19,034
Surely you can
pull some strings.

1246
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:20,870
You're a minister in the
government, for God's sake!

1247
01:18:21,078 --> 01:18:23,664
Sonia, I really don't think
I am able to help here.

1248
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:25,749
Perhaps you don't
fully comprehend.

1249
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:29,962
I have photographs,
compromising photographs,

1250
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:32,006
live films of you,

1251
01:18:32,089 --> 01:18:34,550
Miles Urquhart, all my regulars,

1252
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:37,428
in this safe deposit box.

1253
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:40,431
You all know each other if
that's any consolation.

1254
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,225
You've got photographs of me?

1255
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,811
You conniving cunt!

1256
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:50,774
You be a big boy.

1257
01:18:51,317 --> 01:18:53,152
Now is the time to talk
to your White Hall chums,

1258
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:54,236
don't you think?

1259
01:18:56,614 --> 01:18:58,949
That's him. Sure that's him.

1260
01:19:00,493 --> 01:19:03,245
Guy Arthur Singer, con
man and petty criminal.

1261
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:05,789
Did a stretch in the
"Scrubs" a few years back.

1262
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:08,626
I thought he was a wanker.
Spoke with some poncey accent.

1263
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:11,879
Thank you, sir, very much.

1264
01:19:18,302 --> 01:19:20,429
- Hello?
- Who am I talking to?

1265
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:24,642
Terry Leather, Kevin Swain,
Martine Love, Eddie Burton.

1266
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:27,144
Yeah, Mr. Shilling was kind enough
to speak with me about this.

1267
01:19:27,603 --> 01:19:28,938
You put Dave on the phone.

1268
01:19:29,104 --> 01:19:30,481
Now, I would, but..

1269
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:33,192
he seems a bit indisposed
at the moment.

1270
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:35,027
<i>What do you want?</i>

1271
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:37,071
Just a couple of things
from what you've stolen.

1272
01:19:37,196 --> 01:19:39,615
A ledger with a dark red cover.

1273
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:40,825
And some photos

1274
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:43,494
that I'm sure the MI-5
is interested in.

1275
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:45,579
The "Royal portfolio".

1276
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:48,749
All we got is money and jewels.

1277
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:50,584
Then I suggest you look again.

1278
01:19:51,377 --> 01:19:52,503
Speak to your friends.

1279
01:19:52,628 --> 01:19:55,214
- Hello, who is this?
- Eddie, it's Terry.

1280
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:56,131
Terry..

1281
01:19:56,674 --> 01:19:57,967
Terry, fucking hell.

1282
01:19:59,343 --> 01:20:00,386
Dave's all messed up,

1283
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,513
and they're going to do the
same to me, you got to help.

1284
01:20:03,013 --> 01:20:04,140
Listen to me, Eddie.

1285
01:20:05,307 --> 01:20:06,725
I don't have what he wants.

1286
01:20:06,892 --> 01:20:10,187
No? No, you've got to have
what they want, you've got to.

1287
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,481
You've got to help.

1288
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:15,276
Eddie, what am I supposed to do?
You tell him, we don't have it!

1289
01:20:15,651 --> 01:20:17,528
- No, Terry. Terry, you gotta-
- Eddie,

1290
01:20:17,695 --> 01:20:20,072
Tell him I don't have
his fucking ledger!

1291
01:20:20,364 --> 01:20:22,283
<i>You tell that cunt now!</i>

1292
01:20:23,659 --> 01:20:25,494
He doesn't have it..

1293
01:20:26,328 --> 01:20:27,329
Right.

1294
01:20:29,456 --> 01:20:30,249
Wait..

1295
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:31,458
No! No!

1296
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:34,628
No! They shot Dave!

1297
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,505
- Eddie?
- Dave is dead.

1298
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,632
- Eddie!
- They shot him, Terry..

1299
01:20:41,886 --> 01:20:44,138
I'll give you one hour
to find what I want,

1300
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,015
<i>or I'll kill this man.</i>

1301
01:21:03,949 --> 01:21:05,534
This is it.

1302
01:21:06,952 --> 01:21:08,078
Lew Vogel.

1303
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:10,581
That's what this bastard is.

1304
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:16,420
"Payments made to Soho and
West End division officers"

1305
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:23,219
There are weekly payouts.
50 quid here, 20 there.

1306
01:21:24,595 --> 01:21:26,972
Probably every bad
copper in London.

1307
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,975
Nothing like this was
supposed to happen.

1308
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,352
No one was supposed to get hurt.

1309
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:32,812
It's not your fault, right?

1310
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:34,897
We still got our own exit
to think about, and Eddie.

1311
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,150
If we give the photos to Vogel,
all bets are off with Tim.

1312
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:40,861
If we deliver it to
Tim, it's Eddie's neck

1313
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:42,655
and Vogel is still after us.

1314
01:21:42,738 --> 01:21:44,448
Either way we are fucked.

1315
01:21:48,661 --> 01:21:50,663
Miles, we've got a problem,

1316
01:21:50,746 --> 01:21:52,081
a serious problem.

1317
01:21:52,373 --> 01:21:53,916
Something Sonia Bern
kept in the bank

1318
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,751
that was robbed
over the weekend.

1319
01:21:56,043 --> 01:21:58,170
She is concerned that
her safe deposit box

1320
01:21:58,337 --> 01:21:59,672
may have been plundered.

1321
01:21:59,797 --> 01:22:02,591
I'm afraid her fears
are well justified.

1322
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:05,219
Oh my God.

1323
01:22:05,636 --> 01:22:09,098
I really thought Sonia was a woman
of more discreet character.

1324
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:13,477
So.. The genie is out
of the bottle then.

1325
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:16,063
- For both of us, ey?
- Not quite yet.

1326
01:22:16,272 --> 01:22:18,691
My operatives tell
me that the thieves

1327
01:22:18,858 --> 01:22:22,027
are using the photographs
as a bargaining chip.

1328
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:24,697
- Then give them what they want.
- Already in motion.

1329
01:22:24,864 --> 01:22:26,282
And the committee
having done the works

1330
01:22:26,448 --> 01:22:28,784
to issue a "D-notice"
on the whole business.

1331
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:32,788
To muffle the press.
Put a lid on it.

1332
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:13,078
Big pity, wouldn't it?

1333
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:16,665
Well, if your mates abandoned
you over a few photographs.

1334
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:24,173
Hello.

1335
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,385
You listen to me, Mr. "Vogel" or
whatever your fucking name is.

1336
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:30,679
You go ahead and kill him,
see if we give a shit.

1337
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,389
We got our loot.

1338
01:23:32,473 --> 01:23:34,058
Your ledgers and your photos,

1339
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:35,601
you can pick 'em up
from Scotland Yard.

1340
01:23:35,726 --> 01:23:36,685
We're sending them over.

1341
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:38,145
Don't do that.

1342
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:40,898
Well, if you want your
book of payoffs back,

1343
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:44,652
be at Paddington Station in person
tomorrow 11 am, platform 1.

1344
01:23:44,944 --> 01:23:48,197
There's a newsstand near
the statue of the soldier.

1345
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,491
Have Eddie with you,
hale and hearty.

1346
01:23:50,866 --> 01:23:52,952
This is your one and
only chance, Vogel.

1347
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:54,829
Don't blow it.

1348
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,348
Don't answer it! Catherine!

1349
01:24:14,473 --> 01:24:16,308
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1350
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:18,018
Come here.

1351
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:21,981
Here. Look, I got you a present.

1352
01:24:22,565 --> 01:24:25,526
- You been good for mommy?
- Yeah.

1353
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:31,407
I need to talk to mommy
about something,

1354
01:24:31,574 --> 01:24:32,992
so give us a minute, okay?

1355
01:24:33,075 --> 01:24:35,077
- Go on.
- Good girls.

1356
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:48,340
So.. you want to tell me
what's been going on?

1357
01:24:49,175 --> 01:24:52,595
- Some blokes worked over Dave.
- How bad?

1358
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:55,222
He's dead.

1359
01:24:56,015 --> 01:24:58,058
Oh my God Almighty, Terry.

1360
01:24:58,142 --> 01:24:59,894
What have you done to us?

1361
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:03,731
Wendy, I promise, I'm
gonna work this out.

1362
01:25:03,856 --> 01:25:05,524
And when I do, we're
going to leave England.

1363
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:07,401
And it's all going
to change for us.

1364
01:25:09,236 --> 01:25:10,863
But if anything goes
wrong, use this.

1365
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:13,991
There is plenty of cash.
Pounds, francs, dollars.

1366
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:15,618
You're going to
leave the country,

1367
01:25:15,784 --> 01:25:17,286
start a new life for
you and the girls.

1368
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,581
You can do this if you have to, Wendy.
Promise me.

1369
01:25:20,664 --> 01:25:22,291
Is that from the robbery, is it?

1370
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:25,669
My share, yeah.

1371
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:28,255
The papers said there was
a woman in the vault.

1372
01:25:28,672 --> 01:25:30,758
Martine, so was she involved?

1373
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,760
Yeah. She brought us the
job in the first place.

1374
01:25:32,885 --> 01:25:34,720
Oh, and did you sleep
with her, Terry?

1375
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,607
I did know that from day one.
It was the way she looked.

1376
01:25:46,732 --> 01:25:48,776
The first day we met I said
to my friend Audrey, I said:

1377
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:52,905
"I am gonna marry him. And
I am gonna have his kids."

1378
01:25:53,072 --> 01:25:57,952
And I have stuck by you.. I
stuck by you no matter what!

1379
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,745
You bastard!

1380
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:04,542
Fuck..

1381
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:13,634
You can throw me over.

1382
01:26:15,302 --> 01:26:17,012
I deserve it.

1383
01:26:18,514 --> 01:26:20,224
I brought you more
grief than happiness,

1384
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:24,270
but I love you. And the kids.

1385
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:29,525
So the reason I did this was to get
us out of this life once and for all.

1386
01:26:30,025 --> 01:26:31,610
<i>Mommy, open the door.</i>

1387
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:36,323
<i>Mommy, mommy!</i>

1388
01:26:36,448 --> 01:26:38,617
- We have the rest of our lives,
- Go play in your room!

1389
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,998
If you'll still have me.

1390
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:09,482
She takes a good
picture, eh, Tim?

1391
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,358
Lord Mountbatten has
graciously agreed to represent

1392
01:27:11,525 --> 01:27:13,194
the interest of the
crown in this matter.

1393
01:27:13,277 --> 01:27:15,988
- Is he high enough up the tree?
- Lord Mountbatten.

1394
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:17,990
I always wanted to
meet that bugger.

1395
01:27:18,115 --> 01:27:19,909
Yes. I am not sure he will be
very pleased to meet you, too.

1396
01:27:20,075 --> 01:27:23,162
He has to be under the main clock
Paddington Station, 11 am, or no deal.

1397
01:27:23,245 --> 01:27:24,371
11 am, on the knock,

1398
01:27:24,455 --> 01:27:26,165
and with your new
passports and documents.

1399
01:27:26,248 --> 01:27:28,375
He's gonna hand them over as
soon as he sees the photos.

1400
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:30,127
There's another problem.

1401
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:32,004
This robbery's pissed off
some local villains.

1402
01:27:32,296 --> 01:27:34,131
The guts come with
the glory, eh?

1403
01:27:34,507 --> 01:27:36,091
One of our mates
has been killed.

1404
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,511
That's hardly surprising considering
the roster of reprobates

1405
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:40,596
that are the banks'
deposit box customers.

1406
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:42,348
Listen, Terry. Our
committment is for..

1407
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:44,433
the recovery of the royal..
portraits only.

1408
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:48,062
The proceeds and the piss-offs
are both yours to deal with.

1409
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:54,151
11 am, Paddington Station.

1410
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:07,373
Gale.

1411
01:28:07,706 --> 01:28:09,500
Michael wants to see
you in the garden.

1412
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,294
- What for?
- I don't know.

1413
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,136
Gale, come. Come
and look at this.

1414
01:28:20,761 --> 01:28:21,762
Come.

1415
01:28:23,722 --> 01:28:26,725
- I want to show you something.
- What's this for?

1416
01:28:29,145 --> 01:28:30,563
It's for you.

1417
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:32,690
What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?

1418
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:34,859
You're a spy, sent
to steal from me.

1419
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:38,779
And nobody steals from Michael X.
No-one!

1420
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,869
See if it mentions the
copper in charge.

1421
01:28:47,663 --> 01:28:48,539
Here it is.

1422
01:28:48,706 --> 01:28:50,457
"Heading the case is
Detective Sergeant"

1423
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:52,585
"Roy Given of Marylebone
Lane police station."

1424
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,172
Roy Given?

1425
01:28:56,255 --> 01:28:58,132
No Roy Given menioned.

1426
01:28:58,924 --> 01:29:00,509
Let's hope that means
he's straight.

1427
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:03,220
And that he'd be interested in
the names of some bent coppers.

1428
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:05,181
Yeah, a bit of a long shot.

1429
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:08,934
Fuck it..

1430
01:29:09,101 --> 01:29:10,769
- Nothing in that one?
- No.

1431
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:16,484
What, we don't rate a mention.
Strike you as strange?

1432
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:17,985
It's kind of scary actually.

1433
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:20,446
If that news could
disappear, so could we.

1434
01:29:21,572 --> 01:29:23,365
<i>Next stop: Edgware Road.</i>

1435
01:29:23,908 --> 01:29:24,783
Well..

1436
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,202
Here's to us.

1437
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:30,456
See you, mate.

1438
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,375
Look after yourself. Take care.

1439
01:29:34,752 --> 01:29:36,086
Good luck, Kev.

1440
01:29:45,095 --> 01:29:48,474
So where are you headed? If
everything goes to plan?

1441
01:29:50,476 --> 01:29:52,895
I'll tell you, if
you're coming with me.

1442
01:30:09,995 --> 01:30:12,414
Good morning. I'm looking
for a Mr. Roy Given.

1443
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:13,999
It's very important.

1444
01:30:14,124 --> 01:30:15,793
- Roy Given?
- Yeah.

1445
01:30:17,336 --> 01:30:19,255
Can I ask what it's concerning?

1446
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,423
No, I prefer to tell him myself.

1447
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,092
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you're interested

1448
01:30:23,259 --> 01:30:24,760
in the rest of this
book of payoffs,

1449
01:30:24,844 --> 01:30:26,512
the author's gonna be
at Paddington Station

1450
01:30:26,637 --> 01:30:28,180
11 am, platform one.

1451
01:30:28,305 --> 01:30:30,975
And how exactly did this
come into your possession?

1452
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:34,478
<i>Next stop: Paddington Station.
Change here for the Bakerloo line.</i>

1453
01:30:34,854 --> 01:30:37,314
Let's hope now he turns
up fashionably late.

1454
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:54,623
- There's your friend, Tim.
- Good luck.

1455
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:08,846
It's good to see
you in one piece.

1456
01:31:09,221 --> 01:31:12,016
You were worried for your own
arse, Tim, not for mine.

1457
01:31:20,816 --> 01:31:22,067
You're a prick, Tim.

1458
01:31:22,151 --> 01:31:24,111
You set this whole thing up
from the start, didn't you?

1459
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,197
Come on, you get to be
rich, free and clear.

1460
01:31:26,322 --> 01:31:27,823
Isn't that what you wanted?

1461
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,973
- You stay here with the car.
- Right.

1462
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,353
Bloody kidney stone.
It's gotta go out soon.

1463
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,817
I haven't had this much
excitement since the war.

1464
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:46,527
We're a little late, My Lord.

1465
01:32:57,037 --> 01:32:58,372
So where is your mate?

1466
01:32:58,455 --> 01:33:00,791
There, sir, that one
at the newsstand.

1467
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,675
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys
before at the girl's flat.

1468
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:11,510
- It's a trap, they're MI-5.
- Terry.

1469
01:33:11,802 --> 01:33:12,803
<i>Terry.</i>

1470
01:33:22,313 --> 01:33:23,814
- Lord Mountbatten?
- Yes?

1471
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:26,525
You know the arrangements and
you agree to our new identities

1472
01:33:26,609 --> 01:33:28,068
and immunity from prosecution?

1473
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,613
You have my word that the crown
will honour this committment.

1474
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:33,532
Your documentation
and guarantees

1475
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,454
If I were you, I'd keep
them in a very safe place.

1476
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,998
Yeah, well, you bet it won't
be a safe deposit box.

1477
01:33:49,548 --> 01:33:53,219
She is a scallywag. Thank you.

1478
01:33:58,057 --> 01:33:59,058
Martine.

1479
01:33:59,975 --> 01:34:01,602
It wasn't all business for me.

1480
01:34:06,106 --> 01:34:08,400
- What happened, where's the book?
- Just open the door.

1481
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,069
- No! Get in there.

1482
01:34:10,194 --> 01:34:11,695
Stay there, or you're dead meat!

1483
01:34:16,075 --> 01:34:17,785
Where are you
going, old man, eh?

1484
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:18,911
No!

1485
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:22,873
- This one's for Dave.
- No..

1486
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:24,708
You fucker!

1487
01:34:27,044 --> 01:34:29,463
Not so fucking smug now, are ya?

1488
01:34:35,386 --> 01:34:36,846
Oi, you punk!

1489
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:15,342
- Eddie, get out.
- That's the one that killed Dave.

1490
01:35:15,468 --> 01:35:16,635
Get your hands off me!

1491
01:35:17,553 --> 01:35:19,388
Arrest them, they
are bank robbers.

1492
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:21,849
- Fuck!
- This bloke killed our friend!

1493
01:35:21,932 --> 01:35:23,350
- Shit.
- No, no, listen..

1494
01:35:33,652 --> 01:35:35,863
So, are we seriously
arseholed now, Terry?

1495
01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:38,532
Well, at least we're not
dead like poor old Dave.

1496
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,038
Get up, you filthy bastard.

1497
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:46,248
You're under arrest.
Take him away.

1498
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:47,750
<i>All right. Come on, you.</i>

1499
01:35:48,584 --> 01:35:49,752
<i>Get in the car.</i>

1500
01:35:55,841 --> 01:35:57,259
It's all right, mate.

1501
01:36:05,142 --> 01:36:06,727
I wonder if that's Roy Given?

1502
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:11,357
Who's he?

1503
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:14,235
I was hoping he was
a straight copper.

1504
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:17,196
We've got a nice
collar here, Roy.

1505
01:36:17,321 --> 01:36:19,698
You know, these two are part of the
Baker Street bank robbery gang.

1506
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:21,992
- Place this man under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1507
01:36:22,117 --> 01:36:24,411
What are you talking about? They're
part of the Baker Street Firm.

1508
01:36:24,495 --> 01:36:25,454
I don't know about that.

1509
01:36:25,538 --> 01:36:27,706
But I know all about you,
you corrupt bastard.

1510
01:36:27,832 --> 01:36:29,834
Cuff him. The one over
by the wall as well.

1511
01:36:30,209 --> 01:36:31,544
But they're the robbers!

1512
01:36:33,504 --> 01:36:34,755
No robbers in here.

1513
01:36:34,839 --> 01:36:35,840
<i>Watch your head.</i>

1514
01:36:36,966 --> 01:36:37,550
Now..

1515
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:41,011
I believe you've a certain
Mr. Vogel's book of shame.

1516
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,098
Well, if you let me out,
I'll go get it for you.

1517
01:36:47,393 --> 01:36:48,978
That belongs to me.

1518
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:56,735
Here's your book.

1519
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:58,821
Terry. We were thinking,
a smart fella like you

1520
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:01,657
might have kept mementos of
the event, just in case.

1521
01:37:01,782 --> 01:37:04,243
Case what? Things didn't
turn out so nicely?

1522
01:37:04,368 --> 01:37:06,162
If they should ever
see the light of day

1523
01:37:06,328 --> 01:37:08,122
don't think we can't find you.

1524
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:17,131
Out. Go on, piss off.

1525
01:37:18,048 --> 01:37:19,467
Aren't you gone?

1526
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:22,636
- How did that happen?
- Fucked if I know, just keep walking.

1527
01:37:32,605 --> 01:37:33,939
Michael, Michael!

1528
01:37:38,527 --> 01:37:41,363
What's going on? What do
you want in my place?

1529
01:37:41,447 --> 01:37:42,573
What do you want?

1530
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,617
- We are placing you under arrest.
- What am I charged with?

1531
01:37:44,742 --> 01:37:48,120
Conspiracy to import drugs into
the United Kingdom, will that do?

1532
01:37:48,204 --> 01:37:49,788
But you could still
help yourself.

1533
01:37:50,372 --> 01:37:53,626
There's a British national staying
with you, a certain Gale Benson.

1534
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:55,419
She was here, but she's gone on.

1535
01:37:59,799 --> 01:38:01,801
<i>- All right.
- Get in the back!</i>

1536
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,978
Over here, sir.

1537
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:32,331
Burn the house down.

1538
01:38:32,456 --> 01:38:34,375
I want nothing of this
place left standing.

1539
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,645
- Were you friends of Dave?
- Oh yeah.

1540
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,229
- Really?

1541
01:38:55,354 --> 01:38:57,481
We knew him in a
professional capacity.

1542
01:38:58,315 --> 01:39:00,484
He was one of our favourites.

1543
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:02,069
See you later.

1544
01:39:03,362 --> 01:39:05,364
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1545
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:07,825
So where are you off to, Kevin?

1546
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,285
Anywhere you want to go.

1547
01:39:10,369 --> 01:39:12,496
Sorry, I'm doing a
solo from now on.

1548
01:39:12,872 --> 01:39:13,831
Yeah, well.

1549
01:39:13,956 --> 01:39:15,166
It was worth a try.

1550
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,418
Do you want another one?

1551
01:39:17,585 --> 01:39:19,879
Yeah, go on. One for the road.

1552
01:39:20,963 --> 01:39:22,965
Tummy.

1553
01:39:24,717 --> 01:39:26,469
I just wish Dave could
have seen all this.

1554
01:39:26,594 --> 01:39:28,387
Yeah.. Here's to Dave.

1555
01:39:28,888 --> 01:39:30,097
To Dave.

1556
01:39:37,062 --> 01:39:38,564
What do you want, Martine?

1557
01:39:39,565 --> 01:39:41,609
I'm sorry I've caused
you this upset, Wendy.

1558
01:39:41,984 --> 01:39:43,861
Well, apparently we're rich.

1559
01:39:46,197 --> 01:39:49,658
I know the business is finished,
but are the cars really ours?

1560
01:39:52,369 --> 01:39:53,412
Yeah.

1561
01:39:55,706 --> 01:39:57,208
They are all yours.

1562
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:00,419
Jessul has been paid off.

1563
01:40:01,587 --> 01:40:02,922
I won't lie to you..

1564
01:40:03,756 --> 01:40:05,257
I would have gone with him,

1565
01:40:05,382 --> 01:40:07,760
and I would have shut
you out of my mind,

1566
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:10,930
but he didn't want to know.

1567
01:40:16,101 --> 01:40:17,478
I'm sorry.

1568
01:40:19,772 --> 01:40:22,983
- Your wife is talking to Martine.
- I know, Kev.

1569
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:24,485
I know..

1570
01:40:27,613 --> 01:40:28,823
Good luck.

1571
01:40:43,712 --> 01:40:45,297
It was always you, Terry.

1572
01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:14,243
Daddy!

1573
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,119
Hey!

1574
01:41:15,703 --> 01:41:17,329
Oh my God, Terry,
that's a big one.

1575
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:19,456
Last a few chips though, innit?

1576
01:41:19,582 --> 01:41:21,667
<i>- Don't, mom!</i>

1577
01:41:29,925 --> 01:41:31,969
- Fish fingers tonight, eh?
- What a pretty boy..

1578
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:32,597
