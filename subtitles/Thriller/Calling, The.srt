The Calling (2014)

3
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:54,895
Hey, Dale.

4
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,578
-Good morning, Hazel.
-How we doing?

5
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,463
I'm great. There you go.
Extra bacon today, okay?

6
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,535
-Great.
-Here you go.

7
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,615
Thanks so much.

8
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,822
Hey, you know,
I hate to bother you with this,

9
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:04,817
but there's more of those
cross-country ski tracks.

10
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:07,101
-They go right through my property.
-Yeah. Well, winter's almost over.

11
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,654
-I know that, but can you stop...
-Yeah, yeah, I will. Okay.

12
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:11,020
Thank you.

13
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:39,262
-What?
-I need to talk to you.

14
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:43,385
I'm eating. Can't you see I'm eating?
Hang on.

15
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:46,697
-Okay, I'll wait for you inside.
-Okay.

16
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,782
Here. So what's up?
Could you take that, please?

17
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,426
Yeah. Bob Chandler has been trying
to reach his mother all morning.

18
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,575
She's not answering.

19
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,736
-And?
-Well, he's getting back this afternoon.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,136
Jolene stopped by and knocked on the door.
No answer.

21
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,217
-So, he's hoping that you'll pass by...
-Good morning.

22
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,898
...make sure that Delia's okay.

23
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,101
And why can't you do it?

24
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,575
Because my shift ended while
you were eating your breakfast.

25
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,145
All right.

26
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,574
Let me take care of that for you.

27
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,543
Thanks. Yeah, just top it up?

28
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,304
The cell phone.

29
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,456
No, it's fine.

30
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,021
It's been sitting in that box
for three months.

31
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,903
It's comfortable there.

32
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,897
-Get some sleep.
-Will you stop by Ernie's on the way?

33
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,863
There was a call about
some sort of fracas over there.

34
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:39,983
-A "fracas"?
-That's what I said, "fracas."

35
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,699
"Fracas." I think it's...

36
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,975
-Try Delia again.
-Okay.

37
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:26,737
Delia, it's Hazel.
I'm letting myself in.

38
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:30,375
Delia?

39
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:16,899
Yeah, I'm at Delia's.
Get over here as fast as you can,

40
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:20,183
and call Spere. Yeah.

41
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:32,978
You got here fast.

42
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,578
This is wild.

43
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,985
Yeah.

44
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,140
You knew her?

45
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,103
Yeah. All my life.

46
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,459
She went to my mom's church.

47
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,705
I've never seen anything like this.

48
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,383
What can you tell?

49
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,377
Well, it looks like a knife
to the neck.

50
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,941
Yeah.

51
00:07:56,026 --> 00:08:00,019
But I'll have to bring her to the city
and get a full report from the coroner.

52
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,381
-It could take a couple of weeks.
-I can't wait two weeks.

53
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,855
Do me a favour,
take her to the church first.

54
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,937
I'll meet you there
and you can see what you figure out

55
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:09,176
and then take her to Mayfair Grace
for the autopsy.

56
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,699
I can't do that. Protocol.

57
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:13,254
I know what the protocols are.

58
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,015
I guess so. Sure. She's your friend.

59
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,778
Thanks. I appreciate it.

60
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,302
Tommy, if you're gonna puke,
don't do it here.

61
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,536
-No, I'm okay.
-You sure?

62
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,016
Maybe I better go outside
and wait for Bob to get here.

63
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:48,097
-Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
-Yeah.

64
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,094
You okay?

65
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,736
Yeah, I'm okay. You okay?

66
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,060
Yeah.

67
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,025
<i>What about cars?</i>

68
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:24,223
Were there any cars around
that you didn't recognise?

69
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, there were cars.

70
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,226
I mean, that you didn't know,
that you hadn't seen before?

71
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,378
Yesterday, parked over there,
there was one.

72
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,785
A dark one.

73
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,143
-Black?
-Like, dark grey.

74
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,342
Grey. Okay.
And did you see the driver?

75
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:38,735
No.

76
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,259
How about the make?

77
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,417
Maybe Ronny will remember.
He knows cars.

78
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,464
If Ronny does figure out anything,
would you have him call me?

79
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,535
Yeah.

80
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,939
She's getting big.

81
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,825
Oh, God.

82
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,617
I'll get this.
I'll take him in the back.

83
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:02,934
Thanks.

84
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:15,896
I've been trying for months
to get her into hospice care.

85
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,339
I knew this day was coming

86
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,736
and I just never figured
it was going to be like this.

87
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:25,461
So, did she have any family heirlooms

88
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,106
or expensive jewellery
or anything in the house?

89
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:30,063
-You think someone was trying to rob her?
-I don't know.

90
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:35,017
Was she expecting anyone,
I mean, besides you?

91
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,265
No.

92
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,498
Can I see her?

93
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,060
Not yet. Let's...

94
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,105
In a bit.

95
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,299
So, as you can see,
this cut is surgical.

96
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:03,981
Through the windpipe and oesophagus
on the first cut.

97
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,502
And the second deepens all the way
down to the spinal cord.

98
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:10,302
Was he trying to get a trophy?

99
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,776
Well, another cut and it was his.
So, I'd say no.

100
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,304
What happened to the finger?

101
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,775
He broke it before she died.

102
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:21,585
You can see the swelling.
That's definitely before.

103
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,497
So she did fight back.

104
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:26,905
It would be the only sign.
Didn't see anything else.

105
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:30,463
Her face looked like
she was screaming when she died.

106
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:34,221
That's a horror movie myth,
faces frozen in terror.

107
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,344
Mostly the dead look drunk.

108
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,144
This was clearly manipulated.

109
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:42,785
You have to wait until rigor mortis
sets in, about three hours.

110
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,983
And then, you have to hold
the mouth and tongue in that position

111
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,579
until the muscle sets.

112
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,259
For how long?

113
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,498
I'd say another hour.

114
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:55,103
He was standing over her
with his fingers in her mouth.

115
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:02,023
When I was a taxidermist I actually
tried it on this tabby cat, and I...

116
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,655
<i>We're not equipped for this,</i>

117
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,655
and you are in no shape
to be chasing anyone.

118
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:11,385
That leaves me. This is something
I can't handle on my own.

119
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,696
What, are you complaining about this
before we even give it a try?

120
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,697
We need to get Mason to
assign a homicide detective.

121
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,254
We are detectives. This is our town.
We can do this.

122
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,620
Don't let your personal shit
cloud your judgement.

123
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,185
-What are you talking about?
-Your words. Your words.

124
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,619
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

125
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:26,335
I don't understand. All I have to say is
I'm gonna do this with or without you.

126
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,860
So if I have to, I'll do it alone.

127
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,224
Fuck you, Hazel.

128
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,943
Thanks. I knew you'd get onboard.

129
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,025
What?

130
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,584
I don't think you get this good
on the first try.

131
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:09,305
Over here.

132
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,463
Move back. Give her some space.

133
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,303
I heard about Delia.

134
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,704
That was fast. Who told you?

135
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:32,060
Trudy Davis.

136
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,898
Everybody's over at the church.

137
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,977
Why aren't you there?

138
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,864
'Cause I wanted to be here
when you got home.

139
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:41,062
Well, I'm home, so you can go.

140
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,902
You know,
it would mean a lot to everybody if...

141
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:48,740
Please, do not start with
your Sundays of sunshine shit.

142
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,098
You can knock it all you want,

143
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,420
but when you were in the hospital,
they were there for you.

144
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,144
I didn't ask them to be there for me.

145
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:59,741
It was my back, and they made it
into some kind of community tragedy.

146
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,018
It wasn't just your back.
You were about to have a baby.

147
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,259
Well, that was a long time ago.

148
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,577
And I can count on one hand the number
of times you've talked about it.

149
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,419
All right, look,
I will go to the funeral. Okay?

150
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,415
What do you want to eat?

151
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,778
Nothing. I'm going out.

152
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,777
-With who?
-With Andy.

153
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,585
Will his wife be there?

154
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,143
I hope so.

155
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,458
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

156
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,377
I was starving. I went ahead.

157
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,260
-I got you a drink.
-Thanks.

158
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,294
What's going on? You okay?

159
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:00,819
It's this back.

160
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:04,660
I gotta have an operation for the,
you know, disc thing.

161
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:06,657
Again? What about the shots?

162
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,778
They're not working.

163
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,300
One doctor says it's autoimmune.

164
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,297
The other one says
it was the original operation.

165
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,421
I don't know.

166
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,895
-When do they want you to have it?
-Six months ago.

167
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,658
Hazel.

168
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,661
I mean,
your stubbornness is gonna kill you.

169
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,464
There's worse ways to go.

170
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,664
Listen, there's a great rehabilitation
facility. It's in North Bay.

171
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,464
Are you crazy?
I'm not leaving my house.

172
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,343
Your mom can't carry you.

173
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:33,541
I'd like to see her try.

174
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:41,945
Maybe I can help some. I could come
over maybe once or twice a day.

175
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:46,298
What would your wife say?

176
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:48,821
My wife?

177
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,104
My wife would say that you're having
surgery to get me under your roof again.

178
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,905
She's a riot.

179
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,385
Here you go, Hazel.

180
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,138
You two seem to be in sync.

181
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:07,545
You jealous?

182
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,305
You gotta go.

183
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:19,819
No, I should go.

184
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,814
I should go, Hazel.

185
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,856
I'll get you next time.

186
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,335
Wait. I mean, while I have you here,

187
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:32,859
I just thought maybe
you could help me with this.

188
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:35,540
This asshole cop got me
on the way back from hockey.

189
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,900
Sure.

190
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,015
Okay, thanks.

191
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,700
Okay.

192
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,982
We don't open for a couple of minutes,
but come on in.

193
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:28,864
It's cold.

194
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:33,382
Have a seat wherever you like.
Coffee's brewing.

195
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:43,300
Some hot water, if you have.

196
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,541
That one of those green teas?

197
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:03,061
It's damiana, natural tonic.

198
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:11,660
Get a lot of truckers this time of the morning,
but you don't look like a trucker.

199
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:14,499
I'm not.

200
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,902
Well, cook should be here any minute
if you want to see a menu.

201
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:24,739
Just berries, if you have.

202
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,025
Yeah.

203
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:45,262
Sorry, it comes with melon.

204
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:57,824
Are you a doctor?

205
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,818
I specialise

206
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:10,181
in methods that
conventional medicine ignores.

207
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,618
What kind of methods?

208
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:19,223
Many diseases can manifest
through our environment.

209
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,615
What we eat, how we live,

210
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,945
and just as we may create our illness,

211
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,697
our bodies can be healed.

212
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,942
And that works on...

213
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,624
On sick people?

214
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,982
If they are pure of heart
and mind, yes.

215
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:52,106
My daughter Rose is...

216
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,380
She's sick.

217
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:57,061
They call them seizures,
but it's like she falls over dead.

218
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,343
They think it's a brain tumour.

219
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:01,975
How old is she?

220
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:04,744
She's 12.

221
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:11,817
"And straightway,
the damsel arose and walked,

222
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,022
"for she was of the age of 12.

223
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:18,219
"And they were overcome with wonder."

224
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,940
Mark 5:42.

225
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,575
Excuse me.

226
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,260
Pretty good month.

227
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:05,424
What are they talking about in there?

228
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,218
Something about an Oldsmobile.

229
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,735
-I'm just gonna leave those there.
-Yeah, okay.

230
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,303
So are you liking it here so far?

231
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,776
Yeah, it's great.

232
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,654
You know, if you need any help finding
an apartment, I know lots of places.

233
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,577
I'm good. Thank you.

234
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:26,660
Okay.

235
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,582
-Stop flirting and get him in here.
-She...

236
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:37,136
So I found three late '80s Olds
in the system.

237
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,262
One's on cinder blocks,
the other two are accounted for.

238
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:40,461
So that means that the one Jolene saw...

239
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,423
-Didn't come from here.
-Right.

240
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:45,983
-This is Ben Wingate.
-Good morning.

241
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,263
Good morning, Mr Wingate.
And where did they find you?

242
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,859
Toronto. 52 Division.

243
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,016
You transferred from Toronto to here?

244
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:54,541
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,498
Whose wife did you screw?

246
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,306
-It was my choice.
-Why?

247
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:08,024
I thought it was nice.

248
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,540
-It's not nice.
-No, it's not nice at all.

249
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:12,457
But it is interesting, isn't it,

250
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:15,219
that he shows up

251
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:18,696
when we have our first murder
in four years?

252
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,940
Is that that?

253
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:25,744
No, I didn't set that ring.

254
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,498
And how do you answer it?

255
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,304
Just press the button. That... Yeah.

256
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:30,978
Stop. Shut up. How do you do that?

257
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,101
The bottom one.

258
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,699
Shit, I broke it.

259
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,740
Give me that.

260
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,024
I will fix this.

261
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:43,379
Dismissed.

262
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,906
<i>My mother lived her whole life</i>
<i>in this town.</i>

263
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,615
She was one of the original members
of Civitan Zone 5.

264
00:22:57,506 --> 00:23:01,385
Every year, and I can remember,
she would put on her best dress,

265
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,219
go out
and sell Claxton cakes at Christmas.

266
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:08,142
She once told me that
if I speak at her funeral,

267
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,581
to make sure everyone here remember her

268
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,941
how she was before the sick.

269
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:17,736
The Delia Chandler who had great gams
and could kick over her head.

270
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:22,096
And who loved her family
and her community.

271
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:35,895
Oh, God, here she comes.

272
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:37,214
-Andrew.
-Hey.

273
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,342
-Glynnis.
-Hey, Hazel.

274
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,894
I know you call him Andy.

275
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,454
I'm just trying to be respectful.

276
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:48,141
Well, I call him Andrew. You can
call him whatever the hell you want.

277
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:52,458
But if you want to be respectful,
stop parking your car outside our house.

278
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,616
-Excuse me, but some people have jobs.
-Ray, could you...

279
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:56,981
My job happens to be
to take care of this community.

280
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,500
-What is your job? Because... At the bar?
-You and Andrew happen to...

281
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,019
Why don't you go down the way?

282
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,256
Why don't you go there for a while?

283
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:06,065
I feel bad for Andy. I really,
I want him to be happy, I just...

284
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,865
-Hey, we got a dead body out in Chamberlain.
-What does he see in her anyway?

285
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,265
I mean, really. What did you say?

286
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:13,577
Dead body out in Chamberlain.
Potential homicide.

287
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,985
That's not us.

288
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,500
Well, Mason wants us to
go out there, so it is now.

289
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:19,942
He called you and not me?

290
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,019
-Body in there?
-Yeah.

291
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,380
Victim's name?

292
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,905
Michael Ullman.

293
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,102
The horse trainer found him
this morning.

294
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:50,539
She had the week off.

295
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:52,742
Okay. I'd like to talk to her.

296
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,539
I don't know where she is.
I told her that she could leave, I...

297
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,617
All right, relax.
Do you know where she lives?

298
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:01,821
Do you have her phone number?

299
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,454
Okay, I'd like you to call her,

300
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,696
ask her if she's seen
an old make Oldsmobile,

301
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:09,858
grey, maybe between '85, '89.

302
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:12,735
You can do that now.

303
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:15,100
-Yeah.
-Good.

304
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:16,255
Go.

305
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:05,385
What is it?

306
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,181
No stomach.

307
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,658
What do you mean there's no stomach?

308
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:17,625
It's been removed.

309
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:33,581
Hazel?

310
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:57,298
What is it?

311
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,896
I think I found his stomach.

312
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,977
Two murders in three days,

313
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,897
couple of 100 klicks apart.

314
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,261
Something's in the air. Full moon?

315
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,898
You think he's smart enough
to know our jurisdiction lines?

316
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:30,297
-You think this is connected to Delia?
-Well, it's...

317
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:34,541
A gruesome crime scene.
No forced entry.

318
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:36,457
I don't think so.

319
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:38,855
I mean, the victims couldn't be
more different.

320
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:42,855
An old lady in town.
Rich guy on a farm.

321
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:44,538
What's the connection?

322
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:47,096
His face looked pretty weird,
didn't it?

323
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:53,264
It could have been manipulated
but it wasn't so obvious.

324
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:55,302
Would it show up in the autopsy?

325
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,581
Not if he was wearing gloves.
Thank you.

326
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,700
You guys?

327
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,739
All right.

328
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:39,815
Don't put your drink
on my photo album.

329
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,783
You're gonna get a mark on it.

330
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,860
I haven't looked at these
in a long time.

331
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:53,264
Look at those false eyelashes.
Remember those?

332
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,018
Yeah, they were ridiculous.

333
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,495
Remember at your wedding
when you started laughing

334
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:58,939
and you laughed so hard you cried

335
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:01,665
and your eyelashes
slid down your cheek?

336
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:04,306
I'm not the one that
started the laughing, you did.

337
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:08,220
No, I didn't. No. I was laughing
because you were laughing.

338
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:09,978
Once you started I had to join in.

339
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:15,580
You have such an infectious laugh.

340
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,544
You have a terrible memory.

341
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,981
I don't have a terrible memory.
That's exactly what happened.

342
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,578
I miss that laugh.

343
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,822
Okay. Well, enjoy your corpses.

344
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:46,659
Thank you. I was just calling to see

345
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,544
if there'd been any recent murders
in your jurisdiction.

346
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,785
Sure, I can hold.

347
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:54,025
Who is that?

348
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:55,937
Hamilton Police Department.

349
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:58,901
They're not sure they've had
any murders?

350
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:01,464
Yeah, I'm still here.

351
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:09,504
Got your requisition
for more manpower.

352
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:11,417
Didn't I send somebody to you?

353
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,464
Yes, but we still only have
two detectives, me and Ray.

354
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,184
Well, that should be enough
to solve one murder.

355
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,255
Two.

356
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:20,383
-We think this is the work of a...
-Oh, good God.

357
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,585
No, please.

358
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:25,660
Serial killer.

359
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,020
Serial killer?

360
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,017
Do you know what we call
two murders here?

361
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:30,300
The morning shift.

362
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,344
You should do stand-up.

363
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,697
Wait a second.
This is your way of convincing me

364
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,458
to give you the permanent
Commanding Officer job,

365
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,696
with a suicide attempt on your record.

366
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:45,057
You lost your chance when they had to pump
painkillers out of your belly in the ER.

367
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:52,740
I'm telling you about two murders.
Do you think I give a shit what my title is?

368
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:55,738
You would have been forced into retirement
without me, so watch your mouth.

369
00:30:58,506 --> 00:30:59,495
All right.

370
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:02,862
Hazel, you want my attention,
you got it. What do you have?

371
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:05,975
Look.

372
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:10,935
You see how her mouth was manipulated?
We think his was, too.

373
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,017
And there was no forced entry
in either case,

374
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:17,258
and Ullman's body was just a few miles
over the jurisdictional line.

375
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:18,941
And?

376
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:21,256
Well, so he's spreading his targets
far enough apart

377
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,383
and he's changing the profile of the victims
so that we don't connect them.

378
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,742
Serial killers leave calling cards.

379
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:30,386
They want the world to know
what they're doing.

380
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,822
I'm telling you,
I know that this is the same guy.

381
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:34,895
You know nothing.

382
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:38,376
You are guessing and you want me to
give you manpower to follow a hunch.

383
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:41,742
All I need is one detective
with profiling experience.

384
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:44,545
You know, if I knew that sending you to
Chamberlain was going to trigger this,

385
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:46,264
I would have sent somebody
who was better equipped.

386
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:50,455
But, as I said,
I don't have anybody else.

387
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:58,657
No. No specific age or gender.

388
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,418
No, it could look like anything.

389
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,666
Yeah. Yeah, the mouth.

390
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,782
That's exactly what we're looking for.

391
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:10,538
No, it could look like a suicide.

392
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:15,455
Could you send that over to me?

393
00:33:00,986 --> 00:33:02,339
Is she upstairs?

394
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:04,454
She's sleeping.

395
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,899
I just...

396
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,175
I don't think now is a good time.

397
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,985
I'm sorry.

398
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:21,425
I understand.

399
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,419
Wait.

400
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:50,334
Can you open your mouth for me?

401
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,064
Stick out your tongue.

402
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,862
What happens just before
you fall down?

403
00:33:57,466 --> 00:34:00,026
-It smells funny.
-Like what?

404
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:02,579
Scrambled eggs.

405
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:06,098
Do you like scrambled eggs?

406
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,178
Not any more.

407
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,577
I don't like scrambled eggs either.

408
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:14,215
What is it?

409
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:16,945
This is mistletoe.

410
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,264
It's like Christmas.

411
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:26,096
This is my favourite part.

412
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:34,425
There.

413
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:40,817
I'm not drinking that.

414
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,578
Do you like honey?

415
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:48,700
Yeah.

416
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,143
Could you bring us some honey?

417
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,177
I'm going to die, aren't I?

418
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:10,625
Well, we're all going to die.
That's how God intended it.

419
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:14,937
But how we live and how we die,

420
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:17,823
that can be meaningful.

421
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,457
Do you want to get better?

422
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,224
I forgot to tell you.

423
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,858
These cups are magic.

424
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,983
If you sing to them,

425
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:49,136
they'll make the tea taste better.

426
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,059
Your turn.

427
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:08,544
Keep singing.

428
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:13,783
Keep singing.

429
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,021
I looked into that stuff
you asked about.

430
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,505
She had an email account.

431
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:32,259
Traded gardening tips
with a cousin in Calgary,

432
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,621
and she visited
a soap opera chat room.

433
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:36,345
She kept busy.

434
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,699
That she did.

435
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:43,505
The only thing she bought was
a gold cross necklace on overstock.com.

436
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:46,255
I don't remember her wearing necklaces.

437
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:48,497
It's my wife's birthday next week.

438
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:53,382
It's gonna be weird
getting something from her now.

439
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:00,941
She never said it out loud, but
she'd been suffering for a long time.

440
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,665
I could see she was ready to go.
It was in her eyes.

441
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:07,859
Maybe he did her a favour.

442
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:10,943
Doesn't make it right.

443
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:13,625
I know.

444
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,184
But it helps me sleep.

445
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:28,579
Wingate.

446
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,065
You're gonna want to see this.

447
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:31,864
Okay.

448
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,220
Maybe I should walk you through that.

449
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:35,501
-No, that's fine. Good night. Thank you.
-Okay, are you sure?

450
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,144
Do you like curry?

451
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:41,014
Yeah.

452
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,779
I love curry.

453
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:46,664
Well, Hazel, let the kid in.

454
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,741
I finally got all these files
I've been chasing down

455
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:59,294
and I think we're missing something
with the faces.

456
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:02,378
This is Gary Dewer, found by his son,
hanging from a chandelier.

457
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:04,741
Plastic bag over his head. Look at...

458
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,624
The tongue is pressed down
towards the teeth.

459
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:09,936
Four days later, Adrian Grunwald,

460
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:12,095
mouth found open.

461
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:15,656
And then we have Morton Halfe.

462
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,863
Look at this. His mouth
is almost identical to Dewer's.

463
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:21,583
-Like Ullman's.
-Yeah.

464
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:24,506
What's the connective...
You know, what are we missing?

465
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:26,617
All the mouths are clearly manipulated.

466
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,504
Is it like a code or something?

467
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,019
How's the curry?

468
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:32,375
It's great.

469
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:34,857
Thank you. It's delicious.

470
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,982
Glad to see
someone's eating my cooking.

471
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:44,018
So, why did you transfer
from Toronto to here, really?

472
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,859
I mean, don't give me the bullshit
about a small town life.

473
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:53,101
My partner died last year.

474
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:54,585
On duty?

475
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,179
He wasn't a cop.

476
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:04,664
The guys on the force
didn't take that news so well.

477
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:07,303
Well, how do you like it here so far?

478
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,937
Excuse me, I ask a lot of questions.

479
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:12,740
-It's an occupational hazard.
-No, that's okay.

480
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:15,101
-Are you a reporter?
-No.

481
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,700
Judge. Retired.

482
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,624
Well, then, Your Honour,

483
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,824
I like it.

484
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:27,137
I mean, it's slower.

485
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,535
But, I think that's good, you know.

486
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,743
It gives you kind of more time
to think.

487
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:34,179
Exactly.

488
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,181
You been calling your mother?

489
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,904
All right, stop it.

490
00:39:38,986 --> 00:39:41,102
What? Kids should talk
to their mothers.

491
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:42,414
And some mothers talk too much.

492
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:43,901
-Meaning me?
-Yes.

493
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:46,136
-Okay.
-You're my mother. You're talking too much.

494
00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:47,784
-I'm hardly talking at all.
-Okay.

495
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,094
-You're grilling him.
-I'm not!

496
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,938
I'll clear. I'll clear.

497
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,300
Next.

498
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,296
Looks like he's singing.

499
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,660
Next. What about this one?

500
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:07,863
The mouth's pressed together.
What if...

501
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,616
Seriously,
what if he's saying something?

502
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,664
-He's not saying something, he's dead.
-No.

503
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:20,741
-Well, is he saying anything?
-It's like a... Look, it's like a...

504
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,144
Buh, like a buh.

505
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,454
No, it's mmm...

506
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,497
Mmm, mmm. Muh.

507
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:29,216
-Well, go to the next one.
-The upper lip is bent. It's "buh."

508
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:31,376
-That's it, go on.
-But you bend your upper lip with a "muh."

509
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:32,785
Now do it again.

510
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:35,619
Say a sentence that has a "muh" sound
and a "buh" sound.

511
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:36,821
You're going to see the difference.

512
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:38,976
Your mother got hit by a bus.

513
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,581
Okay, yeah.
Do you see... "Your mother..."

514
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,896
"Muh" and "buh,"
they're two entirely...

515
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:44,975
Okay, try it again.

516
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,296
Okay, that's a mouth
that's wide open, right?

517
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:48,375
Go back.

518
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,661
If you look at it,
the lips are curled in. "Mmm."

519
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:53,180
You're right
if you're talking about Portuguese.

520
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,460
I don't speak Portuguese.

521
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:58,224
Or maybe it's not what
they're saying as individuals.

522
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:02,424
Maybe they're syllables
and whoever manipulated their mouths

523
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:05,543
is saying something with them all...
Will you be quiet!

524
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,259
Well, some of them don't look like
they're saying anything together.

525
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,859
Maybe it's in the wrong order, then.

526
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,459
Well,
it's the order that we found them.

527
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:16,740
Well, maybe it's a different order.

528
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:18,544
Maybe it's the order in
which they were killed.

529
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:21,379
How about if we try it
going from west to east?

530
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:25,061
So, that would be Dewer,
Grunwald, Fortnum. Try that.

531
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:26,340
Okay.

532
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:32,059
Faster.

533
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,782
The vowels?
Think about how many vowels.

534
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:38,380
Vowels make you open
your entire mouth.

535
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,422
I mean, think about it.
Something buh or muh,

536
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:42,861
it's slow but it's something like a...

537
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:45,545
Jesus.

538
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:08,102
Lie-bee-la.

539
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,935
Lie-bee-la. Lie-bee-la?

540
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:14,143
No, no, no, it's Lie-bee-ra.

541
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,778
It's an "R". Look at...
Look at his mouth.

542
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:20,221
That's an "L." Now can you flip
to Ruby Marshall, please?

543
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:23,742
Yeah. See how the tongue is
kind of on the side of the mouth?

544
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,659
That's an R. It's "ra."

545
00:42:26,746 --> 00:42:30,421
As in, "You're wrong."

546
00:42:32,026 --> 00:42:35,257
Lie-bee-ra-ri-e.

547
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:36,779
Lie-bee-ra-ri-e.

548
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:41,975
It's Professor Plume in the lie-bee-ra-ri-e
with the candlestick.

549
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:46,578
I'm done.

550
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:32,736
Hey, guys. What if it isn't English?

551
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,215
What do you mean, like French?

552
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:48,299
They were all Catholic.

553
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:53,979
It's Latin.
I guarantee you, this is Latin.

554
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,775
Latin? Who speaks Latin?

555
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:58,379
People in Latin America.

556
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:02,335
Oh, God. It...
Listen, it sounds like Latin.

557
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:04,064
-It's not that.
-Lie-bee-ra.

558
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:05,784
I guarantee you that's Latin.

559
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:17,137
Well, I know the words,
but I don't actually speak the language.

560
00:44:19,066 --> 00:44:23,423
Now, Father Price at Saint Xavier,
he was a linguistics professor.

561
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:24,859
He could help.

562
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:02,505
When you get to be my age,

563
00:45:02,586 --> 00:45:07,216
it's a comfort to have those reminders
of some accomplishments.

564
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,260
-Sit, sit down, please.
-Thank you, Father.

565
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:12,504
They're your students?

566
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,259
No.

567
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:17,304
We used to take in orphans
and find them homes.

568
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,379
But you don't any more.

569
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:22,265
No.

570
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:25,981
But you didn't come here
to talk about that.

571
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,055
No.

572
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:32,504
Could you help me and tell me
what that means?

573
00:45:35,546 --> 00:45:37,343
<i>Libera.</i>

574
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:40,020
It's the imperative of the Latin verb

575
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:43,462
that is at the root of liberty.
Liberate.

576
00:45:44,346 --> 00:45:47,736
Well, let me see.
With the E following,

577
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:51,663
<i>eos. Libera eos.</i>

578
00:45:51,746 --> 00:45:53,259
Deliver them.

579
00:45:53,346 --> 00:45:58,420
So does that phrase mean
anything special to you?

580
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:01,142
<i>Libera nos domine.</i>

581
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:04,061
Now, that's quite a common phrase.

582
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:06,099
Free us, Lord.

583
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:09,144
<i>Libera.</i>

584
00:46:09,786 --> 00:46:14,257
<i>Re-eos. Liberare eos. Liberare eos.</i>

585
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:16,264
And what does that mean?

586
00:46:16,346 --> 00:46:17,574
Set them free.

587
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,735
So, they're similar.

588
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,141
Similar, yes, but not at all the same.
Do you...

589
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,945
Do you know anything about
the history of the written Bible?

590
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:28,223
Well, I always thought
it was kind of like

591
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:30,900
a 2,000-year-old game
of broken telephone.

592
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:37,136
Let me explain.
The Bible, as we know it,

593
00:46:37,786 --> 00:46:41,461
was composed around 400 Anno Domini.

594
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,415
It contained an oral component,

595
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:47,942
because elements of that Bible were
prohibited from being written down.

596
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:53,381
Forbidden songs. Blessings conferred
upon the closest of Christ's disciples.

597
00:46:53,826 --> 00:46:57,262
These were meant to be communicated
only between high priests,

598
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:00,779
because once the blessing was offered,

599
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:03,380
the listener became the keeper of it.

600
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,503
And the speaker,
on certain occasions,

601
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:09,626
offered himself up as a sacrifice.

602
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:11,539
For what?

603
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:18,024
<i>Liberare eos.</i>
A sacrifice to set them free.

604
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:20,659
So you do know what it means.

605
00:47:23,026 --> 00:47:24,300
I have...

606
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:27,058
Here.

607
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:32,942
When the women went to complete
the burial rites at Christ's tomb,

608
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:34,254
they found it empty.

609
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:38,141
Their service was rewarded by
the Holy Ghost with that prayer.

610
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:40,182
A consecration against death.

611
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:42,504
So immortality?

612
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:44,577
No, not quite.

613
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,341
<i>Liberare eos</i>
is a prayer of resurrection.

614
00:47:51,426 --> 00:47:52,495
Okay.

615
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:57,500
Back then, people had deeper faith.

616
00:47:57,946 --> 00:47:59,061
Blind faith.

617
00:48:00,226 --> 00:48:02,103
Profound faith.

618
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:09,536
Well, how exactly does it work?

619
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,537
I promise I won't tell anybody.

620
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:17,585
It required 12 willing souls

621
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:21,341
to sacrifice themselves
to bring back the one.

622
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:24,420
Now, the operative word is "willing."

623
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,261
Once the final life was given,

624
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:32,380
the prayer was spoken aloud
and witnessed.

625
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:38,186
And then those 12 disciples
who sacrificed themselves

626
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,905
were granted eternal salvation.

627
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:43,659
And the chosen one was reborn.

628
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:49,140
I mean, you know,
this is early Christian mysticism.

629
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,217
This pre-dates even the Vatican.

630
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:53,937
And do you really believe this stuff?

631
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:59,297
I did, yes, once.

632
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:01,695
But times are different now.

633
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:07,304
Unwavering belief in the church
is difficult to sustain.

634
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:11,622
Perhaps, I mean, I think,
quite possibly,

635
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,458
with good reason.

636
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:18,938
I find it fascinating
that someone like you

637
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:23,304
would be interested
in unearthing this prayer

638
00:49:23,386 --> 00:49:27,425
that has been for 1,500 years,

639
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,861
by and large, lost.

640
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:33,621
I think somebody may have found it.

641
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,537
If you can sleep on the floor,
why can't I sleep in my chair?

642
00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:24,344
'Cause I'm special.

643
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:27,736
-Let's go up.
-You certainly are.

644
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:43,144
Hey, do you remember that gold cross
that Delia Chandler bought online?

645
00:50:43,226 --> 00:50:45,296
-Yeah.
-They never got it.

646
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:46,739
Nothing showed up at Delia's either.

647
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:50,141
-So?
-Overstock.com shipped it to a PO box

648
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:53,059
in Port Hardy, BC,
addressed to Jane Buck.

649
00:50:53,906 --> 00:50:55,897
-BC?
-I called Delia's son.

650
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,625
He's never heard of her.

651
00:50:58,146 --> 00:51:00,341
The post office wouldn't give out
any information over the phone.

652
00:51:00,426 --> 00:51:02,701
So I looked up Jane Buck
in the local white pages and guess what?

653
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:03,855
What?

654
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:08,622
There's a phone number and home address
10 miles from that PO box.

655
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:22,375
Go for it.

656
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:33,977
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello.

657
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,624
Is this Jane Buck?

658
00:51:36,466 --> 00:51:37,501
<i>Who is this?</i>

659
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:40,783
This is Officer Ben Wingate,
from the Fort Dundas Police Department.

660
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:44,825
You wouldn't happen to know anyone
by the name of Delia Chandler, would you?

661
00:51:47,986 --> 00:51:49,578
<i>This isn't a good time.</i>

662
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:52,658
Okay. When would be a good time?

663
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:59,220
Could be a lead.

664
00:51:59,306 --> 00:52:01,376
Come on, you gotta let me go.

665
00:52:02,106 --> 00:52:05,382
I would love to let you go, but
I don't have the money to fly you there.

666
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:10,024
My mom gives me AIR MILES every year
for Christmas. I've never used them.

667
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:13,578
I found our Olds.

668
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:26,136
This is where he got the ticket.

669
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:33,183
Okay. Well, let's start
knocking on some doors.

670
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:39,018
So you just let him in?

671
00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:42,576
I spoke with him for
quite a while at the diner.

672
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:45,624
My daughter was very sick
and I believed that he could help her.

673
00:52:46,786 --> 00:52:49,903
I was desperate.
Nothing else was working.

674
00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:51,942
What did he look like?

675
00:52:52,026 --> 00:52:53,857
Tall, thin.

676
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:56,303
He had a big bag.

677
00:52:56,386 --> 00:53:00,061
Dark coat. Sandy blonde hair.
Beard.

678
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:05,174
I remember he had kind eyes.
I don't know if that helps.

679
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:08,704
Okay, so you let him in
and then what happened?

680
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,458
He gave her some tea.

681
00:53:10,826 --> 00:53:14,535
He came out,
he said she was sleeping.

682
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:19,424
So I looked in on her.
She looked peaceful, so I let her rest.

683
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:26,065
Then she woke up screaming,
vomiting, burning up.

684
00:53:26,146 --> 00:53:28,102
I took her to the hospital.

685
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:31,656
They told us it was a 50-50 chance
she'd make it through the night.

686
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:38,415
Two days later the vomiting stopped
and the MRI was clear.

687
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,574
Yeah, hon.

688
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,145
I want to show you a drawing.

689
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:46,740
Okay. Excuse me just for a second.

690
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:52,626
Killers kill. They don't heal.

691
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:56,619
You know, Jesus raised
a little girl from the dead.

692
00:53:56,706 --> 00:53:59,459
She was about that age. It was
one of his top 10 miracles, actually.

693
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:02,265
-You're referencing scriptures now?
-I did my research.

694
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:06,100
-Okay, so you really believe that this guy...
-I think she believes that this guy...

695
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:07,619
-Hi.
-Hi.

696
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,657
Simon said you would come.

697
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:13,418
His name is Simon?

698
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:16,696
And did Simon say anything else?

699
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,539
He said the police would be
looking for him.

700
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:23,858
That they would say he did bad things.
But he's not bad.

701
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:27,304
He taught me a song.

702
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:31,501
<i># Simple Simon went to look</i>

703
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,975
<i># if plums grew on a thistle</i>

704
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:37,144
<i># He pricked his fingers very much</i>

705
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:40,377
<i># which made poor Simon whistle</i>

706
00:54:42,906 --> 00:54:44,225
Great. Thanks.

707
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,822
<i>...today with a high of plus four.</i>

708
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:55,339
<i>There is a snowfall warning, though.</i>

709
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,894
<i>Expect up to 10 centimetres</i>
<i>of snow overnight.</i>

710
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:00,546
<i>For the coast of Haida Gwaii,</i>
<i>rain, a high of plus eight,</i>

711
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:03,538
<i>inland rain as well as</i>
<i>a high of plus seven degrees.</i>

712
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:37,337
Hazel, sorry.
These came for you from the coroner.

713
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,344
-Great. Thanks.
-Do you need anything?

714
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:41,894
-No.
-Coffee or ibuprofen, I...

715
00:55:41,986 --> 00:55:43,578
-No, I'm fine, thanks.
-Okay.

716
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:46,055
-Do you want me to do anything for you?
-No.

717
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:47,977
-Okay, well, let me know.
-Okay.

718
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:49,465
-Awesome. Okay.
-Okay.

719
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,980
-You are relentlessly cheerful.
-Well, I try.

720
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:53,499
Yeah.

721
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,903
Where are we going?

722
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:39,026
Warren, hi. It's Hazel.

723
00:57:39,106 --> 00:57:40,585
Yeah, quick question.

724
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:45,501
Ruby Marshall,
was she sick when she died?

725
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:48,783
Yeah, I know her head was
in the freezer. I'm asking...

726
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:49,901
Sarco...

727
00:57:49,986 --> 00:57:51,738
And is that terminal?

728
00:57:53,146 --> 00:57:56,218
Okay, thanks, yep.
That really helps me.

729
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:58,779
Okay. Bye.

730
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:01,665
Hey! This is private property.

731
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,940
You don't leave, I'm gonna call the...

732
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,019
Jane Buck?

733
00:59:07,626 --> 00:59:09,264
Let me see that.

734
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,134
Just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

735
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:16,696
I just bring in the mail.

736
00:59:18,386 --> 00:59:19,705
For who?

737
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:22,300
You can't arrest me.
I haven't done anything.

738
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,262
I'm not gonna arrest you.

739
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:27,621
Just tell me what's in the camper.

740
00:59:30,306 --> 00:59:31,580
Gifts.

741
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,499
Who from?

742
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,784
The disciples.

743
00:59:39,386 --> 00:59:40,899
What?

744
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:43,655
You can't go in there.

745
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,338
-Then let me...
-You don't have a warrant.

746
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:47,576
-You cannot go in there.
-Please. Miss, step aside.

747
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:01,825
You don't know what you've done.

748
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:03,703
You don't know what you've done!

749
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,705
Oh, God!

750
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,414
Oh, God.

751
01:01:39,146 --> 01:01:40,420
Okay.

752
01:01:58,226 --> 01:01:59,818
No, I didn't touch anything.

753
01:01:59,906 --> 01:02:01,817
I took some pictures
with my cell phone.

754
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:03,862
I just got the hell outta there.

755
01:02:03,946 --> 01:02:05,299
Did you call the BC police?

756
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:07,820
<i>No. I figured it would be better</i>
<i>to keep a low profile.</i>

757
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:09,624
What about the body?

758
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:11,503
<i>He's been soaking in</i>
<i>formaldehyde for months.</i>

759
01:02:11,586 --> 01:02:12,780
<i>I don't think he's going anywhere.</i>

760
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:18,418
So do you think that your mom
has enough points to get you to Montreal?

761
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:20,575
What are you doing?

762
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,065
<i>You think that's where he's headed?</i>

763
01:02:22,146 --> 01:02:25,297
Well, he started in BC,
he's been going east ever since.

764
01:02:25,386 --> 01:02:28,822
I think it's a good bet.
You could go there, get a car

765
01:02:28,906 --> 01:02:30,942
and check out the Eastern Townships.

766
01:02:31,026 --> 01:02:32,459
<i>I'm on it.</i>

767
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:37,737
Hazel, we can't let this green kid
go out on some wild goose chase

768
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:38,941
on his own dime.

769
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:40,300
What other choice do we have?

770
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:41,660
I'll call Mason.

771
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:44,780
Give me two days,
then you can call Mason.

772
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:49,018
If Wingate makes any kind of mistake,
this guy walks on a technicality.

773
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:53,306
He's not gonna make a mistake.

774
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:23,583
-I'm telling you she was expecting him.
-What do you mean?

775
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,099
Well, the dress she was wearing,

776
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:27,416
that was delivered from the cleaners
the day before.

777
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,656
And she vacuumed the carpet.

778
01:03:30,066 --> 01:03:31,135
You're over-thinking this.

779
01:03:31,226 --> 01:03:33,023
No. She was wearing pantyhose.

780
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:35,415
Delia only wore pantyhose
when she went to church.

781
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:37,098
Well, maybe she was going out
for lunch.

782
01:03:37,186 --> 01:03:39,142
No, she was trying to impress him.

783
01:03:39,226 --> 01:03:42,855
Now we're getting off track.
It's simpler than that, Hazel.

784
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:44,618
He was preying on the weak.

785
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:46,537
He was preying on the faithful.

786
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:48,744
When was the last time you went
to church?

787
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,544
-My cousin's wedding.
-To pray?

788
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,856
The only god I ever prayed
to was Guy Lafleur.

789
01:03:52,946 --> 01:03:54,140
Exactly.

790
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:58,105
Now he was promising them salvation.

791
01:03:58,186 --> 01:03:59,778
In exchange for what?

792
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:01,857
In exchange for their deaths.

793
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:03,982
So why butcher them?

794
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:06,102
It's for show, just to confuse us.

795
01:04:10,106 --> 01:04:11,903
Then how did he find her?

796
01:04:17,106 --> 01:04:19,017
There is nothing weird in here.

797
01:04:24,346 --> 01:04:26,780
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

798
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:30,696
Maybe I should call Melanie.

799
01:04:30,786 --> 01:04:32,139
There's nothing.

800
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:34,501
Well, maybe somebody erased it.

801
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:37,345
Wait.

802
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,894
Wait, wait.

803
01:04:55,386 --> 01:04:56,501
Look at that.

804
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:57,905
What am I looking at?

805
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:01,342
Massach, faithforthedying.com.

806
01:05:05,146 --> 01:05:06,738
<i>We have nine victims</i>

807
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:09,545
<i>who said three-quarters of</i>
<i>the prayer of resurrection.</i>

808
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:11,423
<i>There were 12 apostles.</i>

809
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:15,385
<i>So he needs three more victims</i>
<i>to finish the prayer.</i>

810
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:22,702
Okay, so this email address is actually
linked to a bunch of different websites.

811
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:27,060
Most of them are chat rooms talking
about cancer, suicide, heart disease.

812
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:36,060
That's how he's recruiting them.

813
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:16,905
What's LTP?

814
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:18,465
Let's talk privately.

815
01:06:21,386 --> 01:06:23,422
Okay, see this T Lawrence?

816
01:06:23,506 --> 01:06:26,020
I need to find out
where that person lives.

817
01:06:41,186 --> 01:06:42,938
Are you ready to begin?

818
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,055
Of course.

819
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:14,218
If you are going to be a part of this,

820
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:17,264
I will have to cleanse you
of your transgressions.

821
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:26,863
Close your eyes.

822
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,741
<i>Yeah, I'm pulling up now.</i>

823
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:40,384
Okay, what can you see?

824
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,419
Looks clear.

825
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:44,499
There's no cars in the driveway.

826
01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:47,896
<i>-See if you can get a little peek inside.</i>
-Okay.

827
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:06,096
There's nobody home.

828
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:07,744
What do you want me to do?

829
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:10,784
<i>Well, see if you can peek</i>
<i>in the window, see what's inside.</i>

830
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:13,824
You're not sending him in there.

831
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:15,419
This may be our only chance.

832
01:08:15,506 --> 01:08:18,100
-He's a kid, for Christ sake.
-He's a police officer.

833
01:08:19,146 --> 01:08:20,977
You wait for backup, Wingate.

834
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:22,420
<i>We don't have time to wait.</i>

835
01:08:22,506 --> 01:08:24,462
I'm gonna go around back.

836
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:25,899
Standard procedure, Wingate.

837
01:08:25,986 --> 01:08:27,817
-No! No! Just back off.
-You call for backup, you wait.

838
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:29,180
-Come on, he's gotta get in there.
-Call for backup.

839
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:30,534
The guy's gonna get away.
We're not gonna wait.

840
01:08:30,626 --> 01:08:32,742
<i>-No. No. Back off.</i>
<i>-Wingate, call for backup and wait.</i>

841
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:34,544
<i>Come on. You go ahead.</i>
<i>Check out the window.</i>

842
01:08:34,626 --> 01:08:36,776
<i>-Wait for backup. You secure the perimeter.</i>
<i>-Go around the back.</i>

843
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:40,176
<i>He can't wait!</i>
<i>The guy's going to be gone!</i>

844
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,386
There's blood.
There's blood everywhere.

845
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:45,615
-Stand down, Wingate!
-No! No!

846
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:47,185
<i>Wait for backup!</i>

847
01:08:47,266 --> 01:08:49,097
<i>Wingate, proceed. Listen to me.</i>

848
01:08:49,186 --> 01:08:50,221
Where are you?

849
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:53,178
Wingate! Tell me what's going on.

850
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,985
I'm in the backyard.

851
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:58,102
<i>Don't listen to Hazel!</i>

852
01:08:58,786 --> 01:09:02,017
You are risking his life.
You are throwing away your job and mine.

853
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:03,175
This is my job!

854
01:09:03,266 --> 01:09:04,540
I'm going in.

855
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,019
Wingate?

856
01:09:15,746 --> 01:09:17,225
Wingate!

857
01:09:17,906 --> 01:09:18,895
Ben?

858
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:32,066
<i>Ben? Ben?</i>

859
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:41,105
<i>Hello, Hazel.</i>

860
01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:45,544
Who is this?

861
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:49,505
<i>Well, you know who it is. Otherwise,</i>
<i>you wouldn't send poor Ben out to</i>

862
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,781
look for Dr Lawrence, would you?

863
01:09:52,546 --> 01:09:54,025
<i>I swear to God, if you touch...</i>

864
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,698
Hazel, relax.

865
01:09:56,346 --> 01:09:58,223
<i>He looked so tired.</i>

866
01:09:58,306 --> 01:10:01,025
You've been working him so hard
I gave him something to sleep.

867
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:05,418
<i>Did you get my package?</i>

868
01:10:08,426 --> 01:10:10,417
<i>I have to go now, Hazel.</i>

869
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,459
<i>But I have faith...</i>

870
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:15,816
Our paths will cross again.

871
01:10:28,546 --> 01:10:32,539
Yeah. This is Detective Ray Greene
from Fort Dundas PD.

872
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:34,981
I need a full response unit
to 76 Dollard Street.

873
01:10:36,386 --> 01:10:37,819
There's an officer down.

874
01:10:43,026 --> 01:10:47,304
Mason offered me the CO job
six months ago. I turned it down.

875
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:53,062
Maybe you should have taken it.

876
01:11:27,026 --> 01:11:28,857
<i>Is it on?</i>

877
01:11:33,146 --> 01:11:35,535
<i>Today I'm leaving this body</i>

878
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:38,382
<i>that has tortured me for years.</i>

879
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:43,104
<i>But it has given me</i>
<i>the moments I treasure.</i>

880
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,055
<i>Running, as a child,</i>

881
01:11:46,146 --> 01:11:48,706
<i>dancing with my husband.</i>

882
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:52,538
<i>Bringing my son into this world.</i>

883
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:56,662
<i>I want to live,</i>

884
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,577
<i>but not like this.</i>

885
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:05,304
<i>I love you and I want you to know</i>
<i>that I'm trusting my body</i>

886
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,342
<i>to someone worthy,</i>

887
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:12,898
<i>who will cleanse my spirit</i>
<i>and bring me home.</i>

888
01:12:16,026 --> 01:12:18,586
<i>Remember me as I was.</i>

889
01:12:19,466 --> 01:12:22,822
<i>Thank Dr Reiner for his kindness.</i>

890
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:27,899
<i>Give Jenny a big kiss from grandma.</i>

891
01:14:09,786 --> 01:14:12,175
I had the photos blown up
that I took in the trailer.

892
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:15,258
It's Delia's necklace and all the other
gifts the victims sent to Simon.

893
01:14:15,346 --> 01:14:18,463
No. Come back here.
Really, how are you doing?

894
01:14:25,386 --> 01:14:28,458
Actually, he had that syringe
to my neck

895
01:14:29,786 --> 01:14:31,663
before I even saw his face.

896
01:14:32,986 --> 01:14:34,624
Yeah.

897
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:44,697
-What?
-My God, I'd swear...

898
01:14:45,346 --> 01:14:48,543
This is Father Price in this picture,
like 30 years ago.

899
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:56,624
What is a picture of Father Price
doing in a trailer

900
01:14:56,706 --> 01:14:58,856
halfway across the country?

901
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,460
What I'm about to undergo

902
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:44,375
is a sin in His eyes.

903
01:15:47,346 --> 01:15:49,462
Are you afraid, Father?

904
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,976
Today is my day ofjudgement,
of reckoning.

905
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,424
Of course I am.

906
01:16:00,826 --> 01:16:02,305
Of what?

907
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,057
You know, Peter.

908
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:10,095
Of being told that my mistake,

909
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,142
my mistake alone

910
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:16,305
is what led us here to this sin.

911
01:16:18,386 --> 01:16:22,618
Gabriel's sufferings led me to
the prayer. And the prayer is pure.

912
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:25,744
It was never meant to be used
this way!

913
01:16:27,426 --> 01:16:30,384
Only Christ can raise the dead.

914
01:16:31,346 --> 01:16:33,621
Christ is in us all.

915
01:16:34,706 --> 01:16:36,424
You taught me that.

916
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:43,181
I am allowing you

917
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,900
to trespass on my soul.

918
01:16:49,786 --> 01:16:53,096
It's a sin, Peter. It's a sin.

919
01:16:53,186 --> 01:16:56,383
I'm the one committing
the sin, Father, not you.

920
01:16:57,306 --> 01:16:59,740
When all the sacrifices are complete,

921
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:02,820
God will forgive the trespasses.

922
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:12,061
May God forgive us both.

923
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:19,343
I would like to pray.

924
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:22,497
Of course, Father.

925
01:17:24,786 --> 01:17:26,822
Our Father,

926
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:29,302
which art in heaven,

927
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,177
hallowed be Thy name.

928
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,704
Thy kingdom come,

929
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,740
<i>Thy will be done on earth</i>
<i>as it is in heaven.</i>

930
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,418
<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>

931
01:17:46,186 --> 01:17:48,063
and forgive us our trespasses

932
01:17:49,906 --> 01:17:53,296
as we forgive those who trespass
against us.

933
01:17:54,626 --> 01:18:00,223
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

934
01:18:02,106 --> 01:18:06,497
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

935
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:11,303
<i>forever and ever.</i>

936
01:18:16,706 --> 01:18:18,424
Amen.

937
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:22,419
Amen.

938
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:29,696
Where's your pain today, Father?

939
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:33,938
Everywhere.

940
01:18:54,586 --> 01:18:56,383
I love you, Father.

941
01:19:22,746 --> 01:19:24,577
Father Price.

942
01:19:25,706 --> 01:19:27,424
Father Price?

943
01:19:35,786 --> 01:19:37,538
He's not here.

944
01:20:08,426 --> 01:20:11,623
Sister, excuse me.
I'm sorry to have to do this now,

945
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:14,425
but could you tell me if you know

946
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:17,179
what happened to any of the boys
in this picture?

947
01:20:25,306 --> 01:20:27,536
These two boys,

948
01:20:28,946 --> 01:20:31,619
Peter and Gabriel Mallick.

949
01:20:34,066 --> 01:20:36,739
We could only find a home
for one of them.

950
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:41,221
Father Price chose
to send the younger boy,

951
01:20:43,106 --> 01:20:44,744
Gabriel.

952
01:20:48,706 --> 01:20:51,618
We didn't ask a lot of questions
in those days.

953
01:20:55,346 --> 01:20:58,338
Broke his heart when he learned
how he had suffered.

954
01:21:02,346 --> 01:21:06,055
Peter found him, took him in.
They moved out West.

955
01:21:06,546 --> 01:21:08,264
Away.

956
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:12,265
But it was too late.
He was never the same.

957
01:21:16,026 --> 01:21:19,814
Gabriel took his own life last year.

958
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:23,695
A few weeks later,
Father Price grew ill.

959
01:21:24,106 --> 01:21:25,698
Cancer.

960
01:21:26,626 --> 01:21:29,618
He felt it was God's way
of punishing him.

961
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:35,257
When was the last time
that you saw Peter?

962
01:21:35,946 --> 01:21:38,824
Three months ago,
after his brother's passing,

963
01:21:38,906 --> 01:21:41,500
he came to Sunday service.

964
01:21:41,866 --> 01:21:43,936
Said he was going on a long trip.

965
01:21:45,186 --> 01:21:48,223
And a few weeks ago
he called Father Price.

966
01:21:49,746 --> 01:21:51,577
-Really?
-Yes.

967
01:21:53,946 --> 01:21:55,299
I figured out who he is.

968
01:21:55,386 --> 01:21:57,104
His name is Peter Mallick
and he changed his...

969
01:21:57,186 --> 01:21:58,175
We know.

970
01:21:58,266 --> 01:22:00,177
-What do you mean, you know?
-We got into his email account.

971
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:02,382
We know who he is.
We know where he's going.

972
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:03,865
Carl Smotes.

973
01:22:03,946 --> 01:22:06,619
We're coordinating with the RCMP
to put him into protective custody.

974
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:07,934
When?

975
01:22:08,026 --> 01:22:09,778
It's not your concern any more, Hazel.

976
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:12,505
-What? What are you talking about?
-We can handle this.

977
01:22:12,586 --> 01:22:14,736
No! I wanna be there.
What do you mean, you can handle it?

978
01:22:14,826 --> 01:22:16,100
I'm the one that figured it out.

979
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:17,619
I'm the one that told you about it

980
01:22:17,706 --> 01:22:18,695
-in the first place.
-You're done!

981
01:22:18,786 --> 01:22:20,185
-And you wouldn't even listen to...
-You're done!

982
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:22,177
I'm not done! I wanna be there.

983
01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:24,143
What do you want from me,
an apology?

984
01:22:25,026 --> 01:22:27,620
I am sorry. You were right.

985
01:22:28,226 --> 01:22:32,822
There's a serial killer.
Does that make you feel better?

986
01:22:34,426 --> 01:22:35,779
Fuck you.

987
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:11,544
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, it's me.

988
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:12,741
Did they get him?

989
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:14,897
<i>No. It's gonna be a long night.</i>

990
01:24:16,546 --> 01:24:18,423
They brought in the cavalry.

991
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,177
You should be here.

992
01:24:22,826 --> 01:24:25,579
<i>The guys are all really impressed</i>
<i>with what you did.</i>

993
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,543
<i>You saved a man's life.</i>

994
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:30,584
Well, if he was talking to Simon
then that meant he wanted to die.

995
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:32,497
So I don't think he's gonna be
too happy.

996
01:24:32,586 --> 01:24:35,464
<i>Well, when he shows up,</i>
<i>we're gonna get him.</i>

997
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:37,504
What if he doesn't show up?

998
01:24:37,626 --> 01:24:40,094
I don't know.
I mean, he's come this far.

999
01:24:40,186 --> 01:24:41,505
I don't think he's gonna stop now.

1000
01:24:41,586 --> 01:24:44,054
<i>One away from getting</i>
<i>his 12 disciples?</i>

1001
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:45,704
<i>He's coming.</i>

1002
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:50,098
<i>Are you still there?</i>

1003
01:24:50,506 --> 01:24:51,655
Yeah, I'm here.

1004
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:54,740
I have my day off tomorrow.

1005
01:24:55,666 --> 01:24:58,100
<i>Why don't I come by?</i>
<i>I'll cook you dinner.</i>

1006
01:24:59,546 --> 01:25:00,535
<i>Goodnight, Wingate.</i>

1007
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,704
I'll get you something for that.

1008
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,897
Why did you bring me here?

1009
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:48,385
You brought us together.

1010
01:26:49,026 --> 01:26:50,459
You heard the calling when

1011
01:26:51,746 --> 01:26:53,782
everyone around you could not.

1012
01:26:53,866 --> 01:26:57,700
And you chose to become a part of it.

1013
01:27:02,146 --> 01:27:05,741
This is where
we're supposed to be, together,

1014
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:08,697
under the eyes of God.

1015
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,378
And this is where it will end.

1016
01:27:14,106 --> 01:27:15,095
No.

1017
01:27:15,626 --> 01:27:17,856
-For your pain.
-No.

1018
01:27:20,386 --> 01:27:22,138
All the disciples
gave themselves willingly.

1019
01:27:22,226 --> 01:27:25,377
Murdering you would not honour
the prayer.

1020
01:27:27,586 --> 01:27:31,295
Do you want your pain
to end or do you not?

1021
01:27:32,826 --> 01:27:34,578
It is your choice.

1022
01:28:19,146 --> 01:28:21,023
It's remarkable, isn't it?

1023
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:22,899
What is it?

1024
01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:26,943
A hybrid of many plants.
Grown here.

1025
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:32,418
You could be helping people
instead of

1026
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:34,655
doing this.

1027
01:28:34,746 --> 01:28:35,781
I am

1028
01:28:37,866 --> 01:28:40,699
helping people.

1029
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:49,377
I know you lost your brother and
you'll do anything to bring him back.

1030
01:28:50,586 --> 01:28:52,417
But what is the point?

1031
01:28:52,506 --> 01:28:55,543
I mean, he killed himself.
He doesn't want to be alive.

1032
01:28:55,626 --> 01:28:57,856
He wanted to die.

1033
01:29:00,546 --> 01:29:02,662
Everyone deserves a second chance.

1034
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:08,335
Hazel, I lost my brother
but I never lost my faith in God.

1035
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:10,978
When he returns,

1036
01:29:12,946 --> 01:29:14,299
he will be cleansed,

1037
01:29:16,586 --> 01:29:17,860
as will you.

1038
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:49,022
Can you imagine a day

1039
01:29:49,106 --> 01:29:54,055
when you're not clouded
by all that alcohol?

1040
01:29:58,066 --> 01:29:59,340
No.

1041
01:30:00,386 --> 01:30:03,742
Tell me something beautiful,

1042
01:30:04,826 --> 01:30:08,216
something good that
you've brought to this world.

1043
01:30:13,226 --> 01:30:14,341
Nothing.

1044
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:19,062
Have you ever loved? Really loved

1045
01:30:20,266 --> 01:30:21,540
someone?

1046
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,975
Someone other than yourself?

1047
01:30:30,266 --> 01:30:34,544
What have you lost, truly lost,

1048
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:39,139
that had some meaning for you?

1049
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:47,263
My baby.

1050
01:31:05,786 --> 01:31:07,742
This is your chance.

1051
01:31:12,146 --> 01:31:16,583
Drink this and all your suffering
will be gone.

1052
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:21,744
Drink this
and bring meaning to your life.

1053
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:26,221
Drink this
and offer the disciples unto God.

1054
01:31:26,946 --> 01:31:33,545
Drink this
and bring life back to this world.

1055
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:39,778
Let go.

1056
01:31:49,866 --> 01:31:51,060
I can't.

1057
01:31:51,146 --> 01:31:53,979
I want another chance, please.

1058
01:32:23,386 --> 01:32:24,899
It's okay.

1059
01:32:31,866 --> 01:32:33,697
It will all be over soon.

1060
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,380
Andrew, nice to meet you. Gladys.

1061
01:34:21,466 --> 01:34:23,696
-No, it's Glynnis.
-Okay.

1062
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:24,980
Ben?

1063
01:34:25,066 --> 01:34:27,216
Hey, man. Come on in.

1064
01:34:27,306 --> 01:34:28,705
Yeah.

1065
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:31,982
I'm gonna come back again
another time.

1066
01:34:32,986 --> 01:34:34,419
You sure?

1067
01:34:36,226 --> 01:34:37,545
Yeah.

1068
01:34:38,346 --> 01:34:39,779
Give this to her for me?

1069
01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:41,859
Yeah, okay.

1070
01:34:42,346 --> 01:34:43,620
Thanks.

1071
01:34:50,506 --> 01:34:52,736
Sorry. Should I...

1072
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:56,936
-Should I...
-Come on in.

1073
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,459
How is she doing?

1074
01:35:01,866 --> 01:35:04,505
-Drugs finally knocked her out.
-Right.

1075
01:35:05,026 --> 01:35:08,814
She's probably got quite a tolerance.

1076
01:35:09,026 --> 01:35:10,061
Yeah.

1077
01:35:10,146 --> 01:35:13,377
-Andrew and his wife are in the hall.
-Oh, dear.

1078
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:19,144
-I'll go head 'em off.
-Okay. Do I... Right.

1079
01:35:38,026 --> 01:35:40,256
-Hey.
-Hey.

1080
01:35:42,706 --> 01:35:46,494
It's from Ray.
The flowers are from me.

1081
01:35:47,906 --> 01:35:49,134
I'm allergic.

1082
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:54,901
Why am I not surprised?

1083
01:35:55,226 --> 01:35:59,663
This is also from me and Ray.

1084
01:36:01,706 --> 01:36:04,379
-You did it.
-We did it.

1085
01:36:08,586 --> 01:36:10,497
What about his brother?

1086
01:36:10,586 --> 01:36:14,340
Vancouver PD sent some guys
to recover the body.

1087
01:36:14,626 --> 01:36:16,742
I just haven't heard anything yet.

1088
01:36:17,426 --> 01:36:18,825
Let me know.

1089
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:23,736
I'll be out in that hall
until I know, okay?

1090
01:36:25,706 --> 01:36:27,105
Okay.

1091
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,304
I want my mom.

1092
01:36:39,946 --> 01:36:41,857
These drugs must be working.

1093
01:36:56,986 --> 01:36:58,658
You're awake.

1094
01:37:01,186 --> 01:37:02,175
What's this?

1095
01:37:02,546 --> 01:37:06,255
Ray. He didn't bring glasses
or ice or anything.

1096
01:37:06,346 --> 01:37:08,223
Forget about it.

1097
01:37:11,466 --> 01:37:12,865
You look terrible.

1098
01:37:15,266 --> 01:37:19,145
Yeah. It's better than dead.

1099
01:37:21,226 --> 01:37:22,944
Much better.

1100
01:37:55,186 --> 01:37:56,380
Police!
