1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,852
Hi.

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,766
Don't be late for judge Nicastro.

3
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:26,696
Are you kidding? I'm up, I'm ready, I'm...

4
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:28,265
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

5
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:34,007
- This is ridiculous.
- We're seizing your boat.

6
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,518
What about due process?
Come on. I live here.

7
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:37,615
Not anymore.

8
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,479
You can't be serious.

9
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:41,876
Andrew.

10
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,006
I'm so glad that you called me.

11
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:45,506
Who are you?

12
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,446
My name is Kate Reed and I'm his lawyer.

13
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:49,220
Okay.

14
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,581
No one's setting foot today
on Mr. McKinnon's boat

15
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,734
but Mr. McKinnon.

16
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:53,961
Ms. Reed, your client is in violation...

17
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:55,624
He filed the wrong paperwork.

18
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,098
I didn't file any paperwork.

19
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,973
Which is still wrong.
But he's not a drug dealer.

20
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:00,643
He's an idiot.

21
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,976
Just didn't file the paperwork.

22
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,762
- Which is idiotic.
- The point is...

23
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,522
The point is this is America.

24
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,521
We don't board. We do not seize.

25
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:08,866
We're not pirates.

26
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,653
So go take down some bad guys
and make us proud.

27
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,614
Go on.

28
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:13,986
Let's go.

29
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:16,802
This matter needs to be resolved.

30
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:18,122
And resolved it will be.

31
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,165
Don't leave town.

32
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:25,786
Bad.

33
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:28,367
You know, if I knew a little customs
issue was the only thing...

34
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,398
No. . No time for flirting today.

35
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,989
Mm-mm-mm. I am almost late and I can't be.

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,251
You see, this judge, he totally hates me.

37
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:38,133
So call me at the office and
we'll discuss this later.

38
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,159
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,391
I didn't even know you're a lawyer.

40
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:45,405
I'm not. Well, I used to be.

41
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,285
- Then how you going to...
- Don't worry about it.

42
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:48,487
I got it covered.

43
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,802
All right.

44
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:58,407
Judge Nicastro's office called.

45
00:01:58,408 --> 00:01:59,803
Well, did you tell him I'm here? I'm here.

46
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:01,644
If you're there, you can tell him yourself.

47
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:07,140
Judge, I'm here. I'm just saying.

48
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,587
You like football, Ms. Reed?

49
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,877
- Is that a trick question?
- Let's start again.

50
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,095
Um, yes, I love football.

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,406
No, I hate football.
Is that the right answer?

52
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,674
I'm not in contempt of anything, am I?

53
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,769
- Ms. Reed?
- Yes, sir?

54
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,995
There's a high school
football coach I know.

55
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,431
Old-school disciplinarian.

56
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,375
Strict. Tough.

57
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,648
Sounds familiar.

58
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:31,857
Ha. Well, anyway,

59
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:35,651
coach Gardner went after a kid in practice.

60
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:37,793
Quarterback. Really tore into him.

61
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,429
Somebody caught it on video

62
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,346
and the school has suspended the coach.

63
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,492
And, well, now a group of
parents, they're trying

64
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,773
to get him fired.

65
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:49,091
Any time a faculty member is suspended,

66
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:52,176
mediation is triggered automatically.

67
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:55,512
So I'm... I'm assigning the case to you.

68
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:58,792
- 'Cause I'm the best?
- 'Cause you love football.

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,089
Got it. Um, coach Gardner was your coach?

70
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,289
- No.
- Then he's your best friend?

71
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,090
- Uh, not exactly.
- Judge?

72
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,348
- Oh. Ha. Ah, my son.
- Oh, Bobby.

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,856
Yeah, Bobby.

74
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:18,546
Well, he's turned out
to be a fine young man,

75
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,324
but there was a time when that
was not a likely outcome.

76
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,910
Mm. When he was a teenager?

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,945
Teenagers rebel, judge.

78
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,357
I mean, that's just what they do.

79
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,476
And teenagers with strong fathers

80
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:29,837
rebel even harder.

81
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:33,244
Bobby was running full
speed down the wrong path.

82
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,911
And a lot of wrong paths.

83
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:37,982
- And then he found football?
- He found coach Gardner.

84
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,102
Mm.

85
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,465
The coach took all that
anger that Bobby had

86
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,297
and he made him put it
on the football field.

87
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,355
He learned respect for
the people around him.

88
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:46,700
Respect for himself.

89
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:50,874
Respect for old-school disciplinarians.

90
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,537
I very nearly lost my son.

91
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,294
Coach Gardner saved him.

92
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:58,623
I'm late for court.

93
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,401
Judge, sorry, just one more thing.

94
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,503
Mediators are impartial
so I'm just not sure...

95
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:03,838
I don't want to see him railroaded.

96
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,582
Just be fair.

97
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,323
- I can do that, sir.
- I'll be watching.

98
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,141
Closely.

99
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,273
That's comforting.

101
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,427
Hey, I don't want any
pissant excuses, Riley!

102
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:27,850
You're too stupid to look at your watch

103
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,648
and get here on time,

104
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:29,964
you're too stupid to play on my team,

105
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:30,666
you hear me?

106
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:31,886
Now, when you get your head out of your ass

107
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,003
and start acting like a
man, then you can play!

108
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:35,909
Till then, you sit down and shut up!

109
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:43,491
What are you looking at?
Let's go! Hustle up!

110
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,256
Okay. Who wants to go first?

111
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,563
I send my son now...

112
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,303
That was my son.

113
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,618
Could easily have been any one of ours.

114
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:02,012
This is a pattern of
behavior that has to stop.

115
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:04,606
We need to end this.
We need to fire that man.

116
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,112
I understand that you guys are upset.

117
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:10,402
But this...video tape does
not give us any context

118
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,423
in which to fire him.

119
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:13,948
Well, yes, it does.

120
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,242
Coach Gardner...

121
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,730
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, he ran away.

122
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,482
- Coach Gardner.
- Whoa!

123
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,873
- Coach Gardner left.
- Oh, yeah. He took the stairs.

124
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:37,631
- Why didn't you stop him?
- 'Cause he's a football coach.

125
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,319
I couldn't even stop a guy
like that in a video game.

126
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,763
- Damn it.
- Is there anything I can do?

127
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:43,820
Yes, please. Reschedule for later on today.

128
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,382
- Great.
- Why is that great?

129
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:47,095
I thought you were going to ask me

130
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,107
to chase him down the stairs.

131
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:48,972
Kate.

132
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:51,476
You know what, I should get that.

133
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,670
- Kate.
- Yes. Hold on.

134
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:54,872
Wait. Don't move.

135
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:58,834
Kate Reed's office.

136
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,053
Justin, hi.

137
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,836
Oh. Yeah, sure. Hold on.

138
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,317
It's Justin for Leo.
That's weird, isn't it?

139
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,191
Mm. What happened with
the school mediation?

140
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,330
Why did the coach just leave?

141
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:11,302
Leo!

142
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:13,559
All good. Rescheduling.

143
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,958
They've all been rescheduled
for this afternoon.

144
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,046
See. Told you. Hey, it's Justin for you.

145
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,183
Kate, I am really concerned.

146
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:24,365
Oh, hold that thought. I should get that.

147
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,949
I want to hear what you got to say.

148
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,984
I just really got to get this.

149
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:31,732
Ah. Kate Reed's office. Andrew.

150
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:34,059
Yeah. Um, hold on one second.

151
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,925
Uh, it's a new client. Andrew McKinnon.

152
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,009
Yes.

153
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:44,239
I'm gonna be a while. So...

154
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,786
Yeah, um, you know what, I
haven't had a chance to yet.

155
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:50,815
But why don't you give me your number.

156
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,071
Okay, I'll call you later.
Yeah, promise. Bye.

157
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:57,766
What was that about?

158
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,167
Oh, it's just this... thing...

159
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:01,662
With my neighbor.

160
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:02,927
Mm. Thought he was a client.

161
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,392
- That too.
- So pro bono?

162
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,255
He got cited for a customs violation

163
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,794
and I'm just helping him out.

164
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,660
He's just a nice kid
from Australia, Lauren.

165
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,925
Oh, great. What's the issue?

166
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,909
Failure to declare funds over $10,000.

167
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:19,015
Well, did he file his paperwork

168
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,312
with customs and border protection?

169
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,038
No, he didn't.

170
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,278
But you know what? I'm actually...

171
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,774
I'm just starting to research all of that.

172
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,245
- I'll take it.
- What?

173
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,909
- Said I'll take it.
- Pro bono, Lauren.

174
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,886
For free.

175
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,105
What do you know about customs law?

176
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,698
That we have books about
it in the law library.

177
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,945
You mess up, we'll get sued.

178
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,980
Oh. Okay. It's a money thing.

179
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,665
All right. My world makes sense again.

180
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:51,153
Probably want to know why
Justin is calling me.

181
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,576
Actually, I don't.

182
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,229
Kind of fits in with the rest of my day.

183
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,438
Where are you going now?

184
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,257
To get the other half of my mediation back.

185
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,379
Oh!

186
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,287
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
- Yeah?

187
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,118
Sorry. Is coach Gardner around?

188
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,977
Yeah. I saw him in there. He'll be a while.

189
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,577
- Hi.
- Hey, man.

190
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:54,016
Whoa, lady, you're in
the wrong locker room.

191
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,068
No, no, I'm not.

192
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,836
The girls' locker room
is in full compliance

193
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:02,054
with all the codes and the regulations.

194
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:05,346
I wish I could say the same thing...

195
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:06,747
About the guys'.

196
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:07,589
And you're from the...

197
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,256
San Francisco Department

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,663
of Building Inspection, yes.

199
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,421
You don't look like a building inspector.

200
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,027
What does a building
inspector look like, hmm?

201
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,092
You know, I am old enough to be your...

202
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,115
Mother's very, very young sister.

203
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,954
I'm sorry, but I don't see you
carrying a tape measure or...

204
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:27,228
I don't need a tape measure to know...

205
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,575
That, uh...

206
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,673
These lockers...
these lockers right here...

207
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:40,513
Whoo.

208
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:44,729
Are in violation... of the code.

209
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:47,053
- Because they're too old?
- Small.

210
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:49,599
They're small, fellas.

211
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,820
I mean, they're okay for girls lockers.

212
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:54,667
But for guys...

213
00:09:55,867 --> 00:10:00,156
I mean, you guys, um, you guys need, uh,

214
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,582
man-sized lockers.

215
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,231
Yeah.

216
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:08,020
Where are you going to put your man shirts

217
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:09,452
and your man pants?

218
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,586
And these teeny, tiny little things?

219
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:15,416
No. What about the sports
illustrated cutouts?

220
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,882
Yeah.

221
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,779
And the Victoria's secret models.

222
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:25,098
Those girls, they need
room in your lockers.

223
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,206
Oh! Oh! Oh, oh!

224
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,967
And right here,

225
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:32,792
I'm pretty sure...
there is supposed to be...

226
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,735
A jacuzzi.

227
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,126
That's right. Dreams can come true.

228
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:45,298
I just need one teeny, tiny little thing.

229
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:46,265
What?

230
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,995
The name of the person in charge.

231
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,947
Coach Gardner. Right down the hall.

232
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,202
Thank you.

233
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:00,787
Coach, it's not like that.

234
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,467
I will not stand by, you hear me?

235
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:04,610
- I will stand by...
- What's going on here?

236
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,706
- Are you Rick Riley?
- Yeah.

237
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:12,374
I'm Kate Reed.

238
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,926
I'm the mediator that's handling the case

239
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,735
between coach Gardner and the school.

240
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,135
Don't you have class?

241
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,429
Go.

242
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,936
- Well, that was interesting.
- Yeah. That was private.

243
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,225
No. We're past private, coach.
What's going on?

244
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:34,275
Why'd you leave the mediation this morning?

245
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,342
I need answers.

246
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:40,810
Look, those people don't
know the first thing

247
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:41,961
about what I do.

248
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,816
Those people are the
parents of your players.

249
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,849
Yeah. And they all want the same thing.

250
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,468
They want the results
without the hard work.

251
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,731
Okay. But they have the right
to question the behavior

252
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,565
of the person that they
entrust their children to.

253
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:53,492
- What, are you defending them?
- No.

254
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,208
I'm just saying that they have
the right to ask questions,

255
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,148
especially after seeing that
video, and they might have more

256
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,033
after I tell them what I just saw.

257
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,634
Now, if you don't like what they're saying,

258
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,399
then fine, say something back.

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
The school wants to hear your side.

260
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,675
Judge Nicastro wants to hear your side.

261
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,132
It doesn't matter what I say.

262
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:09,616
That's what's different now.

263
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,477
The parents run the school.

264
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,638
All right, well, if you want
to do something about that,

265
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:17,715
then I suggest you get your ass
to mediation this afternoon.

266
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,968
And this time, you keep it there.

267
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:24,425
Two o'clock.

268
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,750
So here's the thing, Mr. McKinnon...

269
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,460
- Andrew.
- Andrew.

270
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,599
You have to declare large amounts of cash

271
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,279
on entering U.S. waters.

272
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,427
I know, annoying, but it's the law.

273
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,191
It's not for the Andrew
McKinnons of the world.

274
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:45,376
It's for the drug dealers
and the money launderers.

275
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:47,466
I'm entirely in favor of
having those guys arrested.

276
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,403
I mean, they spoil all
the fun for us, right?

277
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:54,018
Well, if you conduct a
transaction over $9,999,

278
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,517
the government tracks it.

279
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:56,741
You were flagged at the bank

280
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,215
when you got your cashier's check.

281
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,616
But I had to buy a new
mainsail for my boat.

282
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:03,962
Ten grand? Is it Mylar?

283
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,402
- You sail?
- Yeah.

284
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,381
My father taught me when we were kids.

285
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,447
Just dinghy sailing.

286
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,622
Do you still keep up with it?

287
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah. My... my late husband had a boat.

288
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,467
But now I'm just much too busy now.

289
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,031
Well, you're never too busy to sail.

290
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,353
I mean, work, sure,

291
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,964
just to make enough to fix your boat up.

292
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:26,924
Hmm.

293
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,765
So where are we with this thing?

294
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:33,143
Well, usually customs seizes
all undeclared currency.

295
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,729
Please tell me you're not serious.

296
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,004
That's how they pay for
those nifty jackets.

297
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,045
Look, don't you worry about it.

298
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,207
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

299
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,612
We'll file the correct paperwork,

300
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,150
you'll pay a small fine,

301
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:46,453
and you and your very fancy mainsail

302
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:49,126
can be on your way back
to Australia in no time.

303
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,200
Puerto Vallarta, actually,

304
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:54,511
or San Juan Islands, or Vancouver.

305
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,848
- Oh.
- But I'm not leaving just yet.

306
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:58,997
Well, I will contact you

307
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,281
as soon as all the proper
paperwork has been filed,

308
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,017
Mr. McKinnon.

309
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,515
- Thanks. Andrew.
- Andrew.

310
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,526
- Yeah. Have a nice day.
- Yeah. Thanks.

311
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,554
You came.

312
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,140
I want to make a statement.

313
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,722
Thank you for coming back.

314
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:37,128
Now, in a mediation,

315
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,620
it's very important for
both sides to be heard.

316
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,966
- Um, am I missing something?
- 'Scuse me?

317
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,958
You saw the video.
There is only one side.

318
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,377
Mr. Riley, there's always another side.

319
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,835
You humiliated my son.

320
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:53,215
You benched him on the biggest game

321
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,224
of the season.

322
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:57,174
And you know how many
scouts were out there.

323
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,642
Oh!

324
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,669
Are you okay?

325
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:04,650
Are you okay?

326
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,409
This doesn't make any sense to me.

327
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,509
The man you're describing is...

328
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,004
Not the man I knew.

329
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,519
Well, Joe Riley has not
pressed assault charges yet.

330
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:24,234
I got him to agree to a mediation

331
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,693
between the school and
the insurance company.

332
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,031
And then after that...

333
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:30,701
We're gonna talk about charges.

334
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,861
The coach has done a lifetime of good.

335
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,772
Now, I am not trying to make excuses

336
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,936
for the crap he did today.

337
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,601
I just... I don't want people losing sight

338
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,761
of all the wonderful
things he did yesterday.

339
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:47,457
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll see what I can do.

340
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,325
Shoot a little higher than that, okay?

341
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:51,753
Yes, judge.

342
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:27,339
You are one lucky moron.

343
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:30,625
Uh, Joe Riley's not
taking you to court yet.

344
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:33,521
We're gonna sit down with
the school's lawyer,

345
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:34,467
the insurance company,

346
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:36,844
and you better hope we
can work something out.

347
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,718
- Do I have to testify?
- No.

348
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:42,014
- Not unless it goes to court.
- Good.

349
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:43,887
Yeah, you'd be horrible on
the stand, wouldn't you?

350
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,320
You know, I don't get you.

351
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:51,327
You've got all this stuff, but
you're just destroying it.

352
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,892
They gave me till 4:00 P.M. to get out,
okay?

353
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:54,690
Oh. Well, let me help you out.

354
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:56,816
- I don't need any help.
- No, it's okay.

355
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,300
I don't mind.

356
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:00,688
I'm an excellent packer.

357
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:02,092
So, coach...

358
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,918
What are you gonna do

359
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:06,957
when you can't coach anymore?

360
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,022
Have you thought about that?

361
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,094
Are you gonna...

362
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:14,983
Be the host at a restaurant or something?

363
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,993
Don't... don't... don't touch those.

364
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,138
You have that kind of charm, you know?

365
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,820
You have a way you can just
make everybody feel welcome.

366
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,881
It's fast packing, right?

367
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,278
Come on. This stuff, it's all meaningless.

368
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,671
- Just stop.
- What are you gonna do?

369
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:30,839
You gonna punch me too?

370
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,009
Ah! Jeez!

371
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,699
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

372
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,677
Somebody will clean it up.

373
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:38,453
I don't need your help
or anybody else's, okay?

374
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,656
- Ah.
- Don't. Don't. Don't.

375
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,482
- Yeah. What?
- Give me that.

376
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:46,724
- What do you care?
- They're men now. Good men.

377
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,555
They've earned a right to be on that wall.

378
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:51,334
- How do you know?
- Because they call, okay?

379
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,338
They send me Christmas cards.

380
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,671
They come see me after homecoming.

381
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,778
They find me.

382
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:59,583
Adam Lee, he's a...
He's a banker in New York.

383
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:01,269
Ben Jones is a coach,

384
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,317
and Chad Harper's an artist in the mission.

385
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,053
Lou Tomacino, he's a...

386
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:11,524
He's a fifth grade math teacher.

387
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,684
- So you like the players.
- Course I do.

388
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,534
Why else would I do this?
Not for the money.

389
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,738
I got a car that's older than these kids.

390
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:21,866
Yeah, but you didn't like Rick Riley.

391
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,646
I don't know what you're talking about.

392
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:27,248
- Coach, I saw the video.
- Oh, you saw the video. Wow.

393
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:29,136
Makes you a freaking genius, doesn't it?

394
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,108
Evening.

395
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,211
Thanks for saving my ass this morning.

396
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:53,753
Everybody needs something to sit on.

397
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:54,867
I don't know what I would've done

398
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,603
if you hadn't introduced me
to that fantastic woman.

399
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:02,338
- And that would be?
- Lauren. She's amazing.

400
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:04,370
Lauren?

401
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,509
The blonde? The lawyer?

402
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,170
She's taking care of
everything at no charge.

403
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:14,102
- I'm in very good hands.
- Amazing? Really?

404
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,132
Yeah. And funny and interesting...

405
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,996
And stiff and icy and cold,

406
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:24,709
with the...The... Lauren Reed?

407
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,216
She's great.

408
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:30,438
Anyway, thanks, Kate. Night.

409
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,172
And I'll have the, uh,
New York strip medium

410
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:44,270
and the souffle for dessert.

411
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,094
Takes 20 minutes.

412
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,648
Uh, just the Caesar. Thanks.

413
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,355
So you're probably wondering
what this is all about.

414
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:56,948
- Not really, no.
- Not even curious?

415
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,791
- You need a favor.
- Um...

416
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:02,369
And it has something to do with Kate.

417
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,924
And I'm guessing since her
birthday's coming up...

418
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,343
Okay, all right, all right.
Stop. Okay, let me explain.

419
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,510
Because the fact that you
figured all that out

420
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,737
makes me seem extremely lame.

421
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:11,814
You have absolutely no
idea what to get her.

422
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,519
All right. Stop. Okay?
You figured me out.

423
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,233
Look, when we were married,

424
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:21,417
we had a strict no presents policy, right?

425
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:22,698
We would just do stuff together.

426
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,455
You know, maybe go out for the night.

427
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,447
Whatever. Just making time for each other.
It was great.

428
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,242
- Now we're not married.
- No, you're not.

429
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:34,323
Last month on my birthday,
Kate had this delivered.

430
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:35,928
That's nice.

431
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:37,446
And now I don't know what to do.

432
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:41,473
- You could return the jacket.
- No. Are you kidding me?

433
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,975
Not an option. No.

434
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,023
I want to get her something special.

435
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,022
You spend more time with
her than anybody I know.

436
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:48,415
Can you please help me with this?

437
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,222
What's in it for me?

438
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,382
Well, there's this little jaywalking ticket

439
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:58,880
that keeps bouncing its way
back to your old address.

440
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:02,825
Whoa, hey, know what, I
am here to help you.

441
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,498
Love that about you, Leo.

442
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,467
Yeah. Mmm!

443
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,337
Souffle, huh?

444
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,396
Joe Riley's here with his lawyer.

445
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:22,485
I put him in the conference room

446
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,405
with the insurance rep, a
lawyer from the school.

447
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,695
- Got it. Thanks.
- Hey, quick question.

448
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:29,678
Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong...
If you had to pick one.

449
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,894
First instinct. No wrong answer.

450
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,168
- Mothra.
- Hmm.

451
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,649
Would you describe Lauren as, um, amazing,

452
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,739
funny, or interesting?

453
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,821
- No.
- More like pinched.

454
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,103
Precise. Kind of annoying, right?

455
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:45,821
- That's more in the ballpark.
- That's what I thought.

456
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,396
All right, I'll be in the conference room.

457
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:53,979
Morning. I trust that
everyone's met one another.

458
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:56,331
Mr. Riley. His attorney Robert Kenton.

459
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,264
- Laurie Davidson.
- Ms. Reed.

460
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:57,746
Yes.

461
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,012
Before we begin,

462
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,248
please make it clear to Mr. Kenton

463
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:03,057
that coach Gardner was suspended

464
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,064
at the time of the incident

465
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,901
and, therefore, the school
cannot be held accountable.

466
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:08,689
Please inform Ms. Davidson that suspension

467
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,115
is not termination, and therefore...

468
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:13,208
Okay, suing a school
because a suspended member

469
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,764
of the faculty punched a
guy for egging him on

470
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,685
is not the home run case of the century.

471
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:18,113
Thank you.

472
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:20,892
However, coach Gardner, though suspended,

473
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,780
was still a member of the faculty

474
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:24,365
at the time the incident occurred.

475
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,907
And he did assault a parent
in front of witnesses.

476
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,910
So I'm sure that we can find
a reasonable middle ground.

477
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,582
No, come on, that's ridiculous.

478
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,631
- Joe...
- No. No. No. Come on.

479
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,924
Gardner berated my son, he benched him,

480
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,490
and then he assaulted me.

481
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,019
There's no middle ground.

482
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,969
Uh, Leo, we're in the middle of a meeting.

483
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,765
It's an emergency.

484
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:45,100
Your son collapsed in practice.

485
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,333
He's been rushed to the hospital.

486
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:55,333
Then I'd like to take him home
as soon as possible.

487
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,143
No, doctor, that is not an option.

488
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,048
No, not unless you're telling me...

489
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:01,995
We just walked in.

490
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,876
Okay, fine, I'll meet you there.

491
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:06,925
I gotta go meet the doctor in his office.

492
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:08,774
- Rick is in the recovery.
- I heard.

493
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:11,240
Probably giving him more fluids.
He was dehydrated.

494
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,241
Was that it?

495
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:13,190
Well, I think so.

496
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,232
Doctor's too busy covering his ass
to say anything more specific.

497
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,065
Listen, Kate, I really appreciate you
keeping me company on the way.

498
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:22,757
Oh, sure, sure,
I was more than happy to do that.

499
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:26,576
- Good. - And I guess I'll just reschedule
the mediation for when Rick is feeling better.

500
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,252
- No.
- Mr. Riley, we can make this work.

501
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,352
There's no reason
we have to go to court.

502
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:34,383
You know what,
I'm just gonna drop the whole thing.

503
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:37,364
The mediation, the assault charges,
everything.

504
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,341
Really?
Are you sure about that?

505
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,595
Obviously the stress with this thing
with the coach,

506
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:42,806
is the reason Rick's in the hospital.

507
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:45,246
I'm still ticked at that guy
for what he did to me and my son,

508
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:46,719
but I'm gonna suck it up.

509
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:50,148
Listen, I gotta go
find this doctor's office.

510
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,695
Get my son out of here before he catches
something actually horrible.

511
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,868
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

512
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:57,893
But I didn't really do anything.

513
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:46,035
- Kate.
- Yeah.

514
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:48,739
- How's the assault mediation?
- Um, good, good.

515
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,194
Everything's fine, you know.

516
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:52,003
The dad just decided to drop everything.

517
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,143
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

518
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:54,712
Why are you being nice to my friend?

519
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:58,749
I was better equipped to take the case

520
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,689
and I wanted to know if
your friend, McKinnon,

521
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,994
was related to another McKinnon,
the Australian billionaire.

522
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:10,259
- With a "b"?
- Yes.

523
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,184
Is he?

524
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,281
We do a small favor now,

525
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,186
maybe it pays off for the firm later.

526
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,130
I knew you weren't being nice.

527
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:22,966
Define "nice."

528
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,445
Watching you guys is like
watching those weird

529
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,802
rainforest bird territory dances.

530
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:34,370
Well, who has the better feathers?

531
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,892
Makes me so uncomfortable.

532
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:38,016
Why don't you watch shows
about humans, huh?

533
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:38,927
Touche.

534
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,432
Hey, is this video cued up?

535
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:41,437
Yeah.

536
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:46,865
Heat lamp, electric blanket,
or thermal underwear?

537
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,609
Electric blanket.

538
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,079
Leo, any more of these triptychs

539
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,824
and I'm gonna have to
ask for an explanation.

540
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,141
- I'll give you three.
- Cute!

541
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:59,313
You're too stupid to look at your watch

542
00:25:59,314 --> 00:25:59,904
and get here on time,

543
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,981
you're too stupid to play
on my team, you hear me?

544
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:03,419
Now, when you get your head out of your ass

545
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,564
and start acting like a
man, then you can play!

546
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:08,595
Watch and get here on time,

547
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,564
you're too stupid to play
on my team, you hear me?

548
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:11,891
Now, when you get your head out of your ass

549
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:13,751
and start acting like a
man, then you can play!

550
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,497
- Hey, Leo.
- Yep?

551
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,073
Can you come in here for a second?

552
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:21,846
Does this kid seem scared to you?

553
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,650
You're too stupid to play
on my team, you hear me?

554
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:26,578
Not "there's an angry, muscular man

555
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,551
spitting in my face" kind of scared, no.

556
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,008
Till then, you sit down and shut up!

557
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:36,432
Hey, look, the kid says something.

558
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,023
Where?

559
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:38,528
It's after the coach stops talking.

560
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,437
Thanks, Leo.

561
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:51,747
Rick. Hi. Kate Reed.

562
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,720
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

563
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,497
- How are you?
- I guess I'm doing okay.

564
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,352
That's good.

565
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:59,775
Hey, listen, I rewatched that video

566
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,216
of coach Gardner benching you.

567
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,529
Look, um, my dad's just
filling out some forms.

568
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,146
He's gonna be back in here in a second.

569
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:10,934
Okay. I was just wondering
what was it that you said

570
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,654
after he stopped yelling at you?

571
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,886
I don't know. Nothing.

572
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:20,907
Really? Because it looked
like you said "thank you."

573
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,581
Kate, look, I really

574
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:25,726
don't feel like talking right now, okay?

575
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,264
Okay. Okay.

576
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,475
You know what doesn't make sense

577
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:32,676
in this situation?

578
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:37,307
That you would get reamed

579
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,502
in front of all of your football friends

580
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,045
and then say "thank you."

581
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:48,389
So man up. The truth, Rick.

582
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,101
What's going on with you and coach Gardner?

583
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,197
He caught me doing steroids.

584
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,244
It was just a stupid mistake.

585
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:01,051
But if anyone found out, I'd
get kicked out of school.

586
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,792
And there'd be no way that
I could get a scholarship

587
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:04,881
to college.

588
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,740
So I begged him not to turn me in.

589
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:11,452
And then the yelling,

590
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:13,853
that was... that was all just a show?

591
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:15,808
Yeah...I promised to stop

592
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,673
when he said that he'd just bench me

593
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:20,385
until the stuff left my system.

594
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,268
I don't want any pissant excuses, Riley!

595
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:36,677
If you're too stupid to look at your watch

596
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:37,710
and get here on time,

597
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,450
you're too stupid to play on my team!

598
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,907
Now, when you get your head out of your ass

599
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:42,138
and start acting like a man,

600
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,634
then you can come back on the team!

601
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,652
Till then, you sit down and shut up!

602
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,667
Thank you, coach.

603
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,159
Coach was just being nice.

604
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:57,736
Yeah. He was being awfully nice.

605
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,011
So is that it?

606
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:02,457
I don't know. Is it?

607
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,117
Nobody's making any sense, you know?

608
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,312
I just... it just doesn't
make any sense to me.

609
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,609
What doesn't make any sense?

610
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,485
The icing rules of hockey.

611
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:14,547
I just don't get it.

612
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:16,979
I mean, you've got the...
it was the blue line, right?

613
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,651
It's not really my... not my game.

614
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,768
So you're just hanging around the hospital?

615
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,729
I was just visiting a friend of mine

616
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,938
and I thought I'd see if
you guys were still here.

617
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,276
Yeah. Uh, I signed you out, bud.

618
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:32,616
Let's go.

619
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:35,953
- Bye, Rick.
- Kate.

620
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:01,283
You caused me a lot of trouble.

621
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:02,993
I didn't make you punch that guy.

622
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:06,124
- Honey, who is it?
- It's that mediator.

623
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,994
- Invite her in.
- Yes, please.

624
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:14,180
So why didn't you tell me
he was taking steroids?

625
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:15,865
He's a good kid.

626
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:19,245
He made one giant mistake.

627
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,505
I couldn't bring myself to ruin his future

628
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:24,011
by having that on his record.

629
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,553
Coach, with all due respect, you're lying.

630
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:31,436
You know, you and I,

631
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,276
we're never gonna see eye to eye on this.

632
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:34,813
We're not. We're not.

633
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,511
You went through the trouble
of screaming at him,

634
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:40,192
benching him, all so that
nobody would find out

635
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,218
he was taking steroids,

636
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,883
but then you get suspended

637
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,428
and you still don't say anything?

638
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:49,044
Last year, the basketball coach

639
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,022
turned a kid in.

640
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,111
He got kicked off the team.

641
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,172
Was never much of a student, that kid.

642
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,084
But without the structure of practice,

643
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:03,629
without the team, he fell apart.

644
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:05,993
Dropped out.

645
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:07,700
So you thought you could handle things

646
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:08,901
better than the system?

647
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:12,386
No, the team is the system. And it works.

648
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:15,931
We've been turning boys
into men for decades.

649
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:18,114
Yeah, but you can't do
that all by yourself.

650
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,189
I tried to call Rick's
father over and over,

651
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:23,670
but he wouldn't talk to me.

652
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,511
- So then you just decked him?
- I have good reason.

653
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,291
Here, I got something for you.

654
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,277
Keep 'em somewhere safe, all right?

655
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:41,758
- Give me that bottle.
- What?

656
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,778
- Give me that bottle.
- Coach, it's nothing.

657
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,187
What, are you kidding me? Come here.

658
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:47,766
You taking steroids is bad enough,

659
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,067
but your father dealing to you?

660
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:51,021
- Coach, it's not like that.
- Shut up, Rick!

661
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm not going to stand by, you hear me?

662
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,999
I'm not going to stand by
and have this kind of...

663
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,536
What's going on here?

664
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:00,018
So by the time I found out

665
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:03,091
that Rick was getting
steroids from his father,

666
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:05,081
I'd already been suspended from coaching.

667
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:06,879
So that's why Joe was so eager

668
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,448
to get Rick out of the hospital.

669
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,803
He didn't want the doctors to find out

670
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,211
what he was giving to his son.

671
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:15,301
Have you called child services?

672
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,180
Not yet.

673
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,567
Look, they'd yank him out of his home.

674
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:21,332
I went to the hospital to find out

675
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,782
if he had any relatives he could stay with

676
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,269
while this thing was getting sorted out,

677
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,702
but it turns out, no,
they're all back east.

678
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,632
I feel like I let him down.

679
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,759
Poor kid's all alone.

680
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:34,779
No, he's not.

681
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:40,484
Okay, I asked Kate to choose

682
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,221
between Mothra, Godzilla, and Kong.

683
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:44,532
And she picked Mothra.

684
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:45,439
What are you talking about?

685
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,560
Her other answers were electric blanket,

686
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:48,894
corduroy, and plutonium.

687
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:49,903
Are you kidding me?

688
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,869
It all adds up to the perfect gift.

689
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:52,945
Which is what?

690
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:55,839
A monster with a radioactive blanket

691
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,978
that makes a noise when you rub against it?

692
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,605
- An iPad.
- Excuse me?

693
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,360
Kate's answers confirm what
we already know about her.

694
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,007
She's a woman with a million interests

695
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,103
and the attention span of a cocker spaniel.

696
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:10,104
Plus they're really cool
and everybody wants one.

697
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,071
I can't believe I let you
scam a meal from me.

698
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:14,185
Hey, if you got a better idea,

699
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:17,366
I invite you to go down in flames with it.

700
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,487
Well...

701
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,181
Didn't think so.

702
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,169
I'll tell you what, give
me your credit card

703
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,027
and I'll go pick one up.

704
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,525
And I'll wrap it too.
I'm one-stop shopping.

705
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:30,909
Fine.

706
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:39,467
Yeah. Come in.

707
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:41,683
Am I disturbing you?

708
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,885
Oh, Mr. McKinnon. Sorry, Andrew.

709
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,694
Yeah, no, please, please. Come in.

710
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,731
- These are for you.
- Oh.

711
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:56,791
They're lovely.

712
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,564
Uh, Mr. McKinnon... Andrew...

713
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:05,821
Just so we're clear,

714
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:08,659
as much as I enjoyed working
together the other day,

715
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:09,844
I'm in the middle of...

716
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:11,268
You wouldn't take any payment

717
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,436
for your services.

718
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:15,166
The flowers are my way of saying thanks.

719
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,751
Well, thank you.

720
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,633
I'll be seeing you, Lauren.

721
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,681
Yeah. Pleasure doing
business with you, Andrew.

722
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,518
Yeah.

723
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,425
Thank you again. They're really beautiful.

724
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:43,665
Mr. Riley. Hi.
Thanks so much for coming in.

725
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:45,992
Uh, we're gonna go right back
into the conference room.

726
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:46,922
Okay.

727
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:50,468
Not quite sure what we
have left to talk about.

728
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,637
You know, it's just some paperwork,

729
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,148
formalities, minor stuff.

730
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,780
You will be out of here in no time.

731
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:57,030
All right.

732
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,135
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

733
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:06,615
Mr. Riley, I would like for
you to meet judge Nicastro.

734
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:07,852
Why is there a judge here?

735
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:10,582
Oh, he's just kind of an
agent of the court thing.

736
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,082
- Right, judge?
- Correct.

737
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,074
Have a seat.

738
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,916
Now, the beauty of a mediation
versus a court trial

739
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:20,518
is that in mediation, both
sides come out winners.

740
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,049
But in order to get those
really good outcomes,

741
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,603
you've got to make some concessions.

742
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:25,878
Concessions.

743
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,062
Here's what you're going to do.

744
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:28,238
You are going to write a letter

745
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,530
on behalf of the other parents
to the school district

746
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,968
insisting that coach Gardner be rehired.

747
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:36,793
And then...You're going to sign this.

748
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:41,552
Uh...You know what?
I'm not going to sit here...

749
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,865
You provided steroids to a minor,
Mr. Riley...

750
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:49,305
your son... in direct violation
of school policy and the law.

751
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:52,612
A felony. Open the envelope.

752
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:59,967
Your son will live with coach Gardner

753
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:02,254
and his wife for the remainder
of the school year.

754
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:05,487
He will be tested regularly
to make sure that he's clean.

755
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:08,764
You will enter a counseling program

756
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:09,712
of my choosing.

757
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:11,875
As long as you remain in that program,

758
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,534
you will have supervised
visitation with your son.

759
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:18,707
And you sign those documents
and you get a concession too.

760
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:22,401
And what's that?

761
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:24,275
We don't have you throw in jail.

762
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:44,925
Wow. Couldn't have be easy for Joe Riley

763
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,494
to give me temporary custody, huh?

764
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,760
Well, he liked it better
than his alternative.

765
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:52,414
Are you sure you're okay with him
coming to dinner every night?

766
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:53,603
Oh, yeah. I think it's good.

767
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:54,827
Boy needs to see his father

768
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:57,718
and Joe Riley needs to
learn to act like a man.

769
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,261
Little adult supervision
wouldn't hurt that.

770
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,458
No. I talked to Rick, you know,

771
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,715
and he seems pretty happy about it.

772
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:05,768
Yeah, he is.

773
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,936
- I think he's relieved.
- Yeah.

774
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:14,490
So how's your suspension coming along?

775
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,820
Oh, it's great.
Assistant coach is doing great.

776
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:18,585
It's relaxing, really, you know,

777
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:19,630
just to be an observer.

778
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:20,763
Yeah, I like it.

779
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:23,469
Come on, Clark! Pretend you're alive!

780
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,554
- It's like a vacation.
- Yeah.

781
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:28,547
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

782
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,905
Well, you finally got what you wanted.

783
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,507
Which is what?

784
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,868
You thought that the
parents were the problem,

785
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:37,564
and now you get to coach one of them too.

786
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:40,800
Whaley, come on!

787
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,657
You call that getting off the line?

788
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:23,415
Hi, Kate.

789
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:27,261
One day early? I am impressed.

790
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,816
Do you like it?

791
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,459
Justin, I love it. It's perfect.

792
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,738
Ah, you know, we've known
each other a long time.

793
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,226
Yeah, but still.

794
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,685
I mean, a boat toaster's a
little off the beaten path.

795
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:41,922
A boat toaster.

796
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,929
It might be the best present
you have ever given me.

797
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:50,295
Well, you know, I just, uh, had a feeling.

798
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,820
You know, I really like our new tradition.

799
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:56,632
What, you getting me something
beautiful like a coat,

800
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,737
and me getting you something
practical like a boat toaster?

801
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,032
No. Like, you put thought into it.

802
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,625
You know?
And we never used to try that hard.

803
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,723
Well, I'm glad you like it.

804
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,878
Listen, let me call you right back, okay?

805
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:12,061
Okay.

806
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,055
Kate Reed's office.

807
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:21,065
Where's my iPad, Leo?

808
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,778
She loves her toaster.

809
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,586
- Where's the iPad?
- It's my fee.

810
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,324
What are you talking about?

811
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,321
The boat toaster costs, like, ten bucks.

812
00:39:30,322 --> 00:39:31,955
Yes, but she loves it.

813
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,129
How did you know she was gonna love it?

814
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:38,162
Well, Justin, Kate's a busy professional

815
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,698
with impeccable taste.

816
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:43,013
Plus she lives on a boat and loves toast.

817
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,473
Can't argue with that.
Good-bye, Leonardo.

818
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,704
Good-bye, Justin.

819
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,246
Hey, Leo, can you get me some bread?

820
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,848
