1
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,147
-You wanna go faster?
-All right. No, no, no.

2
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,947
You're gonna slide off.

3
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:19,720
-You all right? Are you sliding?
-Yeah.

4
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,792
lf you're sliding, l'm gonna sto you.

5
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,361
-No, no, no.
-You're okay? Okay.

6
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:30,432
-More?
-Yes.

7
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,225
That's funny.

8
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:05,736
l could've sworn l saw a little girl
by the name of Emily come in here.

9
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,138
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

10
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:13,745
Could she be hiding in the closet?

11
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,685
l wonder where she could be.

12
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,460
Maybe my eyes have deceived me.

13
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,792
l'm invisible, Mommy.

14
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:38,362
Well, if you're invisible...

15
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,269
...then how could l do this?

16
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,009
-Did you know where l was?
-Not a clue.

17
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,945
You want Alex?

18
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,853
What is it?

19
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,891
l love you more than
anything else in the world.

20
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:12,571
You know that, don't you?

21
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,237
l love you too.

22
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,118
Good night, sweetheart.

23
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,482
Make the face.

24
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:31,347
Please.

25
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,895
-Now go to slee.
-Okay.

26
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,740
Mommy.

27
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,104
Sorry.

28
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,379
Good night.

29
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:12,095
You coming to bed?

30
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,857
ln a little while.

31
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,370
Something you wanna talk about?

32
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,808
Some things are beyond theray, David.

33
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,068
Honey?

34
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,082
<i>Dr. Roberts, extension 2032.</i>

35
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,762
l should've seen it coming.

36
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,526
All the signs were there.

37
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,600
The ones closest to you
are the hardest to judge.

38
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,603
l know, but l....

39
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,641
-l could've revented it.
-David, it's not your fault.

40
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:14,046
How long have we known each other?

41
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,573
Trust me when l tell you this.

42
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,186
As difficult as it may seem...

43
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:23,322
...you're gonna have to
try and start over.

44
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,486
We're gonna move.

45
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,291
Ustate. The country.

46
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,230
That's not exactly what l meant
by starting over.

47
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,004
What about Emily?

48
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,872
This is a traumatic time for her.

49
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,235
lt's imortant she stays
and works through this.

50
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,843
No, here she's flooded with memories.

51
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:50,073
l need to exose her to
a new environment, new things to do.

52
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,343
She'd be losing another erson
she deends on.

53
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:59,925
lt's only an hour away, and you're
always welcome to come and see her.

54
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,096
Right now, l need to do
what's right for Emily.

55
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,823
l need to be a full-time dad.

56
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,333
l have a surrise for you.

57
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,348
When l was your age,
my mom gave me one just like that.

58
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,319
And whenever l was feeling sad,
l would oen the lid...

59
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:40,363
...and all my sorrows went away.

60
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,495
Do you like it?

61
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:45,632
Give me a hug.

62
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,244
You're gonna like it there.

63
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,779
All right, let's go.

64
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,579
Come on. Let's take a look.

65
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,115
Right on time.

66
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:19,187
Dr. Callaway.

67
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:21,452
-Mr. Haskins.
-Hello.

68
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,424
-This is Sheriff Hafferty.
-Sheriff.

69
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,327
He routinely checks on the houses u here
and makes sure things run smoothly.

70
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,594
l see. Well, this is my daughter, Emily.
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

71
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:34,607
Emily. How are you?

72
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:38,544
This is Mr. Haskins.
He found us the house.

73
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, hello there, Emily.

74
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,781
Think your dad did a good job
icking the house?

75
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:48,984
She's still deciding.

76
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,254
-Well, she sure is retty.
-Thank you.

77
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:59,361
As l mentioned, Woodland Estates
is mainly a summer community.

78
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:02,729
lt may be a little quiet u here till then.
l hoe that's not a roblem.

79
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:06,303
-Not at all.
-Great. Let me show you around the back.

80
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,267
-You ever sent much time in the country?
-Not much.

81
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:15,244
l used to cam when l was little,
but l was always scared of the woods.

82
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:18,543
Nothing to be scared of in these woods.

83
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,687
You icked a nice sot,
the biggest house on the lake.

84
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:27,850
Sheriff, if you'd like to do the honors,
let Dr. Callaway into his new home.

85
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:32,327
-Figure out which key.
-Did you see where my daughter went?

86
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,695
Emily.

87
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,800
Emily.

88
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,306
Emily!

89
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:57,184
Honey, you okay?

90
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,321
Come on, let's go back. Come on.

91
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,894
Come on.

92
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:14,632
Mr. Haskins, sheriff,
we'll take it from here.

93
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:31,987
Saghetti and meatballs
is your favorite dish.

94
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:33,921
You're not hungry?

95
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,504
l'd like to go to bed now.

96
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,854
l'll come u and kiss you good night.

97
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,430
Oh, that's funny.

98
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:21,403
l could've sworn l saw a little girl
by the name of Emily come in here.

99
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,008
l wonder...

100
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,770
...where she's hiding.

101
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,608
Could she be...?

102
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:32,751
Could she be under the bed?

103
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,443
No.

104
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:37,248
Could she be...

105
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,953
...hiding...?

106
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:47,100
Let's see, where could she be hiding?
Could she be hiding in the closet?

107
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,810
Okay.

108
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,279
Since it's the first night
in a new house...

109
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:11,252
...l thought it would be a good time
to start a new diary.

110
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:14,450
Each day you can write down
your feelings and thoughts...

111
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:18,859
...and then one day you can look back
and see how much they've changed.

112
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,698
l love you more than anything else
in the world, sweetheart.

113
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,064
You know that.

114
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,841
That's what Mommy said.

115
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,608
Before she killed herself.

116
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:45,958
Sweetheart, she meant what she said,
and so do l.

117
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:52,089
You want me to ut this over here?

118
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,992
Okay.

119
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,065
All right.

120
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,106
Good night.

121
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,682
Good night, Alex.

122
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,325
Emily?

123
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,761
Emily.

124
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:11,027
Em?

125
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,104
Emily?

126
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,009
Oh, there you are.

127
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:26,913
Come on, sweetheart. We're going
into town. We have some errands to do.

128
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:36,353
-Hello.

00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,930
-Here, these are for you.
-Oh, thank you very much.

132
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,971
My husband and l

133
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:52,338
Oh, well. l didn't even realize
anyone else lived u here.

134
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,740
Well, it does get retty quiet
in the off-season.

135
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,650
Oh, this is my daughter, Emily.

136
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,821

She's our neighbor.

137

You gonna say hi?

139
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,586
Well, she gets a little shy
around new faces.

140
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,458
l understand.

141
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,531

Amy? Jesus, are you all right?

166
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:22,826
That's very funny. Oh, my God,

167
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,831

-Where's Alex?
-l don't like her anymore.

169
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,208
Did l just hear what l think l heard?

170
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,819
-Are you mad, Daddy?
-No, l'm not mad at all. l think it's great.

Good. Because l have a new friend.

173
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:58,587
A new friend? Okay.

He. Okay, well...

180
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,244
...if he's not a doll, then who is he?

181
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,083
He doesn't want me to talk about him.

182
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,885
-Doesn't want you to talk about him?
-No.

183
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:30,858
What if l romise to kee it a secret,
could you tell me then?

184
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,229
So, what's his name?

185
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,733
He told me to call him Charlie.

186
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,073
Charlie. Oh, that's an interesting name.

187
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:46,211
Charlie.

188
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:48,573
-When did you meet Charlie?
-Today.

189
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:50,609
When we went to town?

190
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:52,982
lt was before that.

191
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,714
Before that?

192
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,481

l think he's sleeing.

195
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:14,167
Okay. Well, in that case,
we better not wake him.

196
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,233
<i>Its not unusual for a traumatized child</i>
<i>to create imaginary friends.</i>

197
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:23,643
l know. l just wish she'd confide in me
instead of using fantasy.

198
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,715
Trauma causes ain.

199
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,512
Eventually, the mind will find
a way to release it.

200
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:31,485
No kidding. Don't forget l'm the one
who taught you that stuff.

201
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,659
As a matter of fact, you did, yes.

202

<i>Just have fun with her, David,</i>
<i>play with her.</i>

203

That's what she needs.

204
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:19,132
These are beginning rods.

205
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,006
Let's see.

206
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:29,909
Two rods, 41 .50 each.

207
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,244
Times it by two.

208
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,680
Okay, that's 41 .50.

209
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:41,158
41 .50 times two.

Could you give me a break? l didn't realize.

214

Enjoy your day.

215
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,254
So much for

-Shut the door.
-We broke the law.

217
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,397
l know we broke the law. Shut the door.

218
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,341
-Maybe the Loch Ness monster.
-What?

219
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:33,409
You know what that is?

220
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:36,138
lt's in Scotland.

221
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,416
This is a good sot, huh?

222
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,838
Honey, what are you doing?

223
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:13,777
Do you think that's a good idea?

224
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:18,547
Emily?

225
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,658
We have bait.

226
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,421
See?

227
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,969
All right.

228
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:35,638
Did you have a nice time today?

229
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,274
lt was okay.

230
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,910
Just okay?

231
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:43,479
Well, then, what could we have done
to make it better?

232
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:50,553
What if Charlie was there?
Would he make it better?

233
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:55,518
-He's a lot of fun.
-Fun like how?

234
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:00,893
Fun like Mommy.

235
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,909
lt's a little stuffy in here.

236

There's nobody here but us.

242

lt wasn't me.

243
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,440
This is your writing,
and these are your crayons, honey.

244
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,184
lt's all right, just tell me.
You don't have to lie.

245
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,645
l'm not lying.

246
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,553
Okay, well, if you didn't do it,
then who did?

247
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,524
lt was Charlie.

248
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,736
She thinks l'm resonsible
for Alison's death.

249
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,908
<i>Its Charlie that holds you responsible.</i>

250
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,245
Use him, David.
Use him to get through to her.

251

So is that your wife?

l'm sorry.

268
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:15,651
No matter how many times l say it,
it still sounds so strange.

269
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:17,446
Must be hard on Emily.

270
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:22,156
-Have you ever been married?
-Actually, l just got divorced.

l'm living with my sister and her husband
till l can figure out my next move.

272
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:33,467
Best way to get over the ast
is to start something new.

273

That's why we're here.

And you don't talk much, do you?

283
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,279
You shouldn't be here.

Why not?

285
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,314
You could get hurt.

As far as l'm concerned,

What l'm saying is, it's very imortant
for you to listen when l tell you something.

323
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:40,882
-Okay.
-Okay?

324
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,556
What are you doing, sweetheart?

325
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,054
-Nothing.
-What's so funny?

326
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,626
-ls Charlie here?
-He just left.

327
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:32,303
Where'd he go?

328
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:42,076
Did you oen that?

329
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,215
l thought you did.

330
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,684
-l wanna talk to Charlie.
-What would you like to talk about?

331
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:25,789
l'd like to talk to him
about all sorts of things.

332
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:28,824
-Like what?
-Like, well....

333
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:32,888
What makes him hay,
what makes him sad.

334
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,126
So, what do you say,
you think you can introduce us?

335
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,533
l don't think that's gonna work.

336
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,674
-Why is that?
-He doesn't like you very much.

337
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:46,808
Why doesn't he like me very much?

338
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,541
Does it have something
to do with Mommy?

339
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:53,451
Honey...

340
00:37:56,288 --> 00:37:57,880
...what does he tell you?

341
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:22,404
Three-1 000, four-1 000,
five-1 000...

342
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:27,381
...six-1 000, seven-1 000,
eight-1 000...

343
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:30,851
...nine-1 000, 1 0-1 000.

344
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:35,084
Ready or not, here l come.

345
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,581
Charlie.

346
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,454
Charlie.

347
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,641
Charlie.

348
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:41,756
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

349
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:55,927
Charlie, is that you?

350
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:04,805
Emily.

351
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,506
Emily.

352
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,015
Daddy!

353
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,250
Emily!

354
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,758
Where are you?

355
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,832
What haened?
Why are you down here?

356
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,264
Emily, talk to me.

357
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,903
-He was hiding.
-Who was hiding?

358
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,231
ln the dark.

359
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,346
Can l go to bed now?

360
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:08,232
-Hi.
-Hi.

361
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:10,569
Do you have a minute?

362
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,475
Yeah, sure, come on in.

363
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:15,472
Thank you.

364
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:23,683
l wanted to aologize for my husband.

365
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:28,052
He said he had an awkward moment
yesterday with you and Emily.

366
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,627
-lt's all right. Don't worry about it.
-He's harmless. Wouldn't hurt a fly.

367
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:33,761
That's fine.

368
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:39,765
lt's just that we lost
a child recently, a girl.

369
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:44,666
ln some ways,
Emily reminds us of her.

370
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:47,577
l see.

371
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,908
He was just reaching out.

372
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:59,287
There is nothing worse in this world
than losing a child.

373
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:46,962
Here, taste this.
l think it may be too salty.

374
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,802
Okay.

375
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:51,937
-Not bad.
-Really?

376
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:53,770
-Not bad.
-Oh, good.

377
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:55,411
lt's really good.

378
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:00,974
Wow, you look so retty.

379
00:44:02,654 --> 00:44:05,214
You didn't have to get
all dressed u for me.

380
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:09,086
Honey, would you go ustairs
and change into something else,please?

381
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:11,518
Don't you like it?

382
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,860
Not for dinner, no.

383
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,623
Why not?

384
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:17,564
You know why.

385
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:20,260
She looks so retty. Let's just eat.

386
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:22,497
l think you look really beautiful.

387
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,686
Did Daddy tell you
that my mommy died?

388
00:44:43,628 --> 00:44:45,061
Yes, he did.

389
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,921
-And l'm very sorry.
-Did he tell you how she died?

390
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:52,433
Honey, l don't think Elizabeth really
wants to hear how that haened, okay?

391
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:54,537
-She killed herself in our bathtub.
-Emily.

392
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,900
-She slit her wrists with a razor.
-Emily.

393
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,471
That's enough.

394
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,943
Emily, l brought you something.

395
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:12,515
Your dad asked me to bring over
some of Amy's books.

396
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:15,420
These were some of my favorites
when l was your age.

397
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:17,322
Oh, that's great.

398
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,061
Give you a chance to see what the other
kids are reading before you get started.

399
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:24,792
You gonna say thanks?

400
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,240
Emily.

401
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:34,808
Emily.

402
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,446
Emily, sto it. That's enough.

403
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,240
-Do you like her, Daddy?
-Sto this.

404
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,747
-Charlie says you do.
-Go to your room.

405
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:42,647
-He says you like her as much as Mommy.
-Go to your room.

406
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,015
lf you're gonna behave this way,
go to your room.

407
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:48,685
Let's hoe you don't
wind u like her.

408
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:02,563
l'm sorry.

409
00:46:02,974 --> 00:46:06,842
-Who's Charlie?
-He's her imaginary friend.

410
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:09,310
Her only friend.

411
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:17,652
l always wanted her
to have a better childhood than l had.

412
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:21,082
Now look.

413
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:27,324
Drive safely.

414
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,089
Attention, lease.

415
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,259
Maybe after a few more martinis.

416
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:25,912
Charlie did it.

417
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:28,816
You do believe me, don't you, Daddy?

418
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:30,745
Why are you looking at me like that?

419
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:53,766
Dr. Callaway,
l didn't mean to disturb you.

420
00:48:56,014 --> 00:48:58,039
l thought you might be needing these.

421
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:10,754
Those are the keys
for the different rooms in the house.

422
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,659
l forgot to give them to you earlier.
l aologize.

423
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:19,365
lt's a little late to be
delivering keys, isn't it?

424
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,329
Well, l thought l could
sli them under the door.

425
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:26,900
Wife and l are going to Canada
first thing in the morning.

426
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:30,846
We've got a little cabin
tucked away in the woods.

427
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,876
Good lace to clear the mind.

428
00:49:36,888 --> 00:49:39,015
Everything all right?

429
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,928
Well, enjoy.

430
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:36,475
What's for breakfast?

431
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:52,959
Honey, why would Charlie do
such a horrible thing?

432
00:50:57,802 --> 00:50:59,235
ls it because of Elizabeth?

433
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,899
Charlie needs to
understand something, honey.

434
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:08,203
Elizabeth is not trying
to take Mommy's lace.

435
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:10,706
Does he understand that?

436
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:15,308
Honey, l can't hel you
if you don't talk to me.

437
00:51:18,556 --> 00:51:20,353
Why doesn't he like Elizabeth?

438
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,917
Because she likes you.

439
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:27,428
-And?
-He doesn't want you to be hay.

440
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:32,326
Honey...

441
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:36,872
...you know this has nothing to do
with Charlie. You do know that.

442
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:42,075
lt's about you, honey, and that's okay.

443
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:46,177
Charlie doesn't exist.

444
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,979
-You shouldn't say that.
-Why not?

445
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:54,215
You're gonna make him mad.

446
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:58,123
Well, so what? l'll get him mad.

447
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:02,391
Let him come out and yell at me.
Good, l wanna see him. Where is he?

448
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,795
You wanna see him?

449
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:27,247
Who's that suosed to be?

450
00:52:27,992 --> 00:52:31,155
Charlie and Mommy.
She would've liked him.

451
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:36,224
No, trust me, honey.
Mommy wouldn't like Charlie.

452
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:38,936
That's not what he says.

453
00:52:43,808 --> 00:52:45,503
What do you mean?

454
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:49,975
What do you mean? What does he say?

455
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:52,511
What does he say?

456
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,752
What does Charlie say? Talk to me.
What does he say?

457
00:52:57,054 --> 00:52:59,352
He says he would've satisfied her.

458
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:05,087
-Who told you to say that?
-Charlie did.

459
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:08,265
-No, who told you that?
-Charlie did.

460
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:11,196
-There is no Charlie. Who said it?
-Charlie did!

461
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:14,860
-He did not. Who said it?
-Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

462
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:20,667
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

463
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:30,010
Hey.

464
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:34,553
-Hey, sweetheart.
-l'm so hay you came.

465
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,454
lt's so good to see you.

466
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,358
-Wanna show me the house? Okay.
-Yeah.

467
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,899
-Hey, David. How are you?
-Good. Good to see you.

468
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:49,902
-Good to see you too.
-Glad you could come.

469
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:54,636
Do you like it here?

470
00:53:55,413 --> 00:53:57,074
l'm having a lot of fun.

471
00:53:57,715 --> 00:53:59,239
You are?

472
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:03,378
Tell me about your friend Charlie.

473
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:07,288
He doesn't like me to talk about him.

474
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:10,122
l'm sure he wouldn't mind
if you told me.

475
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:15,295
So tell me,
what do you guys do together?

476
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,859
-Play games.
-What kind of games?

477
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:23,031
Hide-and-seek. That's our favorite.

478
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:27,206
Sounds like Charlie's a lot of fun.

479
00:54:31,983 --> 00:54:34,816
-So, what do you guys talk about?
-l don't know.

480
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:36,577
Bunch of things.

481
00:54:38,022 --> 00:54:40,616
Sometimes he even talks about you.

482
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,627
Really?

483
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:46,988
And what does he say?

484
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,826
You can tell me.

485
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,201
He's afraid you're gonna
get in the way.

486
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,337
ln the-- ln the way of what?

487
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,841
Our game.

488
00:55:01,946 --> 00:55:03,243
What game is that?

489
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:06,247
Usetting Daddy.

490
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:12,489
lsn't she retty?

491
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:17,993
<i>David, Id like to bring</i>
<i>Emily back with me.</i>

492
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:20,527
At least for a little while,
so she can be evaluated.

493
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,862
l'm just worried bringing her back
will make her worse.

494
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:26,536
She's not well.

495
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:29,103
-l know that.
-And she's not your atient.

496
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:32,166
l know that too.

497
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,903
She thinks it's a game.
She's using Charlie to get to you.

498
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:39,708
l know things haven't gone
as well as we hoed...

499
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:43,114
...but do you think bringing her back
to New York will make a difference?

500
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,787
lt's worth a try.

501
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:51,226
All right, look,
l'll give it two more weeks...

502
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:53,795
...and if there's no imrovement,
l'll bring her back.

503
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:42,328
-What are you doing, Daddy?
-Nothing.

504
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,602
-What were you looking at?
-No, l was just getting ready to tuck you in.

505
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:01,952
Good night.

506
00:58:11,302 --> 00:58:12,530
Daddy?

507
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:16,270
Yes, sweetheart?

508
00:58:16,707 --> 00:58:18,402
Can you close the door?

509
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,307
-You don't want the light?
-l don't need it anymore.

510
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,248
Okay.

511
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:59,035
Hi.

512
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,138

Oh, thank you.

515
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:11,882

518
01:00:57,735 --> 01:01:00,863
You must think we're retty crazy,
keeing all these toys around.

519
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:05,869
lt's....

520
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:10,243
lt's hard to find the right lace
for them, you know?

521
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,558
l'm sorry.

522
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:25,525
No, you have nothing to be sorry about.

523
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:29,756
lt's just l've had no one to talk to.

524
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:32,762
You know that l am a sychologist.

525
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:37,066
l've dealt with many eole
in similar circumstances...

526
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:41,768
...and if you and your husband would like
to talk about this, it might hel.

527
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:46,575
He's been having a tough time
this ast coule of weeks.

528
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:51,782
ln what sense?

529
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:57,182
You have no idea how ainful it can be...

530
01:01:57,394 --> 01:02:00,852
...how ainful he can make it.

531
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,735

532
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,767

Emily, are you in here?

544
01:03:59,116 --> 01:04:00,845
Didn't you hear me calling?

545
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:03,550
Daddy's not here.

546
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:07,117
Well, actually, it was you
that l came to see.

547
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:11,886
Would you mind if we
talked for a moment?

548
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:18,227
l brought you some daisies.

549
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:24,901
l wasn't sure which one was your
favorite color, so l just got all kinds.

550
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:29,939
Thanks.

551
01:04:34,718 --> 01:04:38,119
Emily, l'm really sorry about
what haened the other night.

552
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:42,088
l want you to know that l'm not trying
to come between you and your dad.

553
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,657
Do you think maybe we could start over?

554
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:48,763
We could be friends?

555
01:04:50,601 --> 01:04:52,228
Do you like games?

556
01:04:52,903 --> 01:04:54,996
l love games.

557
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:58,638
Would you like to lay one?

558
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:01,468
l'm already laying.

559
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:05,407
And what game are you laying?

560
01:05:06,049 --> 01:05:07,949
Hide-and-seek.

561
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:12,515
Don't you need another erson
to lay that game?

562
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,588
He's hiding.

563
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,056
Who's hiding?

564
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:20,357
Charlie.

565
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:24,998
Charlie's hiding.

566
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:26,832
Where is he hiding?

567
01:05:41,852 --> 01:05:43,649
You stay here.

568
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:49,291
Charlie.

569
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:52,621
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

570
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:55,759
No, no.

571
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:15,081

What are you doing?

574
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:05,765
What are you drawing, honey?

575
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:25,913

576
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:29,087
Emily, what haened?

577
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,346
Oh, hello, sheriff.

578
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:53,239
You mind if l come in for a minute?

579
01:07:58,455 --> 01:08:01,253
Afraid l have some bad news.
There's been an accident.

580
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:04,489
l found Elizabeth Young's car
crashed on the side of the road.

581
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:08,494
-ls she okay?
-l don't know. She wasn't inside.

582
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:10,529
l soke to her niece, Amy.

583
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:13,862
She told me she came u here
to see you. You seen her?

584
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,664
No, l haven't seen her. No.

585
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,941
Would you mind if...

586
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,302
...l had a glass of water?

587
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:25,242
Sure. Just what, water...?

588
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:27,780
-Yeah.
-Sure.

589
01:08:33,056 --> 01:08:36,890
At first l thought she might've
crashed on the way u.

590
01:08:40,697 --> 01:08:41,959
But taking a second look...

591
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:46,498
...l seen the tire tracks
leading down the hill.

592
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:51,167
So she must've at least stoed by.

593
01:08:52,776 --> 01:08:56,234
Well, maybe she forgot something,
or turned around, or l don't know, but--

594
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:59,210
Maybe.... Maybe Emily's seen her.

595
01:09:00,317 --> 01:09:02,911
No, that couldn't be.
Emily was here, ustairs.

596
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,111
-Could you call her?
-Sure.

597
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:08,791
l can call her, yeah. l could ask her.

598
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:10,516

Come on down. Come on.

603
01:09:25,108 --> 01:09:26,939
Hello, Emily.
