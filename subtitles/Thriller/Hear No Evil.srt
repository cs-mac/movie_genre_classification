1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,867


2
00:00:04,646 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>Events and characters that appear in this drama are fictional.</i>

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,762
Aish. Pick up the call!!

4
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,181
Move! Let's talk later!!!

5
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,771
There..

6
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,069
Who is it?

7
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,389
Who is there? Come out quickly!

8
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,359
I'm calling the police now!

9
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:39,339
Why are you here?

10
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:42,469
<i>I'm scared, someone's in the room.</i>

11
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,369
You stay out.

12
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,292
<i>Part 4 Remember Me In The Dark</i>

13
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,289
You called the police because of this cellphone?

14
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,309
Yes.

15
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,679
Who broke the front door?

16
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,703
Him.

17
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,399
So he got hurt while fighting with the culprit?

18
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,279
No, it's not because of that.

19
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,621
Then why did you call for us?

20
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:55,639
Because of the cellphone.

21
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,819
I've been constantly receiving text messages from that phone lately.

22
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,754
But that hand phone was in my room.

23
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,524
Ah, then the person who broke the front door,

24
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:08,264
and the person who hit this man, are both not the culprit, right?

25
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:11,031
Then why did you contact us?

26
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,991
Look here. Someone that I don't even know

27
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,101
came inside my house and left their phone when I wasn't here.

28
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,741
This was burglary.

29
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,671
Pursuant to Penal Code Section 319,

30
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:23,991
the consequences are up to 3 years in jail or up to a 500,000 won fine.

31
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:26,511
It's a given that we find the culprit and make him pay the consequences!

32
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:30,651
<i>She's totally crazy. This is going to be a pain.</i>

33
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:34,659
We will definitely track the owner of this phone and notify you immediately.

34
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,729
Are you leaving just like that?

35
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,359
What, you're not going to stakeout here?

36
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,727
A patrol car makes rounds in this neighborhood nightly, so rest assured.

37
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:49,886
What is this?

38
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,822
Are they just leaving?

39
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,722
Excuse me, Officer.

40
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:57,202
What happened? Was there a thief inside?

41
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,822
No, it's nothing special.

42
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,692
What now!?

43
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,062
Ahjussi, I have something to tell you.

44
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:11,192
But don't you need to go to the hospital first?

45
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:14,502
I know the person to whom the cell phone belongs.

46
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,182
What?

47
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,142
Ah, why is it like this?

48
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:21,578


49
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,772
Door, listen to me!

50
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,002
Do you think that's going to fix it?

51
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,902
You need to pull harder.

52
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,572
Why are you quibbling again?

53
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:46,292
You never know what might happen today, so don't stay by yourself.

54
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,162
That guy might come back.

55
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,862
I don't think now is the time to worry about me.

56
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:54,092
Tell me. Why are you here? And what's wrong with your face?

57
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,662
It's nothing big.

58
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,672
Regardless, stay with a friend for the time being.

59
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,895
Don't stay here.

60
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,461
What are you doing? Hey, hey!

61
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,206
Hey Gum. Come to your senses.

62
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,249
Where's my phone? Phone, phone..

63
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:17,016
I'm going crazy. 911

64
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,885
911

65
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:29,862
Hey. Are you sleeping?

66
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,005
Soo Ha

67
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:02,655
From now on, you're going to be living with your uncle.

68
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,695
That's fine, right?

69
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:11,815
You'll be sharing a room with your cousins.

70
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,415
<i>Brother-in-law, if you were going, you should have taken the boy with you.</i>

71
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:19,815
<i>Why did you go alone making it difficult for others?</i>

72
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,536
<i>It's already so difficult with 3, how am I going to raise another one.</i>

73
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,285
Uncle!

74
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:39,705
Uncle!

75
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,665
Over here!

76
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,715
Uncle!

77
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,805
<i>Please.. just disappear.</i>

78
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:52,115
<i>I can't immigrate with you along as well.</i>

79
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,235
Is he hurt badly?

80
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,812
Stay still for now. You've got a fever.

81
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:01,465
<i>Do I need to contact his parents?</i>

82
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,975
<i>They will be worrying.</i>

83
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,815
<i>But, why did he come to my house?</i>

84
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:08,785
<i>Why is he in this condition?</i>

85
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:12,234
<i>Gum.. is he a gangster?</i>

86
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,373
I don't have any parents to worry about me.

87
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,735
I came because I had something to ask you. Also, I fell on the way here, that's why I look like this.

88
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,415
And I'm not a gangster.

89
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:27,141
Gum, do you look into someone else's mind 24/7?

90
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,975
Since the bus stopped running, you can sleep here tonight.

91
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,845
In the morning, go straight to the hospital.

92
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,068
Hospital, my butt.

93
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:39,888
- Oh yeah, what did you want to ask me?
- What?

94
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,918
You said you came because you had something to ask me.

95
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,438
<i>Will she remember me?</i>

96
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,988
My name... do you know it?

97
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,608
Name?

98
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:54,208
I don't know.

99
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,798
We won't be seeing each other again, so there isn't any need to know.

100
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,840
It's Soo Ha.

101
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,688
Park Soo Ha.

102
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:13,827
Park.. Soo Ha?

103
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:22,045
Your name is surprisingly normal considering your temper.

104
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,745
Piece of gum is a perfect fit for you. It's perfect.

105
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,420
Sleep.

106
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:31,901
Idiot.

107
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,791
There's no way she would remember. It's from ten years ago.

108
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,795
Park Soo Ha?

109
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,841
I feel like I heard it before..

110
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,531
Hey, Gum! Turn off the lights before sleeping.

111
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,562
Why is there so much on the breakfast table?

112
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,493
Today's Do Yeon's birthday.

113
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,946
I made a reservation at a restaurant for 7pm,

114
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,121
so make sure to come.

115
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,528
Yesterday, I met Chief Kong.

116
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:47,701
He said you cancelled your prosecution. What happened?

117
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:53,883
Oh, that. I heard the witness changed her testimony.

118
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:57,307
Do Yeon was totally backstabbed too.

119
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:01,334
I heard the defendant's lawyer was Hye Seong.

120
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,212
Yes.

121
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:09,737
Hye Seong? The one that lived at our place ten years ago, that Hye Seong?

122
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:15,123
Yes. She has become a public defender.

123
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:20,998
After ten years, you meet the daughter of the housekeeper who became a public defender

124
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:24,758
and you cancelled your prosecution in front of her?

125
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,084
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,692
Next time, I won't make that kind of mistake.

127
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,547
You're not eating? Where are you going?

128
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:39,028
I forgot that I have to go to a crime scene this morning.

129
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:41,357
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:54,424
If you keep doing this, rumours will start to spread.

131
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,017
What kind of rumours?

132
00:11:56,017 --> 00:12:00,547
That you found Do Hyeon under a bridge.
(note: means she is not his legitimate daughter).

133
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,078
The joke is a bit much...

134
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,696
It's not a joke, you know that.

135
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:54,414
Well, even if I turn on my charm, it won't work on you.

136
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:58,510
So I don't have to look good in front of you, right?

137
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,602
It would seem that you don't have a Noona.

138
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:08,901
However, 99% of the women in the world look like this in the morning.

139
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,773
You should throw away useless fantasies and accept reality.

140
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,784
Do you want to drink?

141
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,258
No.

142
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:41,652
Okay!

143
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:45,262
Isn't this dog food?

144
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,679
Don't ask me for more after you eat it. Just eat.

145
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,066
How can you have only one spoon in this house?

146
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:54,430
I'm the only one living in this house. Would having one be normal or two?

147
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:07,091
Did you lose anything? It looks like the culprit made a mess trying to find something.

148
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,107
A mess?

149
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,934
The thief didn't do it.

150
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:20,031
If not the thief, then who...

151
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,812
You live like this?!!

152
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,545
<i> Who is your first love?</i>

153
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,101
<i> She's pretty, to die for. </i>

154
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,336
<i>She's not just pretty.</i>

155
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:41,615
<i> She's nice and smart. </i>

156
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,796
<i>She's the most wonderful woman in the world.</i>

157
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,701
99% of females in the world live like this.

158
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:53,654
In short, even Suzy and Girl's Generation live like this.

159
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:55,664
They probably all look like this at home too.

160
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:59,387
Eat or talk, just do one thing at a time!

161
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:02,691
He has left, my darling has left.

162
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,152
Toward the sun-lit green forest,

163
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,648
he is walking the short path away from me.

164
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:14,562
In this poem there are several interpretations of the "he" who has been lost.

165
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,993
I think "he" is someone's first love.

166
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:23,862
First love, you see, like this poem, makes people cry and is dazzlingly beautiful.

167
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,275
The hope that you'll meet your first love again makes your heart race.

168
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:31,462
Do you guys have that kind of first love?

169
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,006
No!

170
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,895
Damn.

171
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:45,608
How did you bring all of this? What about the store?

172
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,438
I left it in the care of Mr. Kim who works at the pizza place.

173
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:54,209
Yah, since you did that well on your first case, how much will they demand that you treat them.

174
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,339
If it fell on you only, because it would be left to me,

175
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,987
so I'm trying to help a little.

176
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,155
Oh, look.

177
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:04,582
This is seasoned and the other is fried.

178
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,583
You should hire people. Did you come all the way here since dawn just to give me this?

179
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,286
Would that be it?

180
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,315
Here.

181
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:18,940
Kirin Hotel at 7pm?

182
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:19,999
What's this?

183
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:22,196
He is my friend's son.

184
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:27,609
He is around your age and he also seems to be a good guy.

185
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:31,582
He's also a lawyer, so you two will get along.

186
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,077
Are you telling me to go on a blind date?

187
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,252
He's the son of a sauna house owner. He's super rich.

188
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:38,916
That all comes second though.

189
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:42,481
Mom, I have no intention of getting married.

190
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:47,442
Why? You wanted to get married early!

191
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:51,890
That was a month ago, but looking at the result of this case,

192
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,741


193
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:57,962
I'm the blue chip in my field.

194
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:02,497
Blue chip? You're spewing nonsense here.

195
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:05,428
If you'd seen me at the trial, you won't be calling me an ass.

196
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,405
I'm on a different level than other lawyers.

197
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:10,412
I was surprised at myself too.

198
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:14,634
To give up this talent for marriage is a huge disservice to the law.

199
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:18,699
So for now, just think that I'm married to the law.

200
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,912
Hey.

201
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,649
Your over-exaggeration is always the problem.

202
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:25,234
You've only won one trial.

203
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,878
Mom, be careful of my head!

204
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:28,667
With anything, if you want to do it for a long time,

205
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:32,177
you need to be humble, you understand?

206
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,058
I understand. I'll put this right back.

207
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,525
Oh! You aren't trying to stop me?

208
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:48,276
Whenever I look at your eyes, they are shining.

209
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,361
Working is better than marriage.

210
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:54,807
When water comes in, we should row the oars, shouldn't we?

211
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:59,239
Wait a little bit and eat lunch with me.

212
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,159
No, it's fine. I need to be getting back.

213
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:05,280
I told you to hire more people.

214
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,824
OK, I got it. Just go back in.

215
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,243
After she does her second trial, we'll die buried in chicken, it seems.

216
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,990
Lawyer Jang. Eat some chicken.

217
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,377
That's fine. Please eat to your fill.

218
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,862
Isn't this too fancy?

219
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:28,887
This is really expensive to do. If you do this at a shop, they'll probably charge you 20,000 won.

220
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,833
You have great talent. Anyways, consider yourself lucky.

221
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:39,148
There are many lawyers who just say a few lines and get a lot of money for it.

222
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:44,622
But look at me. I go to the school to investigate, I convince the witness. On top of that, I do all of it for free.

223
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,442
You should be grateful you met a lawyer like this.

224
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:50,810
I know it. I will tell myself that for the rest of my life.

225
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,412
OK. Write it here, and have it notarized before leaving.

226
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,052
At first, when I saw you, I thought I stepped on c***.

227
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,279
But then I changed my mind.

228
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,699
You trusted me when no one, my family, my teachers, trusted me.

229
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:10,960
Why did you trust me?

230
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,375
Yeah, uh, that is...

231
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:19,793
Well...I just got a feeling. You gave off the right feeling.

232
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:24,179
Thanks. Eonnie is the only person who-

233
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,672
Wait. Soo Ha also trusted me.

234
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,679
But why didn't Gum come with you?

235
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,235
He was going to come too. But he got a call and went somewhere else.

236
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,982
Where?

237
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,136
Who was the owner of the phone?

238
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:41,356
It was just a random ahjumma's phone. Are you happy?

239
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:44,076
But why is that in someone else's house? Did you check the fingerprints?

240
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:46,578
Nothing's coming up!

241
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:50,091
What about the person I asked about? Did you talk to Min Joon Gook?

242
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,534
He was living as a reliable, good man! He always volunteers.

243
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,645
Did you meet him? Where was he?

244
00:19:55,692 --> 00:20:00,698
Aish, I can't tell you that. It's in our rulebook.

245
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,378
It's because he's a dangerous man.

246
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,671
<i>It seems to me that you're the dangerous one, kid.</i>

247
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,923
OK, OK. We'll keep monitoring him, so

248
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,624
put your attention on studying.

249
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,292
Is he living in the city of Yeon Joo?

250
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,361
Perhaps, is he living near the Justice Building?

251
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:17,138
<i>Woah! He's like a ghost.</i>

252
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,131
<i>Did he just guess at random?</i>

253
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,939
No! He's living somewhere far away.

254
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,319
Even if you keep asking, I won't answer.So, stop asking, punk!

255
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,350
Aigoo, regardless, you drank a lot of alcohol.

256
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,499
You can take that one. Yes, that one.

257
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:51,692
Have a nice meal.

258
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:58,971
I'm sorry. I'm just holding it for a while.

259
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:05,220
It's steamed sweet potatoes. So, if you put it in your pocket, it'll become mush.

260
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,562
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.

261
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:12,849
<i>He's still breathing! I should have just killed in one shot.</i>

262
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:26,174
<i>Dad!!</i>

263
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:32,141
<i>I told you I'd kill you! I will also kill all the people who listened to you!</i>

264
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,792
Have a nice meal.

265
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:57,628
You look like a student. Did you come because you were hungry?

266
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:03,133
No, I was interested in volunteering. How can I start?

267
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,309
Really?

268
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:06,708
- Manager Kim.
- Yes!

269
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,640
There's

270
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,993
a brother that wants to volunteer here. What's your name?

271
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:17,195
It's Kim...Joong Ki.

272
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,210
Lawyer Jang,

273
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,262
your new case.

274
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:33,927
What kind of case has so many files?

275
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:39,284
<i>Seo Do Yeon</i>

276
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,690
It's Seo Do Yeon.

277
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,518
I heard you went to school together.

278
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:43,564
Yes.

279
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:47,363
Since high school, her effectiveness has dropped quite a lot.

280
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:51,230
I wonder if it's her style to use a whole bag of flour to make biscuits?

281
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:55,405
Seeing the records for the lawsuit, she sure did overdo it quite a lot again.

282
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:59,286
She doesn't seem to be overdoing it.

283
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:03,412
The point of contention is very peculiar.

284
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:07,598
Two brothers came into a convenience store and stole all the money.

285
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:10,469
<i>What are you? What are you doing?!</i>

286
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,269
They got caught by the owner. So, one of them stabbed the owner with a knife.

287
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:14,269
<i>Let go!</i>

288
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,922
The other tried to stop him.

289
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,442
It seems like a normal case.

290
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,107
The stabbing one should be charged for murder, and the other one should be charged for robbery.

291
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:24,711
Won't it be solved cleanly?

292
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:30,380
But, the prosecutor is charging both for murder.

293
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:33,303
Is Do Yeon in the right state of mind?

294
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:36,770
One of them definitely tried to stop his brother. It doesn't make sense to charge both.

295
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,526
Do Yeon is like that. Always overdoing things.

296
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:43,100
It seems like that...but she doesn't have a choice.

297
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:46,641
Who stabbed and who tried to stop it,

298
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,863
it's hard to tell.

299
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,636
Why can't you tell?

300
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:53,713
There should have been a CCTV installed, right?

301
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:58,433
Those two brothers are twins. Added to that, they are identical.

302
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:04,149
As well, both of them have confessed that he himself did the stabbing.

303
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:07,726
Well, how similar are they?

304
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,889
What in the world...

305
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,796
Am I defending the one that stabbed or the one that tried to stop it?

306
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:20,444
In the arraignment, it was recorded as the one who stabbed.

307
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:31,030
You're Jeong Pil Seung, right? Not Jeong Pil Ja.

308
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,815
Yes,

309
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:34,614
I'm Jeong Pil Seung. I'm the younger one.

310
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:38,784
I'm the lawyer in charge of your case.

311
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:39,983
Yes, I know.

312
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:42,065
You're Lawyer Jang Hye Seong, right?

313
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,966
I've heard a lot about you.

314
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:45,562
About me?

315
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:49,685
That you, from the very first case as a new appointee, crushed the prosecutor to a pulp.

316
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,551
The rumour has spread quite far.

317
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:55,301
They said I was lucky and everybody was jealous of me.

318
00:24:55,301 --> 00:25:01,272
We'll have to get to the end of this trial to see if you're lucky or not.

319
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:03,269
You and your brother have both been

320
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,449
charged for robbery and murder.

321
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,224
Right?

322
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,456
It's not Hyung!

323
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:10,679
Hyung just followed me and is trying to take the blame.

324
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,513
I stabbed him.

325
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,560
You don't have any previous criminal record.

326
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,862
Yes,

327
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,749
but my brother does.

328
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,663
If he is charged for murder and since it's a repeat offense,

329
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:22,892
he might get a life sentence.

330
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:28,626
So you're going to take the blame, instead of him, because you don't have a prior record.

331
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,662
No, it's not like that.

332
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,932
I really stabbed him! Hyung is innocent.

333
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,547
Please argue like that.

334
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,989
Look, I'm your lawyer.

335
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:42,706
And, what's the mileage of a police record?

336
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:45,807
When you accumulate that, do you even know what you will get?

337
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,174
Get yourself together, Pil Seung!

338
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:51,757
This is a matter of rotting in jail for the rest of your life.

339
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:53,439
I know.

340
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:59,632
That is why I am begging you, Lawyer.

341
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:32,433
I took in a puppy a while ago.

342
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:36,507
I didn't know this would happen, and the puppy just started to walk.

343
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,654
Could you walk him for me?

344
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:48,484
<i>Grand Prize Jeong Pil Seung</i>

345
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:18,595
Sleep or type. Do one of them.

346
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,501
I can't.

347
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,853
Since the closing argument for Jo Yeong Sook's case is tomorrow,

348
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:23,550
I have to finish it today.

349
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,632
I'll do it.

350
00:27:25,632 --> 00:27:28,302
You were up all night again yesterday, right?

351
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:30,277
This brain ought to be replaced by inserting a block of wood.

352
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,979
it's not working right now.

353
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:34,315
You're here?

354
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,325
You arrived?

355
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,689
What is that?

356
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:42,381
Ahhish, it's a puppy.

357
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,362
It is Mr. Pil Seung's puppy.

358
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:46,939
I said I'll take care of it until the case ends.

359
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:48,564
Until the case ends?

360
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:52,396
He's charged for robbery and murder, so he'll get like 10 years.

361
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:54,909
He didn't murder anyone.

362
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,192
The prosecution is wrong.

363
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,024
Again, the prosecution is wrong?

364
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,362
Yes.

365
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:02,200
I did it last time. Why would I not this time?

366
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:07,429
By the way, that case seemed to have been consolidated with his hyung's case.

367
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:09,017
Huh?

368
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:12,766
So the two brothers will be tried together?

369
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,612
Yes.

370
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:17,932
Perhaps this time you'll have to prepare to fight the other brother's lawyer more than the prosecutor.

371
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:21,564
He'll probably say his client is not the murderer too.

372
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:24,811
Who's the elder brother's lawyer?

373
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,764
He's a public defender too.

374
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:28,465
Public defender?

375
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,426
Is it Lawyer Shin?

376
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:31,862
No.

377
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:34,860
There. It is Lawyer Cha.

378
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:40,124
Lawyer Cha?

379
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:57,362
It's hard work, right? This much won't even last a week.

380
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,070
When did you start volunteering here?

381
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,981
It's almost been a month.

382
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:05,057
So you've lived in this church for a month?

383
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,356
Yes.

384
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,110
Why are you looking like that?

385
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:16,462
Do you, by chance, remember me? You look familiar.

386
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,647
No.

387
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,058
<i>Where have I seen him?</i>

388
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:26,762
<i>I seem to have some impression.</i>

389
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:32,728
You went to the courthouse a few days ago, right? Yeon Joo courthouse.

390
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:38,462
<i>Did he see me there?</i>

391
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,562
Right.

392
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:45,942
No.

393
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:48,035
I never went to court.

394
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,834
I think I've mistaken you for someone else.

395
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:08,925
Can I get a Green Grape Sparkling?

396
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,150
Yes.

397
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:14,650
I would like a grande iced tea, please.

398
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:16,762
Please charge hers on this card too.

399
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:18,562
Yes.

400
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:24,985
Get rid of any prejudice that old people drink only tea house coffee.

401
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:27,800
It's not that...What's up?

402
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,679
You never buy drinks for me.

403
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,691
So, you don't want it?

404
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:36,604
There's no need for that.

405
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:39,162
Do you have time for dinner today?

406
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:42,105
Our office is going to have dinner together.

407
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:43,762
I can go too?

408
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,718
You leave me out of dinners all the time.

409
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:48,487
Yeah...so you can't come?

410
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:50,091
No, well...

411
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:53,031
I'll check to see if I have time.

412
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:55,536
I'll go if I can.

413
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:58,799
Why are you here at court?

414
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,679
You don't have a trial today.

415
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,605
Lawyer Cha has a trial today.

416
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,857
I came to see if he's doing well.

417
00:31:04,857 --> 00:31:08,116
Does it matter if the lawyer does well or not?

418
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,266
The defendant admitted to the crime.

419
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,671
Well, it's a simple case, isn't it?

420
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:16,146
Don't you want to know how he's going to argue about the sentence?

421
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:23,952
The defendant, Jo Yeong Sook, on March 16, 2012 at the Poong Jak Village Hat Salon,

422
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,323
stole 6,000,000 won in donations for the disabled, and

423
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:29,032
was arrested due to the Hat Salon director's police report.

424
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,737
When being arrested, the defendant waved a knife at the police.

425
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:36,872
Even if we consider that the defendant is speech-impaired,

426
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,595
the crime was planned ahead.

427
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:41,477
She didn't reflect upon lying in court.

428
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:44,372
Considering that the victim is requesting severe punishment,

429
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,242
applying Penal Code Section 331 Paragraph 2 Special Larceny

430
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,797
and Penal Code Article 136 Paragraph 1 and Section 144 Paragraph 2

431
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:51,869
Special Obstruction of a Government Officer Performing His Duty,

432
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,936
we are requesting two years of imprisonment.

433
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,258
Next.

434
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:03,543
The public defender can go now.

435
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:05,566
Yes.

436
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:19,429


437
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:35,426
It's not that folder. Go into the USB folder.

438
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,011
Yes. USB...

439
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,543
Did he bring the wrong information?

440
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,313
Why isn't this working?

441
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:49,817
Lawyer.

442
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:53,167
It's in the USB folder.

443
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,110
Yes. USB.

444
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:57,460
What?

445
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,501
Why is he doing that?

446
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,011
Why is this not working?

447
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,296
It's in the USB folder!

448
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:17,453
Yes.

449
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,576
Uh, this is...

450
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:23,378
Lawyer!

451
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:26,142
I said inside it. Did you not hear me?

452
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,384
I heard it well, Your Honor.

453
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:38,485
Your Honor,

454
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,188
you just experienced what it's like to be the defendant.

455
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,267
Like the defendant, no matter what you say,

456
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,300
other people don't hear you.

457
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,008
You got angry and banged the desk within 50 seconds.

458
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:58,708
If other people can't hear what I say,

459
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,238
I'll say it again louder.

460
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:05,512
But if they still can't hear,

461
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:08,977
then I'll speak even louder.

462
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:13,055
But if they still can't hear, then I get mad,

463
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,971
like the judge just did...

464
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,768
in 50 seconds.

465
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:18,835
But,

466
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,601
what if it wasn't for just 50 seconds,

467
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,327
but if they couldn't hear you for 50 years,

468
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:26,290
what would you have done?

469
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:29,862
You would have gotten angry a lot.

470
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:32,333
Instead of yelling and getting mad, the defendant

471
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,933
made donations.

472
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:40,621
She devoted herself to handicapped people like her.

473
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,399
She donated more than 30 million won.

474
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,332
When she couldn't repay her debts,

475
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:53,434
and went to the Hat Salon Director to ask for some money, she was turned away at the door and treated coldly.

476
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:58,195
Even though she was patient numerous times and begged, she wasn't listened to.

477
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:05,016
Of course, stealing money, out of anger, is definitely a crime.

478
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:09,815
She should have held it in, just like she has for 50 years.

479
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:11,760
But,

480
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:15,801
in that long time, was it so hard for even one person around the defendant

481
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:19,319
to listen to her voice?

482
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:23,791
Had they listened to the defendant's cries even once,

483
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,743
how might all this have turned out?

484
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,425
The person that has made the defendant come to stand here today,

485
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,269
may not be the defendant herself,

486
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,239
but we,

487
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,456
who are deaf.

488
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:46,544
<i>In that long time, was it so hard for even one person around the defendant</i>

489
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:50,032
<i>to listen to her voice?</i>

490
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:54,674
<i>Had they listened to the defendant's cries even once,</i>

491
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,515
<i>how might have all this turned out?</i>

492
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:59,145
<i>The person that has made the defendant come to stand here today,</i>

493
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:01,033
<i>may not be the defendant herself,</i>

494
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,954
<i>but we,</i>

495
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,312
<i>who are deaf.</i>

496
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,198
What are you doing here?

497
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:13,840
What about you?

498
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:19,688
Because that lawyer is going to take part in the twin case.

499
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,606
What is this?

500
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,700
You're out on a reconnaissance?

501
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:28,633
Yep.

502
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:32,613
This case makes me worry in various ways.

503
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:35,662
Of course it would,

504
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,559
there's going to be an evaluation soon.

505
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:40,148
With a public defender as counterpart, you withdrew the case.

506
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,254
If you can't handle this case well,

507
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,333
you'll have a lot to worry about.

508
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:46,377
I know, right?

509
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:49,082
The opposing lawyer is hard to deal with too.

510
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,201
Are you complimenting me?

511
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:54,885
No, not you.

512
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:57,739
Lawyer Cha.

513
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:02,102
You're probably worried too, after you saw that trial.

514
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:04,534
Isn't that right?

515
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,225
Not really.

516
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,003
- Joon Gook.
- Yes?

517
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:25,319
Do you know the high school volunteer's number?

518
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,235
I don't know his number, but I do know his name and school.

519
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:29,176
Is that so?

520
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:32,208
I forgot to give this to him while he was volunteering.

521
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:33,877
<i>Proof of Volunteer Work</i>

522
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:36,022
Is this important?

523
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:39,416
These days they need it to get into college.

524
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,406
Ah, what to do?

525
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,206
I'll go drop it off.

526
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,801
Ah, Kim Joong-

527
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:05,021
Student!

528
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,380
Can you call that student for me?

529
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:09,194
The one that's tall and playing catch.

530
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:11,684
Who? Park Soo Ha?

531
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,484
Park Soo Ha?

532
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,739
His name is Park Soo Ha? Not Kim Joong Ki.

533
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,892
No, it's not.

534
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,943
I'm Kim Joong Ki.

535
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,271
He's going around using my name?

536
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,177
Ah, no...

537
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,972
His name is Park Soo Ha?

538
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:37,626
<i> Do you remember me? </i>

539
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:39,708
<i>Because you seem familiar.</i>

540
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,431
Student.

541
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:53,192
Do you happen to know Park Soo Ha's phone number?

542
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,909
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

543
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,615
Lawyer Jang, why don't you have a glass of wine too?

544
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:08,093
Today, it's all on Lawyer Shin.

545
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,257
I don't drink alcohol.

546
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:13,253
Then, should we order individually?

547
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,045
Why are you staring so intently?

548
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:19,038
Is something on my face?

549
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:20,985
No,

550
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,049
you're inviting me to dinner parties,

551
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,742
and you're letting me drop honorific terms.

552
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,301
It's weird.

553
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,786
You weren't like this before.

554
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:28,921
Usually,

555
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:31,194
I'm a bit harsh on people without talent.

556
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:35,112
Eh, so you're saying Lawyer Jang didn't have talent?

557
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:36,768
Of course she didn't.

558
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:38,614
But with Lawyer Cha, you dropped honorifics right away.

559
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:41,057
He's a talented guy.

560
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:43,901
You saw his trial just a while ago too.

561
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:45,691
Eh, Lawyer Shin.

562
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:48,516
Did you call me to the dinner for this?

563
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:49,832
To compare in each other's presence?

564
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:52,012
Why? Why don't you continue to use honorifics with me?

565
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,497
Why did you drop honorifics when I am this utterly without talent.

566
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:55,820
Don't worry,

567
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,658
you have your strengths too.

568
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,107
It's alright,

569
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,343
it's not even as if you're slapping my cheek, then humoring me.

570
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,752
What's my strength?

571
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,009
Your eyes.

572
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:12,669
My eyes?

573
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:15,015
Eyes that can tell

574
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:18,912
whether the defendant is lying or telling the truth.

575
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,402
No, but...

576
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:27,049
Other than that, what other strengths do I have?

577
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:29,433
Uh, other than that...

578
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:33,508
there aren't any other.

579
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:34,811
That doesn't make sense.

580
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,483
I even went to the defendant's school for that case.

581
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,199
That's because Lawyer Cha took you there.

582
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,212
Even in court when the prosecutor made a rebuttal, I made a game saving tackle . . .

583
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:44,948
You barely escaped only because I helped you.

584
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:45,819
Also!

585
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,230
What else is there?

586
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,742
Also!

587
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,144
Excuse me, can you please get me a glass of wine?

588
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:54,380
I thought you said you don't drink!

589
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,239
I said I won't, not that I can't!

590
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:12,101
Why do I only have one strength?

591
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,502
I asked why do I only have one strength?

592
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:21,658
You should have said she had 10 or something. What is this now?

593
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:24,674
Who knew she would whine this much?

594
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:26,621
Let's go.

595
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,605
Then, what about Lawyer Jang?

596
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:31,213
Lawyer Cha can take care of that.

597
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:33,639
Or you can.

598
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,840
Yes?

599
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,068
I'm sorry. Today's an ancestor's memorial, so I have to get going...

600
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:41,021
I have to be there as the first son, so I'll be leaving first.

601
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:55,431
Those eyes aren't mine.

602
00:41:56,801 --> 00:42:01,141
I don't have eyes that can see through the defendant.

603
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:05,190
I don't see. I can't see.

604
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,261
Where did everyone go?

605
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,971
Lawyer Jang, where did everyone go?

606
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:26,076
I don't know. They must have all left without telling me.

607
00:42:30,388 --> 00:42:33,482
Wow, her drunkenness is out there.

608
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:36,422
I don't see the truth.

609
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:48,017
Oh no!

610
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:51,282
Now, I really can't see.

611
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:55,223
What do I do? What should I do now?

612
00:42:56,355 --> 00:42:57,563
Here.

613
00:42:58,283 --> 00:42:59,528
Here.

614
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:02,200
Can you see now?

615
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:06,990
What should I do?

616
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,330
My eyes must be crazy.

617
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,144
Lawyer Cha has suddenly become a flower boy.

618
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:17,599
Oh my eyes have gone bad.

619
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,377
A flower boy.

620
00:43:26,558 --> 00:43:31,077
That's right. I'm not a good judge of people.

621
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,789
So I need that piece of gum with me at all times.

622
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:39,429
Lawyer Jang, we'll look for that piece of gum another time. Let's find your home first instead.

623
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:41,453
Where is your house?

624
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,079
If he's not around, I can't go into a courtroom.

625
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,706
Why? Because my eyes have gone bad.

626
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,196
I can't see again.

627
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:00,996
Here.

628
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:02,676
There you go.

629
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:06,906
Excuse me, but where is your home?

630
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:10,426
Geez, I'm going crazy.

631
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,107
Why isn't she coming out?

632
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,755
Why isn't she answering her phone?

633
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,608
What is this?

634
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:41,056
What's the matter? Are you sick?

635
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:44,206
What a stench.

636
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,906
Hey, you were the one who came into our office, right?

637
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:47,910
Yes.

638
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,419
But what are you doing here?

639
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,259
I had something to say to Lawyer Jang.

640
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:56,889
As you can clearly see, she not in a state to listen to you.

641
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,689
<i>Where does she live exactly?</i>

642
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,739
<i>I can't take her to my house either.</i>

643
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,949
<i>Should I take her back to the office?</i>

644
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:06,009
<i>It will be cold there at night.</i>

645
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,919
I'll escort you to Lawyer Jang's house.

646
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:10,889
You know where she lives?

647
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:12,839
Yes, I've been there a few times.

648
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,656
Hand her to me and catch us a taxi.

649
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:26,696
Excuse me, but I'll take her by myself.

650
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:30,456
You can take her by yourself? She's heavier than she appears.

651
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:32,796
But for us to both take her home is a little excessive.

652
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,509
Is that so?

653
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,777
--Please take them safely.
--Yes.

654
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:43,079
<i>Can I trust this rascal?</i>

655
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,529
May I have one of your business cards, so that I can contact you after I get her home.

656
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,083
Sure.

657
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:53,529
If it's too difficult by yourself, contact me. I'll come right away.

658
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:56,412
That's alright. I'll be fine by myself.

659
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,189
Exactly how much

660
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:10,007
did you eat at the party,

661
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:12,891
that you're so heavy?

662
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,505
Damn.

663
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:21,412
It's still not fixed.

664
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:25,132
After what happened, you should be cautious.

665
00:46:34,165 --> 00:46:44,284


666
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,142
♪<i> What made you finally appear?</i>

667
00:46:56,142 --> 00:47:01,752
♪<i> Where were you? </i>

668
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:09,488
♪<i>Even though it's a little late, still we've finally met.</i>

669
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:11,492
This place is disgusting.

670
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,639
Gum.

671
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:27,978
Bring him here.

672
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,559
I need him at court.

673
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,689
What is she saying?

674
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:37,598
I need Gum...

675
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:42,836
He needs to be with me...

676
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:48,325
My eyes are rotten.

677
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,834
- Hello
<i>- Hey, you little brat!</i>

678
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,774
Pick up the phone properly!

679
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,064
<i>Do you want to see blood and death?</i>

680
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:35,584
<i>Sober up, you wench!</i>

681
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:38,584
Do you have to die in your mother's hands to get some sense?

682
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:45,290
Mom, talk softly. My ear is going to explode.

683
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,294
But what's wrong with your voice?

684
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:52,264
Are you hurt anywhere?

685
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:56,440
Yesterday, I had a dinner,

686
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,414
and drank some alcohol. I must have lost it.

687
00:48:58,414 --> 00:49:00,634
But don't you hate alcohol?

688
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:03,474
Why did you drink it then?

689
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,494
Is there something wrong?

690
00:49:06,931 --> 00:49:12,859
Mom, should I go meet that bathhouse son from last time?

691
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:16,459
Didn't you say you are forever married to the law?

692
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:18,499
The law and I had a falling out.

693
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:20,709
Why?

694
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:24,199
I don't know. I guess the law didn't want to be married to me.

695
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:31,041
How pathetic. You change your mind so easily.

696
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,629
I know, right. Why am I like this?

697
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:48,459
Hye Seong, do you even know how to do anything?

698
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,319
You're coming now?

699
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:55,609
Did you get home safely yesterday?

700
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:57,719
Do your insides feel alright?

701
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:58,919
Yes.

702
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:00,959
How do I look?

703
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:04,239
Do I still seem like a flower boy?

704
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,430
Wake up!

705
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,059
You seem to still be drunk!

706
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,859
I must have been crazy.

707
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,569
My eyes are really crazy.

708
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:29,449
I'm sober now,

709
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:32,674
but he still looks good even with those glasses.

710
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:46,962
Good morning.

711
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:48,562
Good morning.

712
00:50:58,262 --> 00:50:59,562
Why are you looking at me that way?

713
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:02,362
Is something on my face?

714
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:06,562
Yesterday, did anything happen with Lawyer Jang?

715
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:08,262
Nothing really.

716
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:11,849
Ah! The high school student we saw before. Did he say he was Park Soo Ha?

717
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:13,862
That pal had come to get her.

718
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:19,162
That kid seems to escort her here and back everyday. Maybe he's a bodyguard?

719
00:51:20,862 --> 00:51:22,062
Hey, Lawyer Cha.

720
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:28,062
Have you asked Lawyer Jang whether she knows that person named Min Joon Gook or whatever?

721
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,095
How do you, Lawyer Shin, know Min Joon Gook?

722
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,662
I was told he was a cell mate of someone I know.

723
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:45,362
Is he someone you know?

724
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:47,862
Yes.

725
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:50,662
That person, he was released a little while ago.

726
00:51:50,662 --> 00:51:53,962
I was told he had inquired after you.

727
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:56,562
Released?

728
00:51:59,162 --> 00:52:01,762
When did he get released?

729
00:52:01,762 --> 00:52:04,862
It must have been about a month ago.

730
00:52:04,862 --> 00:52:08,362
He had some debt to repay to you?

731
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:21,062
<i>I'll be there</i>

732
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:28,133
Could it be that person sent this too?

733
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:45,862
Sorry.

734
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:17,062
What are you doing here?

735
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,462
You didn't accept my calls, so I just came here.

736
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:23,062
The incident happened so long ago, and you still haven't fixed your lock?

737
00:53:23,062 --> 00:53:24,515
Go.

738
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:26,162
I'll take care of it.

739
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:29,062
It's alright. I'm doing this in thanks for saving Seong Bin.

740
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:31,762
I told you go!

741
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,260
What's up? Is something wrong?

742
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,758
Get lost! Go!

743
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:41,062
Don't come here again!

744
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:47,262
<i>I don't know if this rascal is with Min Joon Gook or not.</i>

745
00:54:03,562 --> 00:54:04,762
Hello?

746
00:54:04,772 --> 00:54:06,431
It's me.

747
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:08,662
You remember my voice, right?

748
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:12,862
Ah, yes. You're Min Joon Gook, right?

749
00:54:12,862 --> 00:54:14,562
How did you know my number?

750
00:54:14,562 --> 00:54:17,862
I went to your school yesterday,

751
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:20,762
Park Soo Ha.

752
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,565
You didn't tell me your name, so I didn't recognize you.

753
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:26,962
I last saw you at court, ten years ago?

754
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:30,603
You... Where are you right now?

755
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:53,662
I didn't know what you liked, so I got this.

756
00:54:53,662 --> 00:54:55,062
Eat.

757
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:59,262
<i>You came, little one.</i>

758
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,562
What are you thinking up?

759
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:05,862
<i>You grew a lot, little one.</i>

760
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:11,562
<i>Your ability to read my thoughts that you had 10 years ago doesn't seemed to have changed</i>

761
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:15,362
Speak up, and don't think them.

762
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:17,145
<i>What are you worried about?</i>

763
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:20,962
<i>Why, you think I'm going to cause some trouble?</i>

764
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:27,262
The cellphone is your doing, isn't it? You sent it.

765
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:36,962
<i>Are you getting scared from just that? When I haven't even started...</i>

766
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,437
What are you thinking.

767
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,387
<i>Don't worry. </i>

768
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:44,662
<i>I don't have any hard feelings towards you.</i>

769
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:49,137
<i>10 years ago the target wasn't you, but your father.</i>

770
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:53,754
<i>This time too... it isn't you, but someone else.</i>

771
00:55:57,162 --> 00:56:01,362
If it's not me, who is it?

772
00:56:01,362 --> 00:56:07,162
<i>She became a lawyer, I've heard. That girl.</i>

773
00:56:14,262 --> 00:56:16,562
Let go of me!

774
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,723
Ahh! Save me!

775
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:01,662
Hello?

776
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,562
At the police station?

777
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:10,762
Ms. Jang Hye Seong! Hello.

778
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:11,862
What happened?

779
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:17,362
You know Park Soo Ha, the kid who was with you at the cell phone incident, right?

780
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,846
Yes.

781
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:22,062
Right now, that student beat up someone and is here.

782
00:57:22,062 --> 00:57:26,462
A guardian has to sign him out, but he doesn't have parents and we can't contact his teacher.

783
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:30,062
So for now, I've called Lawyer Jang over.

784
00:57:30,062 --> 00:57:31,432
What about the victim?

785
00:57:31,432 --> 00:57:34,562
He left saying he doesn't want to charge for anything.

786
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:39,262
He just got released, so I guess he doesn't want to get involved in anything.

787
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:41,481
Released?

788
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:45,935
Yes. But the CCTV caught Park Soo Ha beating him up.

789
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:50,162
I can't give him bail unless someone can be liable for him.

790
00:57:52,062 --> 00:57:53,762
What was the victim's name?

791
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:59,683
Yes, it's Min Joon Gook. He got released last month.

792
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:01,387
What?

793
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,562
Do you know this person?

794
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:10,162
May I see the CCTV?

795
00:58:10,162 --> 00:58:12,962
Let's see...

796
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:14,964
Did Soo Ha say why he hit him?

797
00:58:14,964 --> 00:58:20,262
I don't know. From what witnesses say, it was just a fit of rage.

798
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:22,862
There has to be a reason though.

799
00:58:22,928 --> 00:58:24,463
Yeah, but there isn't any!

800
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,144
Min Joon Gook didn't say a word,

801
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:30,268
but then Park Soo Ha punched him!

802
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:34,362
I was there too. Min Joon Gook really didn't say anything.

803
00:58:34,362 --> 00:58:37,762
Soo Ha was the only one talking.

804
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:41,862
Ah! Here it is! I found it!

805
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:43,062
This here.

806
00:58:49,562 --> 00:58:51,263
What is Soo Ha saying?

807
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,662
What did he say?

808
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:58,012
Ah. He kept telling Min Joon Gook to speak up.

809
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:01,462
Not to think, but speak.

810
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:05,387
Say it, bastard!

811
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:08,689
Say what you're thinking!

812
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,062
<i>I don't want to.</i>

813
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:13,262
What are you doing? Let go and talk it out.

814
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,357
If that person wasn't there I would've died 10 years ago.

815
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:23,862
That's why think of my life as hers!

816
00:59:23,862 --> 00:59:26,062
I'm going to protect her.

817
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:32,678
Get lost! I'm letting my life hang on the line to protect her.

818
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:35,562
Don't you dare do anything, because I'll kill you.

819
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:40,462
I'll kill you with my own hands.

820
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:44,662
If he bothers that woman, he announced he'd kill him.

821
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,641
I thought I was going to poop in my pants trying to hold him off.

822
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:48,662
He's totally crazy.

823
00:59:50,262 --> 00:59:52,906
This punk, he even brought a hammer with him!

824
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:56,762
If he'd used this, this would've been a much bigger situation.

825
01:00:01,762 --> 01:00:02,962
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

826
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:06,346
<i>If she wasn't there 10 years ago, I would've been killed by you.</i>

827
01:00:11,662 --> 01:00:15,662
<i>I... I...</i>

828
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:19,845
<i>will... protect you...</i>

829
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:24,862
<i>I wouldn't have lived if it weren't for her, so I'm going to protect her even if it kills me.</i>

830
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,962
<i>I'll risk my life to protect her.</i>

831
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,963
<i>I... </i>

832
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:38,862
<i>will... protect you...</i>

833
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,062
<i>What is this...</i>

834
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:44,554
<i>You know how to talk.</i>

835
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:50,727
<i>Kid.</i>

836
01:00:50,762 --> 01:00:52,862
<i>What is your name?</i>

837
01:00:53,962 --> 01:00:56,095
<i>Soo Ha...</i>

838
01:00:57,162 --> 01:01:00,062
<i>Park Soo Ha.</i>

839
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,431
I will be liable for him.

840
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:16,362
Where's Soo Ha?

841
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:17,362
<i>Police</i>

842
01:01:19,451 --> 01:01:22,055
You let Min Joon Gook go!

843
01:01:22,062 --> 01:01:24,362
Did you get his address? What about his phone number?

844
01:01:24,362 --> 01:01:27,862
Hey, you seem to be misunderstanding something.

845
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:30,556
You were the one hitting. Min Joon Gook was the one getting hit.

846
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:34,862
You're the culprit. He's the victim. You got that?

847
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:38,462
Do know what he said? He's going to take revenge.

848
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:41,762
He's going to find the one who testified against him and kill her.

849
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:44,262
I believed you and asked all the witnesses at the restaurant.

850
01:01:44,262 --> 01:01:46,162
There were no such words.

851
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:49,662
Min Joon Gook volunteers at

852
01:01:49,662 --> 01:01:53,162
more than 6 places, such as soup kitchens and animal shelters.

853
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:57,937
He changed for the better. Yet you're accusing him without any evidence.

854
01:01:58,562 --> 01:02:02,262
You should, at least, bring some evidence.

855
01:02:08,198 --> 01:02:09,523
There's evidence.

856
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:12,024
What? What evidence?

857
01:02:13,962 --> 01:02:16,162
I heard it. I can hear minds...

858
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:18,162
Stop it.

859
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,662
<i>Don't say anything that's useless.</i>

860
01:02:24,862 --> 01:02:30,562
<i>You'll just get treated like you did 10 years ago in court.</i>

861
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:34,262
<i>Park Soo Ha.</i>

862
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:38,862
<i>I remember your name now.</i>

863
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:55,162
