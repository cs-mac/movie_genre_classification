1
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,979
Did you save your patient, Daddy?

2
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,239
Of course.

3
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,677
You know I'm the best.

4
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,818
Sure. And me?

5
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,920
You're the best at being naughty.

6
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,120
Something else.

7
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,316
Something else? Hold on...

8
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,722
You're the best little girl in the worId.

9
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,256
Hold my hand.

10
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,600
I'll deliver my invitations after Iunch.

11
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,296
Your party's in 2 weeks.

12
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,735
Oome with me.

13
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,139
Princess, I'm beat.
Ask Mom, she'll help you.

14
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,439
No, I want to go with you.

15
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,772
Daddy's tired, Jasmine.

16
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,250
After school, ok?

17
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,121
No, I'll just do it by myseIf.

18
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,550
Hey...

19
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,190
I didn't get my dessert.

20
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,356
My dessert.

21
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,663
Thank you.

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,436
There.

23
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,507
If no one's home, leave
the invitations in the mailbox.

24
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,807
I know, Daddy.

25
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,442
I Iove you.

26
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,695
I need to sleep.
Mute the phone on yourway.

27
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,592
I'm onIy going in 15 minutes.
We have time.

28
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,359
Sylvie, I'm exhausted.

29
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,400
You can just lie there.
I'll take over.

30
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,715
Hi.

31
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,544
I brought Jasmine her homework.

32
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,241
What do you mean?

33
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,719
She wasn't at school this afternoon.
Is she sick?

34
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,448
No.

35
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,784
You didn't see her?.
- No.

36
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,589
Thanks.

37
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,625
Jasmine?

38
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,508
Jasmine?

39
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,172
Jasmine.

40
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,420
Why didn't they call?

41
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,026
They Ieft a message.

42
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,992
She wasn't at school after Iunch.

43
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,461
Didn't you answer?

44
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,758
I was asleep. You know.

45
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,461
Ok.

46
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,796
When did you wake up?

47
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,539
Around 2:30.

48
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,967
And you onIy listened to it now?

49
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,482
Do you normally drive her to school?

50
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,749
Yes.

51
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,587
Well, she often goes on her own.

52
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,888
Does she waIk with anyone,
a friend?

53
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,292
Not today.
- Not today?

54
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,593
How was she? What was she wearing?

55
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,999
She was wearing a pIaid skirt and...

56
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,663
...gray tights with boots.

57
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,903
Brown boots with...

58
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,771
She was carrying invitations.

59
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,810
Did she have a hat or a schoolbag?

60
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,377
Awhite coat with fur.
- She had a braid.

61
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,585
Thank you.

62
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,599
ShouId we follow her route to school?

63
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,791
Sure.

64
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,728
We couId go to the park,
ask her friends.

65
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,599
We can go right now.
- Yes.

66
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,576
In case she calls.

67
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,946
We'll find her.

68
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,422
We'll find her.

69
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,111
She's aIways with Ben,
who lives there.

70
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,115
We'll find her.
- Or in the fieId in back.

71
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,786
You go here, I'll go there.

72
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,047
She never does this.
She usually calls or...

73
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,858
Does she know peopIe there?

74
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,792
She has friends,
she's aIways with them.

75
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,496
We'll Iook over there.

76
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,558
Jasmine?

77
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,706
Yes?

78
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,476
Ok.

79
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,080
Dr Hamel, stay here. Dr Hamel.

80
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,483
Dr Hamel.

81
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,990
Dr Hamel, stop.

82
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,789
Don't go there, Dr Hamel.

83
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,029
Don't go there.

84
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,486
Don't go there.

85
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:30,723
Seven Days

86
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,124
Seven Days...

87
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,444
Dr Hamel?
Detective Sergeant Mercure speaking.

88
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,185
Sorry to bother you at this difficuIt time.

89
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,060
We think we've found
your little girI's murderer.

90
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,661
Murderer?.

91
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,402
We have solid material evidence.

92
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,806
Plus we analyzed the DNA...

93
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:10,711
...of the sperm we found.
lt matches the suspect's DNA.

94
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,153
ln my opinion the trial will be a formality.

95
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,560
Hello?

96
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,426
Dr Hamel?

97
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,473
Step aside, pIease. Step aside.

98
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,504
Mr. Lemaire?
- Do you have anything to say?

99
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:45,211
A new twist in the case
of 8-year- old Jasmine Hamel...

100
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,080
...found raped and murdered four days ago.

101
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,551
Already...

102
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,852
...the police have found enough evidence
to arrest a prime suspect.

103
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,460
He is a 31-year- old laborer...

104
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,755
...named Anthony Lemaire,

105
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,657
who moved to Drummondville
a few months ago.

106
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,297
He'd previously lived in St Hyacinthe,

107
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,869
where he was charged for sexual assault.

108
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,598
He was released for lack of evidence.

109
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,299
But now,
in the case of Jasmine Hamel,

110
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,172
the evidence seems more conclusive.

111
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,876
How Iong will he get?

112
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,483
About 15 to 25 years.

113
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,221
25 years.

114
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,386
Where are you going?

115
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,420
The hospital.

116
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,598
Work will do me good.

117
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:46,727
So soon?

118
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,009
Maybe you shouId go back to the gallery.

119
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,578
It'll help you forget.

120
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,948
I don't want to forget.

121
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,483
See you tonight.

122
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,003
This isn't for a friendly game of poker.

123
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,572
Not asking questions and keeping
your trap shut is part of the contract.

124
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,439
It sounds kind of suspicious.

125
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,946
This is a small town here, Mr...?

126
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,409
I toId you, it won't happen here.

127
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,447
How Iong can I think it over?

128
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,818
20 seconds.

129
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,919
There are other towns,
other handymen.

130
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,724
$25,000.

131
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:40,989
$20,000.

132
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,838
Apartment for rent...

133
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,152
How are you spending your days?

134
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,756
You know, I'm at the hospitaI.

135
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,495
That's not true.

136
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,837
I called.

137
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,771
I even Ieft messages on your cell.

138
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,872
Oh yeah...

139
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,408
You never listen to messages.

140
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,255
What I'm asking is simpIe.

141
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,991
For two minutes' work you pocket $10,000.

142
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,462
Think fast.

143
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,441
$5,000 now, $5,000 after.

144
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,760
$20,000, as agreed.

145
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,602
PIus $10,000 a day if you don't talk.

146
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,304
What?

147
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,879
Every day for a week
you'll get another $10K.

148
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,739
UnIess you talk.

149
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,650
If you talk, I'll know.

150
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,682
$10,000 a day?

151
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,693
You can be sure I won't talk.

152
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,659
We won't meet again.

153
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,674
day one...

154
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,103
Dan, are you aIright?

155
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,796
Wake up. Wake up.

156
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,205
Open your eyes, come on.

157
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,806
What is it?
- Oan I help?

158
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,772
I'm a doctor.

159
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,509
He bIacked out.
I don't know what's wrong.

160
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,826
Get him out, he needs air.

161
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,997
What happened?
- I dunno. He just fainted.

162
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,972
Hold him up, I'll get my bag.

163
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,467
Dan?

164
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,203
Dan, talk to me. Open your eyes.

165
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,472
Hey. Hey. Stop.

166
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,799
What are we doing here?

167
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,699
Where are we, fuck?

168
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,841
The driver is being questioned.

169
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,162
We located the van.

170
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,897
Your husband drugged him.

171
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,762
The driver Iost consciousness.

172
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,771
We don't know how he pulled it off.

173
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,400
What's he trying to do?

174
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,969
We expect to find Lemaire's corpse
within a few hours.

175
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,808
No, impossible.
That's not like Bruno.

176
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,745
So you don't know anything?

177
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,324
No.

178
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,260
You said your husband has been out a lot.

179
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,989
l thought he was going...

180
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,168
That he...

181
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,664
That he what?

182
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,396
I don't know.

183
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,540
Do you aIways know where your wife is?

184
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,272
My wife is dead.

185
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,831
You don't know where he might be hiding?

186
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,006
A hoteI, a country pIace, a cottage?

187
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,374
No.

188
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,778
We wanted to buy something
but we never got very far.

189
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,649
I want you to write down
everyone you know.

190
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,686
Relatives, friends, everyone.

191
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,015
We'll question his colleagues
at the hospitaI.

192
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,783
Ok.

193
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,057
You understand,
we have to tap your phone.

194
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,289
Shit.

195
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,459
Hey?

196
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,942
Hey?

197
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,022
Hey?

198
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,713
What's going on?

199
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,385
Why am I tied up like this?

200
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,657
What is this?

201
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,363
You bastard.

202
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,899
What do you want?

203
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,417
What's going on?

204
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,984
What do you want?

205
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,496
Who are you, dammit?

206
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,047
It wasn't me, man.

207
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,152
I swear, it wasn't me.

208
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,159
Wait till my trial, you'll see.

209
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,419
It wasn't me.

210
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,694
Man, Iook me in the eyes.

211
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,666
It wasn't me, fuck.

212
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,467
I've never seen your daughter.

213
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,638
I didn't do anything.

214
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,888
Untie me, we can talk.

215
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,623
Ok?

216
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,085
I'll help you.

217
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,362
I'll help you, man.

218
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,260
I'll help you find the reaI killer.

219
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,835
I hate pedophiles too,
just like you.

220
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,569
I hate the bastards.

221
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,303
What are you doing?

222
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,241
What are you gonna do?

223
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,107
Stop fucking around.

224
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,976
Stop joking.

225
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,575
Fuck.

226
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,883
I can't Iast like this.

227
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,413
I can't Iast.

228
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,336
Jesus Ohrist.

229
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,197
You're sick, fuck.

230
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,408
Shit.

231
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,011
Don't leave me like this.

232
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,064
Fuck you, you sick bastard.

233
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,250
Sick piece of shit.

234
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:41,524
The security cameras caught this right
after Lemaire entered the courthouse.

235
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,667
day two...

236
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,778
Have you found out who it is?

237
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,547
We're working on it.

238
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,823
Fuck.

239
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,451
Fuck you.

240
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,456
Fuck you. Goddammit.

241
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,468
Go to hell.

242
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,107
It wasn't me, shit.

243
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,177
It wasn't me, shit.

244
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,436
Goddammit.

245
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,573
You're committing a major injustice, man.

246
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,768
It's you who'll go to jail,
you asshoIe.

247
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,385
A stunning development
in the Jasmine Hamel case.

248
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,992
Her father, Bruno Hamel,
is believed...

249
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:01,393
...to have kidnapped the prime suspect.
We have no other details for now.

250
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,634
If I were Hamel,
I'd cut off his balls.

251
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,778
And make sure he was conscious
while I did.

252
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,893
Hello?

253
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,724
Yesterday l smashed his knee.

254
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,628
That's just the beginning.

255
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,835
lt's your turn.
Tell me what to do next.

256
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,703
I want you to stop and come home.

257
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,772
l was hoping you'd understand.

258
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,715
No one approves of what you're doing.

259
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,454
Yourfamily, your friends.

260
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,681
Fuck 'em.

261
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,550
It's for Jasmine.
I owe it to her.

262
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,656
You aIso think I owe it to her.

263
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,894
l didn't say that.

264
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,267
You aIso think I owe her a debt.

265
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,034
You have to come home, Bruno.

266
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,875
We'll help each other.

267
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,172
I hoped you'd see.

268
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,848
This is Detective Sergeant Mercure,
Dr Hamel.

269
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,920
If you turn yourseIf in now,
the mitigating circumstances...

270
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,647
...l'll turn myself in.

271
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,093
Next Friday, my daughter's birthday.

272
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,058
l'll kill him and then turn myself in.

273
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,495
We'll find you before.

274
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,596
I don't think so.

275
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,772
You're not a vioIent man, Dr Hamel.

276
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,533
Not deep down. I know it.

277
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,270
What else do you know?
- What you're feeling.

278
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,916
I'd be surprised.

279
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,716
My wife was shot six months ago
in a grocery...

280
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,653
...by a young thief, for 58 bucks.

281
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,030
Didn't you want to kill him?

282
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,189
Yes.

283
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,060
But l knew it was pointless.

284
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,294
Where is he?

285
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,004
ln prison, where he belongs.

286
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,776
And that satisfies you?

287
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,847
At night, lying in your big empty bed,

288
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,683
does it console you to know
your wife's killer is in jail?

289
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,155
Does it make your life more bearable?

290
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,136
Bye, Sylvie.

291
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,323
The trace failed.

292
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,060
Wait till I get out of here.

293
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,834
Wait till I get out of here, asshoIe.

294
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,742
Fuck you.

295
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,760
Fuck off.

296
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,785
day three

297
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,097
PIeau, it's Mercure.

298
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,905
My ring rolled under the door.
Oan you get it?

299
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,977
Why don't you do it?

300
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,977
It's in the bedroom.

301
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,140
Without my ring, I can't face it.

302
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,813
I put the board back like it was.

303
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:19,978
Thanks.

304
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,149
Herve, you shouId...

305
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,501
A Drummondville eIectronics salesman
recognized Hamel.

306
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:36,067
The doctor bought $4000 worth
of stuff, incIuding a Iaptop.

307
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,364
A Iaptop?

308
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,864
Ok.

309
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,504
I didn't know why he wanted
to get in, I swear.

310
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,375
It onIy took a minute.
He went in, came out...

311
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,381
I saw Bruno once at the hospitaI.

312
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,018
I didn't expect him
to come to work so soon.

313
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,056
Hamel paid me to crack the van door.

314
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,491
There's not a Iock I can't open.

315
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,961
SurgicaI instruments,

316
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,363
antibiotics,

317
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,062
even an artificiaI respirator.

318
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,071
They all went missing Iast week.

319
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,038
After he paid me,

320
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,010
he sat in the parking Iot...

321
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,980
He's such a caIm man, so gentIe.

322
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,985
I must say,

323
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,222
I find it hard to believe.

324
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,184
You're not gonna charge me.

325
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,857
I Iearned my Iesson.

326
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,555
Besides, I was cooI,
I toId you everything I know.

327
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,396
It's your tum to be cooI.

328
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,093
SeriousIy, I have to get to school.

329
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,051
The food's so I Iast Ionger?

330
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,004
I'm telling the truth.

331
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,034
Leave me aIone.

332
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,071
Want me to confess, is that it?

333
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,980
I did it.

334
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,355
I did it, man. I confess.

335
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,125
But I'm sorry.

336
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,932
Shit, I'm so sorry.

337
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,297
So sorry.

338
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,602
I don't know why I did it.

339
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,544
I'm sorry, man.

340
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,947
Ow.

341
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,121
I'm sorry.

342
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,784
Ok?

343
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,799
I confessed, shit.

344
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,440
Isn't that what you wanted?

345
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,572
I'll say it again to the judge.

346
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,615
I'll be behind bars for years,
you can be sure.

347
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,151
I confessed, shit.

348
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:45,686
Stop.

349
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:46,829
Stop.

350
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,338
I'll go to jail for life.

351
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,369
What more do you want?

352
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,818
I'll do anything you want.
Anything.

353
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,119
AIright, to summarize.

354
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:26,960
Hamel wants to torture the guy
undisturbed. Where does he go?

355
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,690
A cottage? He doesn't have one.

356
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,264
A moteI room?

357
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,729
We'll keep searching,
but in a radius of 100 km,

358
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,599
there's a shitIoad of 'em.

359
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:41,309
A moteI's not the pIace to torture
a guy, too many peopIe around.

360
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,713
So back to a cottage.

361
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,839
Did he break into a friend's pIace?

362
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:51,044
We checked all the cottages
of his colleagues, friends, relatives.

363
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,581
AIright.

364
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,062
Maybe he rented one?

365
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,966
That's risky too.

366
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,402
Even if he paid cash,
the owner might remember him.

367
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,543
That leaves the abandoned cabin
in the woods.

368
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,806
Did he find it by accident?
Did he have it built?

369
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,678
In the woods... Where?

370
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,415
Ohrist, we got nothing.

371
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,887
Does it really matter?

372
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:31,016
After all, Lemaire's a child rapist.

373
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,926
Why shouId we bust our ass...

374
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,498
...to save a guy who murders little girIs?

375
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,729
It's not Lemaire I want to save.

376
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,146
day four

377
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,479
There's no point torturing me.

378
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,822
It won't bring back your little girI.

379
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,447
After you finish me off,

380
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,613
what'll you do?

381
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,216
Only three days left
till the deadline runs out...

382
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,875
...and still no sign of Bruno Hamel.

383
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:47,020
How is the doctor's wife,
Dr Sylvie Berube,

384
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,282
coping with this difficult situation?

385
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,791
Jean Fafard spoke with her.

386
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:56,159
lt's hard. l have nothing to say.

387
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,164
You don't approve of his actions?

388
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,502
l think...

389
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,699
...l think that his grief has driven him mad.

390
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,275
I'm sorry.

391
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,039
Mrs Berube?

392
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,741
ln the Middle East...

393
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,509
What made you tell the press
I've gone crazy?

394
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,518
I'm not crazy,
I've never been so Iucid.

395
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,348
Oome back. Stop all this.

396
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,750
How can you ask that?

397
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,986
How can you ask that?

398
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,095
If you Ioved Jasmine,
you'd know this is for her.

399
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,855
You're doing it out of guilt.

400
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,624
You finally said it.

401
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,927
You think it's my fault, right?

402
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,660
It's you who...
- Who what?

403
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,236
You could've gone with her.

404
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,634
But you wanted to fuck.

405
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:42,540
While you were having your orgasm,
your little girI was being raped.

406
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,375
If you'd answered the phone or
listened to the message, maybe...

407
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,039
Maybe. Screw your maybes.

408
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:52,847
ShouId we just hide in a comer and cry?
I'm doing something, Sylvie.

409
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,449
Argh.

410
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,373
I'm doing something, Sylvie.

411
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,806
They're really going at it.

412
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,134
He was calling from St Julie.

413
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,841
Trace the call. Now.

414
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:23,510
He's Iosing it.
- Anyone wouId in his shoes.

415
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,484
Fine, but we have to capitalize on it.

416
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:32,258
Ooncentrate on cottage
rentaI agencies around St Julie.

417
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:35,397
Search every home recentIy occupied,
one by one.

418
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,965
Every day of my life...

419
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,260
...has been marked by vioIence.

420
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,201
And more of it...

421
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,933
...isn't going to help me.

422
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,143
When I was a kid

423
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,909
I was abused and beaten.

424
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,645
I know what it is to suffer.

425
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,862
I need help, man.

426
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,860
Help, not more vioIence.

427
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,007
What's that?

428
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,645
What is it?

429
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,180
Ourare?

430
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,953
It's to...

431
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,726
Curare.: paralyses the motor system
but not consciousness.

432
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,613
Don't do it.

433
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,604
Don't do it.

434
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,062
I can't take it.

435
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,039
You're worse than me.

436
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,069
You're worse than me.

437
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,674
day five

438
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,496
I figured out what you did.

439
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,765
Fuck yourfood.

440
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:01,207
I'm not gonna shit out of
my stomach again.

441
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:07,912
So?

442
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,814
What do you got pIanned now?

443
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,781
How you gonna amuse yourseIf?

444
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,354
Go on,

445
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,358
I can't wait to see.

446
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,800
Worst thing is, you don't even
seem to be enjoying yourseIf.

447
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,451
Finished aIready?

448
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:46,240
Running Iow on motivation?

449
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,638
I'll help you, ok?

450
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,578
Your daughter wasn't the onIy one.

451
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,123
Those little sIuts...

452
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,727
I killed three others too.

453
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,694
Marion HouIe,

454
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,464
Laurie Thibodeau...

455
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,368
...and OharIotte Masson.

456
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,569
I fucked 'em...

457
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,972
...and then I killed 'em,

458
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:24,772
all three.

459
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,987
But your little girl,

460
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,791
Jasmine...

461
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,388
She was the best.

462
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,696
She was the prettiest.
ReaI pretty.

463
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,659
Fucking tease.

464
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,533
The way she was dressed.

465
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,535
She deserved to get her cunt reamed.

466
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,873
While I was fucking her,

467
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,510
she kept calling you.

468
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,446
She said,

469
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,290
'Daddy. Daddy.'

470
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,191
Where were you?

471
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,727
Where were you?

472
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,807
Kill me.

473
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,032
Kill me.

474
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,737
Herve? It's Hamel on two.
He wants to talk to you.

475
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,686
Yes, Dr Hamel?

476
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,759
You didn't answer last time.

477
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,396
What was the question?

478
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,892
The fact that your wife's murderer
is in prison,

479
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,304
does that make life more bearable?

480
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,136
No.

481
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,545
Too bad we didn't talk before.

482
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,553
It's too bad, yeah.

483
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,055
I don't know why I called.
I shouIdn't have.

484
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,296
That's not true.

485
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,763
You know why.

486
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,001
l can help you.

487
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,703
You can't even help yourseIf.

488
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,843
You're drowning, Dr Hamel.

489
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,008
And you're starting to realize it.

490
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,142
Yeah.

491
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,090
Let me sink.

492
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,400
The trace worked.
We'll be there in 2 minutes.

493
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,900
BoIduc and his men are aIready in the area.

494
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,703
How precise is it?

495
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,673
Within 50 meters. They onIy need
to search a few houses.

496
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,306
MontreaI.

497
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,249
No.

498
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,483
We've got the address.
BoIduc's on his way.

499
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,800
Marion HouIe.

500
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,136
Oharlotte Masson.

501
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,212
Laurie Thibodeau.

502
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:54,571
Yes.

503
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,039
Yes, Bruno Hamel.
Oheck the names, you'll see.

504
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,111
Police.

505
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,427
Nobody here.

506
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,880
A remote-controlled computer?.
What do you mean?

507
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,745
Where's he calling from?

508
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,116
We're identifying his ISP.

509
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,952
We'll call them,
it shouIdn't take Iong.

510
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:21,395
Yes.

511
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:25,530
It's up north in Oharette.

512
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,607
He subscribed using a fake name.

513
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,437
Get the IocaI guys in there.

514
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:30,600
Yes.

515
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,123
We're at the address.

516
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:50,458
There's a laptop and a cell phone,
but no Hamel.

517
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:52,858
He's hiding somewhere else.

518
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:23,991
Hello.

519
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,337
With the gas?

520
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,407
$46.19.

521
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,920
I know who you are.

522
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,196
I'm with you.

523
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,636
Thanks.

524
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,660
You've been Iooking near Oharette.

525
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,796
Because that's where he's hiding.

526
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,195
He called from there,
but he may not be there.

527
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,062
day 6
- He has to be.

528
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,831
He called his wife 15 minutes
after seeing her on TV.

529
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:23,070
In 15 minutes on a dirt road
you can't drive more than 25 kms.

530
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,034
Ok.

531
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,545
But it's still a huge area.

532
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,083
There are tons of cottages.

533
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,214
We'll put all our men on it.

534
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,356
We traced all Hamel's calls
to the Oharette pIace.

535
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,221
He called TVATV just before we got there.

536
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:41,620
Who did he speak to?

537
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,762
We never thought they'd find
our little Laurie's killer.

538
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,861
Knowing that Bruno Hamel
has him prisoner,

539
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,903
we not only approve, we urge him on.

540
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,244
l want you...

541
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,578
...to make him suffer, Dr Hamel.

542
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:04,110
Make him suffer as much
as he made my Marion suffer.

543
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,047
One person disagrees,

544
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:10,089
the third victim's mother,
Mrs Diane Masson,

545
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,489
a widow who raised her Charlotte
alone in St Hyacinthe...

546
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,525
...until Anthony Lemaire ruined her life.

547
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:20,067
l think what Dr Hamel is doing is pointless.

548
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,962
lt won't help him, or me,
or anyone.

549
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,840
For me, that man doesn't exist.

550
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,902
That horrible event happened 4 years ago.

551
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,413
l went on with my life.

552
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,315
I'm all alone,
but I'm alive all the same.

553
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,525
St Hyacinthe.

554
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:48,885
Yes.

555
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,389
Diane Masson.

556
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,709
What you said on TV is disgusting.

557
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,653
Why did you bring me here?

558
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:36,689
For you, that man doesn't exist?

559
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,031
We'll see about that.

560
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,167
I don't want to see him.

561
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,235
I don't want to.

562
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:49,540
No.

563
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,172
I don't want to.

564
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,049
Let me go. Let me go.

565
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:57,479
I said Iet me go.

566
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,119
You bastard.

567
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:04,885
I don't want to go.

568
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,458
I don't want to see him.

569
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:09,822
No.

570
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,868
- Look at him.

571
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,766
Look at him.

572
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:21,135
That man doesn't exist?
He doesn't exist?

573
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,248
Look at him.

574
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,090
He doesn't exist?

575
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,527
Go on.

576
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,099
Go ahead.

577
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:52,102
I know you want to. Finish him off.

578
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,804
Oome on.

579
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:58,237
Now's the time.
Do it, finish him off.

580
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,904
Kill him.
- I won't.

581
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,175
Kill the bastard.
- I won't.

582
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,046
Kill the fucker.
- No.

583
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,744
Finish him off.

584
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,442
I'll give you time to realize he exists.

585
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:31,943
Let me out. Let me out.

586
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:34,673
Let me out.
I won't do it, I toId you.

587
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:35,781
PIease.

588
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,913
PIease, Iet me out.

589
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,723
Let me out, pIease.

590
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,991
PIease.

591
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,558
PIease, Iet me out.

592
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:40,270
I'd erased that man from my life.

593
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,678
You can't.
- Yes, you can.

594
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,720
It's hard,

595
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,423
it takes Iong, but you can.

596
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,988
By bringing me here,
you destroyed that.

597
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,096
It's like...

598
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,877
It's like you killed my girl a second time.

599
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,746
Every time you torture that man,

600
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,512
you kill your own daughter.

601
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:58,963
Ow.

602
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:38,708
Hey.

603
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,552
Take me to the police.

604
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:59,858
Ooncentrate on waterfront houses,
by a Iake or river.

605
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,262
Forget rentaI cottages.

606
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:06,167
Masson's convinced Hamel
broke into a private home.

607
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:10,376
He's using Masson's car, a red Saturn.
We have the license pIate.

608
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:22,045
day seven

609
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,070
I'll go there.

610
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,228
It's an hour away.

611
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:16,308
I want to be in Oharette when
they find him. Keep me posted.

612
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:04,515
Fuck.

613
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:16,095
Oall Mercure. We found him.

614
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:41,583
Detective Mercure?

615
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,229
Sergeant Ooutu.

616
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:45,128
We just called the SWAT team.

617
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:46,561
We'll move in now.

618
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:48,890
Yeah.

619
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:51,503
I don't want...
- He won't just wait for us.

620
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:54,268
There's been no movement?

621
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:56,932
Nothing. Maybe he's still asleep.

622
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,780
Oall an ambulance. Tell them no siren.

623
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:09,818
Is this Hamel's hideout?
You found him? Is Lemaire dead?

624
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,117
No comment yet. Step back.
- Oome on.

625
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,990
Keep those guys far away.

626
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:17,824
And make sure
they keep their mouths shut.

627
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:20,324
Here we go.

628
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:27,198
Is he trapped?

629
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:29,198
He's trapped.

630
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,058
It's her birthday today.

631
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,361
She wouId have been 9.

632
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:43,739
Bruno Hamel?

633
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:46,741
This is Detective Sergeant Herve Mercure.

634
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:48,380
You're surrounded.

635
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,576
Oome out with your hands up.

636
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:02,691
Bruno Hamel.

637
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:04,864
Oome out with your hands up.

638
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:44,200
Drop your gun.

639
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:09,420
Dr Bruno Hamel,

640
01:46:09,596 --> 01:46:13,896
you are under arrest for kidnapping
and attempted murder.

641
01:46:14,067 --> 01:46:18,470
You have a right to immediate
Legal counseI. Do you understand?

642
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:20,128
Do you understand?

643
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:21,739
You have the right to remain silent.

644
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:24,843
Anything you say can be used against you.

645
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:35,982
I didn't kill him.

646
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,549
Dr Hamel?

647
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,652
Do you still think vengeance
is the right answer?

648
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:46,054
No.

649
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:48,967
So you regret what you've done?

650
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,631
No.
