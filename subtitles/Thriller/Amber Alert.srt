2
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:55,293
Okay, Sam, you ready?
I'm gonna mic you up.

3
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,729
Caleb, thanks
for helping out, man.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,664
Thank you.

5
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:01,666
You're a good little brother,

6
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,532
even though you're adopted.

7
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,093
- Is he adopted?
- No!

8
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,539
- Test the microphone.
- Okay. Test, one, two...

9
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,599
This is the beginnings
of Sam and Nate...

10
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:13,202
- Yes.
- ...and we have spent

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,214
many years together
as best friends...

12
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:17,045
- Yes.
- ...and now, we're gonna

13
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,347
continue our adventure.
- Our journey.

14
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,944
- Some... wait, wait.
- Wait, wait.

15
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,388
So, this is what
I do for a living.

16
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,393
It's a family-owned business,
and you'll see here

17
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:30,021
we have a ton
of different kinds of fish,

18
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,621
some morays, some red fins...

19
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,291
There he goes,
Vincent. Okay.

20
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:39,031
Okay, so you take this,
you put it in the bag,

21
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,970
and you fill it up.

22
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,908
This gives it oxygen
so that they can live in there

23
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,537
for about 24 hours
while they're traveling.

24
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:50,310
And you take it under
here, you seal it,

25
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,317
and it's all ready
to go. So, that is...

26
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,478
- " That's my life"
- ...what my day job is.

27
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,078
" What a great job."

28
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,987
You wanna do
a dance number on here?

29
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,994
" Oh, a-di-dee-di di-dee-di-dee
di-dee-di-dee-di."

30
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,087
" We're pirates two,
we're pirates three."

31
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,529
" We're pirates four and five."

32
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,124
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey.

33
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,669
Please get off the structure.

34
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,967
- Sorry about that.
- There you go.

35
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,563
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,201
Okay, so we want to show you
how resourceful we can be.

37
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,575
We're very resourceful.
Winners are resourceful.

38
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:22,046
- So we have this thing called free time!
- Free time!

39
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,412
Yes, free time.

40
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,213
What we do is we see how
much fun we can have

41
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,481
and how long we can go
without spending one dollar.

42
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,147
So, when we come
play putt-putt,

43
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,987
we bring our own putters,
and then I do this.

44
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,033
Balls galore!

45
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,238
Is that a good way
to end it, Caleb?

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,349
Caleb, did you know that you
sister was such an athlete?

47
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,318
So, we come here
to blow off steam, to...

48
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,088
if we're upset about something,

49
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,221
we can come and just hit the
balls and let it all out.

50
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:13,266
It's part of our free time.

51
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,995
So, we try to see
how long we can go

52
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,400
without spending any money,

53
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,131
and we know the guy's here,

54
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,196
so they let us hit, and...

55
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:22,536
it's a lot of fun.

56
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:25,169
I really love going
to batting cages.

57
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,745
You want more?

58
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,185
Should we just do
our singing first?

59
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,279
It'd be another great way
for us to express ourselves.

60
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:39,154
Not only that, but it'd be
a great chance to travel.

61
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,693
- Sam here...
- I've never left Arizona.

62
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,422
- Never left Arizona.
- Not to say...

63
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,690
I've been down to Tucson,

64
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,095
and I've been up north,

65
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,531
but I've never left Arizona.

66
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,466
" She's never left Arizona."

67
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,664
And I really would love
the opportunity to travel.

68
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,606
" She'd love
the opportunity to travel."

69
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,166
It would be the first time
I'd get to explore the world.

70
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:01,441
" Explore the world,
circumnavigation."

71
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,347
And I would get to do it
with my best friend,

72
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,045
so that would be even more fun.

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,715
" Best friends
potty-trained together"

74
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,056
I'm pretty sure I was
potty-trained before we met.

75
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:18,586
Okay, I w... I wasn't.
I wasn't.

76
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,259
" Sam and Nate."

77
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:26,533
" Sam, the best woman
and the best man."

78
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,130
Bam!

79
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:35,508
Sam, you are
so beautiful blurry.

80
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,708
Why are you so blurry?

81
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:38,683
'Cause you're an idiot.

82
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:41,482
- Oh! Watch it, buddy.
- Okay, well, let's go. We have one left.

83
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,517
Put this on you real quick.

84
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,827
Uh...

85
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,836
This is not
an interesting shot at all.

86
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,872
Do you mind if we
go somewhere else?

87
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,874
Um, let's go
to the go-karts.

88
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:06,343
- No...
- How about Camelback Mountain?

89
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,293
- We could hike up it...
- Why are you laughing?

90
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:10,578
- ...and do talking.
- Sounds good. Let's do that.

91
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,244
Okay. Let's do it.
Go grab the car.

92
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,480
" Onward."

93
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:16,817
" Ho."

94
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,755
As we're going,
we're going to finish

95
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,349
filling out our questionnaire.

96
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:21,826
We have about, like, 20 pages

97
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,886
 worth of stuff that we have to fill out.
- No... No...

98
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,659
- Too bad. You have to.
- I have been procrastinating for the past month.

99
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,633
I don't want to fill
those questions out.

100
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:30,169
- Okay.
- There are too many.

101
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,956
- We're doing it anyway.
- All right, fine.

102
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,700
"What is the worst"...
I know, they always

103
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,570
have the hardest
questions, too.

104
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,577
"What is the worst experience you've
had with your teammate?"

105
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:41,409
Uh, let's see,
I remember that one time

106
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:44,177
you came over
and you weren't invited,

107
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,241
and you just knocked
on the door, and I...

108
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,913
- Sorry, I...
- "Excuse me, I just got out of the shower."

109
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,888
Um, no, it's hard
to say with you.

110
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,221
You're so, like,
little miss perfect.

111
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,490
I don't know, like, what's the worst
thing you've ever done to me?

112
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,825
Oh, oh, that's easy for me.

113
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,865
Uh, the time you got so drunk

114
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,197
I had to baby-sit you
for, like, six hours.

115
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,896
- When was that?
- Okay, so Nate got so drunk,

116
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,802
and we went
to a movie earlier,

117
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:08,363
and so he had eaten popcorn,

118
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,409
and he puked it up and
then he tried to eat...

119
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,502
- I did not! That's sick!
That's gross!

120
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,173
- You don't even remember anything from that night!
- I did not do that.

121
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:18,649
- Don't film me eating this candy bar.
- I got...

122
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,652
I got her that 'cause...

123
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,318
It's gonna make her
big and fat,

124
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,257
and then she won't have
any choice but to date me.

125
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,955
There'll be so much more
of you to love!

126
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,859
"If a genii granted you
one wish, what would it be?"

127
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,901
- Friends.
- Okay, if the genii granted one wish...

128
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,460
- Uh, that's hard.
- Maybe some better clothes.

129
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,835
- Okay. Okay.
- One wish.

130
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,840
- Uh, my own theme park.
- Okay.

131
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,705
I would want
my own amusement park,

132
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,506
and I would build
roller coasters

133
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,671
that were, like,
themed after my friends.

134
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,977
Like, you would have
your own roller coaster.

135
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,846
- Awesome.
- The Sammy Roller Coaster.

136
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,352
- I'll come and sign autographs.
- Yeah, definitely.

137
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,411
And it would be awesome
because it would be

138
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:57,979
really, like, curvy like you.

139
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:00,787
- Thank you.
- But it also will reflect your mood swings.

140
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,227
So, there would be one part
that would be like, "Aah! ".

141
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:07,266
- And then another part would be...
- Aw, how sad. Amber Alert.

142
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,823
What's an Amber Alert?

143
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,996
It's when a creepy dude puts
you in the back of his truck

144
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,663
and tries
to tickle your wiener.

145
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,334
- Ha ha ha...
- Dude, you are nasty.

146
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,240
Okay, I think
my one wish would be...

147
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,836
It's probably
your scout master!

148
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:24,315
- That's not funny! That's not funny!
- That's just a bonus.

149
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,011
- What... hey.
- Next question is...

150
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:27,677
Wait. Sammy,
hang on a second.

151
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,381
- Wait just one second.
- Okay.

152
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:30,979
I'm not... okay.
Is that a...

153
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,547
that's a gray Honda, right?

154
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,923
It looks...
more blackish?

155
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,791
Steel, maybe?
Steel?

156
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,525
Okay, um, pretty sure
that's probably a gray Honda.

157
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,965
- What reality show...
- That's a gray Honda there.

158
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,334
- What reality show contestant do you relate with?
- That is a gray Honda.

159
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,532
- That's a gray Honda.
- Okay, good job.

160
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,303
Oh, okay, well, on...
on the thing,

161
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,675
on the sign thing
it said gray Honda.

162
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,839
Are you trying to get
out of these questions?

163
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,576
- Yes, I am.
- We're almost done!

164
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,278
I definitely am trying
to get out of the questions.

165
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:03,049
Stay focused. What reality show
contestant do you relate to?

166
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,521
- I don't...
- Come on!

167
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,956
I don't relate to reality...

168
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,687
first of all reality shows
are the furthest thing away

169
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,661
from reality you could
possibly get.

170
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,891
There's nothing about
reality on those shows.

171
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,456
Okay, if you had to pick one...

172
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,001
and I'm saying
that's a gray Honda,

173
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,559
And the sign said gray Honda.

174
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,468
Do you know how many
gray Honda's there are?

175
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,302
That's probably
the most common car

176
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:22,568
in the whole entire world.

177
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,007
- All right, okay.
- If you had to pick

178
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:25,908
the most-selling car
in the world, that's it.

179
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,004
Okay, but what if that's the one
the sign is talking about?

180
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,049
Okay, the chances
are very, very slim.

181
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,549
- I will bet you...
- Okay...

182
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,552
- Okay, I will bet you...
- Reality show!

183
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,020
You'll bet me that you'll
finish the survey right now?

184
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,420
I mean, maybe.

185
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,980
I mean, that's
kind of a big bet,

186
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:41,652
I don't think the sign
said what color it was.

187
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,595
Okay, what reality show
contestant do you relate with?

188
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:48,566
Uh, fine!
Flavor Flave!

189
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,966
Okay, if another teammate...

190
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,628
I think that's the gray Honda.

191
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,695
There's no way
that's the Honda.

192
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,707
I will bet you
a million dollars.

193
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:58,676
I will bet you you stop asking
me these stupid questions.

194
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:02,010
- If that's the gray Honda from the sign,
- All right, stay focused!

195
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,948
- Come on, we're almost done with this.
- Sam! Sam, wait!

196
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,885
- Stay focused!
- No, Sam, I don't want to do this anymore.

197
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,819
Why am I wasting tape on this?

198
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,754
- Who wants to watch...
- Shh! Listen.

199
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:16,523
If this is the car, then you have
to stop asking me these questions.

200
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,393
Okay, if this is the car,
you can...

201
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,728
- Okay.
- ...I will throw these out the window.

202
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,461
Throw them
out the window. Yes!

203
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,628
Okay, if this is
the gray Honda on the sign...

204
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,968
Okay, but until then,
we have to stay focused.

205
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,373
- Okay, well, look...
- ...if another team...

206
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,411
drops...

207
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:37,716
- That is the car.
- That's the car.

208
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:40,116
Wait, wait.

209
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,886
What do you want?
What should I do?

210
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,823
- Don't get too close.
- I'm not, I'm not.

211
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,793
- I'm just looking at the license.
- What if that is it?

212
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,556
That is it.
That's the license plate.

213
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,063
That's exactly
what the sign said.

214
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,530
It's the same license plate.

215
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,930
Okay, let me call...

216
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,866
That's the same
as the license plate.

217
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,597
That's the same car!
That's it!

218
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,468
Okay, okay,
I'm calling the police.

219
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,633
All right, fine.
He's probably whatever.

220
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,574
He's probably...

221
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,045
It's probably the, um...

222
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,776
like a custody battle or
something, you know what I mean?

223
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,114
It's probably, like, a parent
who wants custody of their kid,

224
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,086
and, you know,
they're just fighting.

225
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,520
It's not like it's like,
you know, serious.

226
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,490
Well, it could be
very, very serious.

227
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,584
- Should I keep taping?
- Samantha Green.

228
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,653
- We're traveling west on the 60...
- You got it?

229
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,722
I feel like we're
on Cops right now.

230
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,632
Okay, I think we see
the Amber Alert car.

231
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,693
No, no, no,
we do see the Amber Alert car.

232
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,068
This is the Amber Alert car.

233
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,505
Yes, gray.
Yes. Yes!

234
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,770
Okay. Um...

235
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:39,539
You feel like Cops, buddy?

236
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:40,738
Um, how fast is it going?

237
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,075
- Sixty-five.
- About 65.

238
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,740
Kind of shot like Cops, yeah.

239
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,147
This is Officer Riley.

240
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,152
No, he's going pretty calm,
not erratic at all.

241
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,847
I've been doing this beat
for 20 years.

242
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,821
- Watch the road!
- Just... will you drive?

243
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,118
- I'm all right.
- Be safe!

244
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,591
- I am!
- Okay, yes.

245
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,719
So, should we follow it?
What should we do?

246
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:58,593
Should we try and get
in front of it?

247
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:02,725
Okay, okay.
We won't. Okay. Okay.

248
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,134
Um, okay.

249
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:08,667
- No, we can't see anything inside the...
- Time to switch out the battery.

250
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,471
If we want to, we can just
follow it at a safe distance.

251
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,637
Okay, well, then,
we're not gonna do that.

252
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,113
We got a lot of stuff
we need to do,

253
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,978
so we're not gonna
follow it, obviously.

254
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,881
We're not police officers,
so, whatever.

255
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,911
No, we have to follow it.
Get in the right lane.

256
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,481
What do you mean
we're gonna follow it?

257
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,022
Get in the right lane.
We have to follow it.

258
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,682
No, we don't.
We're not policemen, Sam.

259
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,157
They said we could
as long as...

260
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:29,751
They said...
they said that we could,

261
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,763
but we don't have to
if we don't want to.

262
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,662
Get in the right lane.
One more over.

263
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,030
- Oh, my god.
- One more over.

264
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,035
Sam, this is...
this is not a good idea.

265
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,571
This is our civic duty,
or our responsibility.

266
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,970
Oh, my god.

267
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,507
Our civic duty?

268
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,634
I mean, to be good
members of the community.

269
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,075
Sam, it's probably some dude

270
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,045
who has a custody battle
over their kid!

271
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,775
It's probably a mom or a dad...

272
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,783
We don't know the story,
and it's not our job...

273
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,182
like you said, we're not cops.

274
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,152
It's not our job to find
out what happened,

275
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:56,779
it's just our job... we
saw it, we're following.

276
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,790
It's not our job to follow it!

277
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,053
- It's not our job.
- We can! They said we can at a safe distance.

278
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,560
Look, just drive the car.

279
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,186
You called the cops.
That's all we can do.

280
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,527
I mean, how long is it gonna take
for them to get here, anyway?

281
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,998
Okay, there... he's...
bah-bah-bah-bah!

282
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,865
- What? Aw, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

283
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,837
You... you said
you called the cops, right?

284
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:14,566
- Yeah.
- Okay, well then...

285
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,074
- They said...
- They'll be here any minute, right?

286
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,976
Well, they said there was
a ton of calls right now,

287
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:21,980
and so it could take
up to 15 minutes.

288
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:25,176
- What?!
- They're probably just eating doughnuts.

289
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,913
Well, I don't want to follow
this guy for 15 minutes.

290
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,648
All right, when you look inside

291
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,690
and it looks like
it's, like, nothing...

292
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:33,952
You stay normal, and I
will try to look around.

293
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,824
Maybe it's, like, a little old lady
or something and it's a mistake...

294
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,625
can we please just
go about our business?

295
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,188
Little old ladies
could kidnap kids, too.

296
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:41,665
Caleb, get down!

297
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,292
No, it's fine.
He can't see me.

298
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,734
He's fine.
He's fine!

299
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,704
- Can't see a thing.
- He's fine.

300
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,865
It's tinted.
I can't see anything, either.

301
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,306
I know, I can't see anything.

302
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,936
Okay, let me call again.

303
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,947
I'll tell them that he got off.

304
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,607
- Okay.
- So they know.

305
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,583
Traveling south, we think.

306
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,846
You think this is south?

307
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,081
On... McClintock.

308
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:04,953
Okay.

309
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,083
Ask them how long
it's gonna take.

310
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,720
How long is it gonna take
for you guys to get here?

311
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,262
We're right here...

312
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,991
I mean, we think
this is the car.

313
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,794
This is the car.
This is the car.

314
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,859
It's the car, and we got
shit we need to do today.

315
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,632
So... and I'm not
a policeman.

316
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,297
- Shh!
- I'm not a... I'm not a police officer!

317
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:23,706
- I don't care what she hears.
- All right, thank you.

318
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,674
Fifty, right? But I think he's
going way faster than that.

319
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,338
Okay, well, make sure
you get up there.

320
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:31,383
I am not gonna get... I'm not
gonna break the speed limit.

321
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,611
- You can just... ugh!
- I'm not gonna break the speed limit because...

322
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,916
You're gonna lose him if
you don't get up closer.

323
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,286
Do you know how many points I
have on my license already, Sam?

324
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,222
Get up closer.
I'll take the ticket.

325
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,193
- I have got so many points!
- Just hurry up!

326
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,195
- I'll tell... them.
- All right, I'm driving faster.

327
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,753
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

328
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,731
- I can still...
- You're gonna lose him!

329
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,926
I can still see him.

330
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,366
Do you not care if we lose him?

331
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,028
- If we...
- Do you understand...

332
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,629
- Sam!
- Do you understand what is at stake here?

333
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,368
No, I don't.
Please explain it to me.

334
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,706
This is not like...
this could be anyone.

335
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,406
This could be a little kid all
by themselves in that car.

336
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,745
- Yeah?
- A little kid that could be molested and murdered.

337
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,250
- It's a stepchild.
- A little kid

338
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,310
with their whole life
in front of them,

339
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:11,049
and we are the one
in between this kid

340
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,648
getting murdered
and killed or not.

341
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,921
No, I don't...
I totally disagree with that.

342
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,259
I think you're blowing this
way out of proportion.

343
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,992
Don't get so close to it!

344
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,432
You're getting... blowing
this way out of proportion.

345
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,264
I think it's better
if we stay back, anyway,

346
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,032
'cause then he won't
be able to...

347
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,868
he can probably see the camera!
We're filming him!

348
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,931
Yeah, Caleb, don't
let him see you.

349
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,034
- He can't see me.
- Okay, he's turning. I'm going straight.

350
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,942
No! No! Go left!
Are you freaking kidding me?

351
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,878
- Go left!
- All right, hang on a second.

352
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,439
- Oh, my gosh, don't lose him!
- I'm fine. We're fine.

353
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:40,118
Whoa! We're fine.
We're fine. We're fine.

354
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,448
Oh, my gosh, watch that.

355
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,420
- We're fine. We're fine.
- Oh, my gosh!

356
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:44,979
We're fine.
We're fine.

357
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,082
We're fine. It's just
a little bumpy road.

358
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,252
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
We're gonna lose him!

359
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,125
It's better if we stay back.

360
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,892
That was stupid!

361
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,264
Just stay on the road
and follow him!

362
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:58,098
Do you not care
about little kids?

363
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,434
Do you not care? Do you
have no heart at all?

364
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,371
Of course I care
about little kids!

365
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,432
You like kids getting
molested and murdered?

366
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,977
I hate that!
That's horrible!

367
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,740
Are you trying to help
this guy molest...

368
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:08,939
Of course I'm not
trying to help him!

369
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,141
Just stop arguing!

370
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:11,342
Where did they go?
They're gone!

371
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,112
Right there, right there!

372
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,846
- It's a yellow light. I can't.
- Oh, my gosh! Hurry!

373
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,911
Aw, shit.
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

374
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,183
Nate, you're gonna kill us!

375
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,054
Just hold on.
Aw, shit.

376
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:22,924
Oh, my gosh. Nate,
what are you doing?!

377
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,761
I'm trying to follow him
so you don't yell at me!

378
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,163
We just ran that red light.

379
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:32,000
I swear to God,
if I get pulled over

380
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,130
...that Amber back there
it'll be your fault,

381
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,401
and you're gonna pay for my
ticket if I get a ticket!

382
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,067
Just drive like
a normal person...

383
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,338
I am driving like
a normal person,

384
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,879
but you're yelling at me!

385
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,141
Won't you get up there
a little bit closer?!

386
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,945
We're freaking following
him a mile away.

387
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,282
Swear to God if I get
a ticket because of that,

388
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:52,017
- If there was a camera...
- I cannot believe that you're worried about a stupid ticket.

389
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,059
- There's not a problem.
- Ooh, 60 is average!

390
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,957
There's no child
being molested up here!

391
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:58,223
Oh, really? You know that?
You know that for a fact!

392
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,891
- I know that for a fact!
- No. No!

393
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,457
So you're thinking they put an
Amber Alert up for no reason.

394
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,130
They just want to see if people
will go chase around a car.

395
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,002
I think that most
of the Amber Alerts...

396
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,009
The police have such a
freakin' sense of humor!

397
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,171
- ...and those people...
- They just think it's hilarious for us to chase around a car...

398
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,271
- I'm not gonna yell over you.
- ...for no reason.

399
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,943
- I'm not gonna scream and yell over you.
- Well, just follow this car...

400
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:20,781
I'm gonna be quiet
and let you yell at me,

401
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,787
and when you're done yelling
I'll tell you what I think.

402
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,016
- Okay, fine. Go ahead.
- Obviously you don't want to listen to me.

403
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:26,888
Okay, what?
Oh, my gosh. Here.

404
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,793
- Just... stay back a little bit.
- All right, just calm down.

405
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,922
All right, look. If...

406
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,523
if anything, all...
most of those

407
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,002
are parents who are divorced

408
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,335
and they're having custody
battles with their kids,

409
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,170
and they keep the kids
for the weekend.

410
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,073
Maybe they kept them over
too long over the weekend.

411
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,543
They kept them Monday, Tuesday.

412
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,046
The mom gets pissed
the dad is spending more time...

413
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,310
And if that was the case, fine.

414
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:54,080
- That's what this is.
- But you don't know what the case is.

415
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,519
And, yes, it's weird
that it's tinted windows,

416
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,524
but everybod... there's a lot of
people that have tinted windows.

417
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,116
It's sunny here!

418
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,990
- He's braking here.
- All right, all right.

419
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:06,031
Just pay attention! We can't
just goof around about this.

420
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:07,224
All right, nunchuck me.

421
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,358
- Here you go, Jackie Chan.
- Nice!

422
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,369
- Yes!
- You guys!

423
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:13,234
Like that's really
gonna hurt any one.

424
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,136
Put those down.

425
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,903
- If he see us...
- I'm sorry.

426
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,444
This is not a joke.

427
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:22,242
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're right.

428
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,442
So, not get out
of the car then?

429
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,316
- Come on.
- Get your butt in here.

430
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,048
- Don't get out of the car!
- This is not a joke.

431
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,522
- You're right, I'm sorry.
- Nathan!

432
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,185
- That was stupid. I'm sorry.
- Just be...

433
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,920
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- ...an adult for once.

434
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:37,622
- Okay, I'm an adult.
- Okay, thank you.

435
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:40,893
- Now try not to get so close next time.
- I'm sorry.

436
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,331
Look at you!

437
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,528
You are so messed up right now.

438
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,594
- Well, let's just...
- Why are you so upset?

439
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,436
- You don't even know who this person is.
- Well, we don't know

440
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,408
who this person is,
but it could be any one.

441
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,105
- Yeah, but...
- If it was Caleb we would be right up there,

442
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,410
and we would wanna
bang on the door

443
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:58,541
and break a window
and pull the guy out.

444
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,108
If it were Caleb,
Caleb would kick his ass.

445
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,122
- What? High five.
- No one's touching my wiener.

446
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,158
- It's not a joke.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

447
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:07,886
It's a little kid that can't...

448
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,451
That can't kick a person's ass.

449
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,656
- You know, like, they're just...
- I know, okay.

450
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,222
- You're right, I'm sorry.
- ...ln there by themselves,

451
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:18,395
and we're the only ones that can
help them and tell them anything.

452
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:22,305
- So we need to follow them.
- Hey. Hey, Sam.

453
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:25,537
- It's just...
- Well, we just need to be on top of it.

454
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:27,476
- I'm sorry.
- Don't let him get away.

455
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:30,037
- Don't get upset. Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

456
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,516
Don't worry about me. Just make
sure that we get up there.

457
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,619
I got all this traffic coming.
I can't do anything.

458
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,248
Just keep your eye
on him, okay?

459
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,350
- Just keep looking.
- Caleb, can you see him?

460
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,157
- He just pulled in to the gas station.
- Don't lose him.

461
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,028
I'm not gonna kill us
over this, you know?

462
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,090
- I mean...
- You don't have to kill us.

463
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,601
What is he doing?
What is he doing?

464
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,638
Where'd he go? Is that him
right there getting gas?

465
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,503
Gas station...

466
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:58,566
All right, well,
I don't know what to do.

467
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,976
I mean, like, what are we
supposed to do?

468
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,071
Okay, let's just watch.

469
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:06,208
Should I park?
What... I mean...

470
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,479
Okay, there he is.

471
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:09,453
We just sit here,
and we'll just wait.

472
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,218
- What is he doing?
- We're just gonna sit here and wait for him

473
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,452
to start going in, and then we'll just...
- Okay.

474
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,290
...maybe keep
following him, I guess.

475
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,262
- 'Cause we're supposed to...
- Where is he?

476
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,730
Why is he just sitting there?

477
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,233
It's probably because
he knows we're watching him,

478
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,236
and he's watching us.

479
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,566
I know, I can't see anything.

480
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,097
He could be staring
right at us right now.

481
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,200
He probably is.

482
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:34,746
- There he is.
- If he looks over here,

483
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,713
Caleb, get the camera down.

484
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,148
Well, they could also use
it to help prosecute him.

485
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,083
He looks like
a regular dude, Sam.

486
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:42,620
He looks like a regular guy.
Look at him.

487
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,588
What do you expect
him to look like?

488
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,648
I mean, I don't know, he's kind
of, like, a good-looking dude.

489
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,386
He's kind of handsome.
I don't know.

490
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,519
I mean, I don't know what
child molesters look like.

491
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,461
- Well, you can't, you know...
- He looks...

492
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:54,431
- ...go on appearances alone.
- I'm not.

493
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,730
I'm saying he looks
fine, like he...

494
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,229
Why don't you go tackle him?

495
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,774
Oh, yeah.
Like I could take that guy.

496
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,036
- Take him down, Nate.
- Are you serious?

497
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,372
That guy would kick my ass.

498
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:10,211
Even if he isn't,
you know, like, whatever,

499
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,749
even if he's
completely innocent,

500
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,148
he could still kick my ass.

501
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,776
He's going.
He's leaving.

502
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,413
Yeah, well, just... we'll just
wait for him to come back.

503
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:21,425
Sam, what are you doing? Sam, you get
your ass back in this car right now!

504
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:25,793
Shit. Sam. Sam. Sam.
Come back here!

505
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:30,426
Oh, my god, what the hell
is wrong with her?

506
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,301
What is she doing?
What is she doing?!

507
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:41,244
Oh, she's calling me.
She's calling me.

508
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,248
Sam...

509
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:48,446
Sam, you come back
here right now. I'm get...

510
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,579
I'm gonna freaking kill you.

511
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,317
I can't see anything.
It's too dark.

512
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,189
Listen, Sam, if he comes
back, I'll tell you.

513
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,750
Okay, I'll tell you
if he comes back.

514
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,060
- Just listen!
- Keep a lookout for me.

515
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:03,329
I can't see anything
in this stupid car.

516
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:06,166
Wait, I see like,
some paper work.

517
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,705
The window!

518
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,469
The window's cracked
a little. I can see in.

519
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,567
- He's not coming yet?
- No, he's not!

520
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,306
Just come back here!

521
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,474
- Oh, my goodness.
- What, what, what?

522
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,315
Hey, little girl.
Hey, can you hear me?

523
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:22,854
- Wake up!
- Oh, my god.

524
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:27,187
Can you hear me?
Are you okay?

525
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,821
Can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?

526
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,831
Little girl, wake up!
I can't get her.

527
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,697
Sam, there's
a little girl in the car?

528
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:38,236
There's a little girl
in the car?

529
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,736
Should I break the window
or something?

530
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,171
No, don't break the...
it's probably his daughter!

531
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,436
It's probably
his daughter, Sam!

532
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,104
What if it's not?
What if it's not?

533
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,273
Sam, there's nothing
we can do, okay?

534
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,748
You just need
to come back here.

535
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:54,115
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

536
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,313
He's coming out.
- Sam, he's coming back! He's coming back!

537
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,788
- Tell her to come back.
- Get out of there! Get out of there!

538
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,656
- It's him?
- Yes. Just walk. Just walk.

539
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,160
- Did he see me?
- No. No, he didn't see you. Just walk.

540
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,389
Is he looking at me?
What's he doing?

541
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,398
He's just... he's...
he didn't see you.

542
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,592
You're fine.
Just walk.

543
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,534
Just don't run.
He did not see you.

544
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,571
You're fine.
Just walk over to the car.

545
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:15,834
Everything is fine.

546
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:19,901
- Does he see me?
- Nope. No, he's not looking. No, he's not looking.

547
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,377
- He didn't see you.
- Oh, my gosh, there's a little girl in the backseat.

548
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,421
That was so stupid!
I cannot believe you did that!

549
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:31,149
There was a little girl
in the backseat.

550
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,850
Okay, so give me the
camera. I put my mic...

551
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,792
- I put my mic in the backseat.
- What? Why did you do that?

552
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,294
Because if we have a headset,

553
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,624
we can put the headset
in the camera

554
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,688
and listen to what's
going on in there.

555
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,792
Well, yeah, but what about...
the little girl's probably his daughter!

556
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,359
We'll know!
We'll be able to tell!

557
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:47,405
All right, all right,
all right, let me...

558
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:49,913
- Do we have a headset?
- I don't... no, I don't have a... no!

559
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,704
- He's leaving!
- Where's your...

560
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,378
We have to follow him.
We have to save...

561
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,573
All right, hang on.
Here, use my auxiliary cable.

562
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,672
- Here, hook it into the back.
- ...receiving.

563
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,431
- We should be able to hear it on the car speakers.
- ...plugged in.

564
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,612
It's on...

565
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,947
It's on the...
it's on the wrong thing.

566
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:08,720
Here... here,
push that.

567
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,422
God, I hope this works.

568
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,226
How's that?

569
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,291
- No, that's something.
- Don't get too close to him.

570
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,667
And, Caleb, get down. If we're
close, we don't want him to see us.

571
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,569
We're not gonna get too close.
What is that?

572
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:32,579
- Is that in his car?
- Uh, yeah, I think it is.

573
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:35,449
- Hi, I...
- You totally did it.

574
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:38,581
- It works.
- That's totally in his car.

575
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:41,592
Oh, my god. I cannot
believe you did this.

576
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,355
This is so crazy.

577
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,226
You know how many laws
we're breaking right now?

578
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,357
Who cares about laws?

579
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,367
You're freakin'

580
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,800
MacGyver here.

581
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,498
That's 7028.

582
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:57,474
What'd he say?

583
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,670
I don't know, 7028?

584
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,511
Okay...
that's what he said.

585
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:07,712
- That was his address.
- Thank you.

586
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,653
7028.

587
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,492
Well, um, I'm just
looking at my bill,

588
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:18,689
and there's this charge for..

589
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:22,700
- Where's the little girl?
- Yeah, she's sleeping...

590
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,963
...$95, and I don't
text that much,

591
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:28,268
So I'm wondering...

592
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,433
He's talking
to his phone provider!

593
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:34,536
He's talking about his bill
to his phone provider!

594
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,810
- Why is that so funny?
- Because!

595
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,976
I'm not...

596
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:41,519
Why is that funny?

597
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,782
I just think it's funny
because, you know...

598
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:45,323
- I don't text.
- Listen to him!

599
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,982
Listen to him!
He sounds so casual.

600
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,425
He's talking about his bill.
It's not like he's...

601
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:51,428
Don't you think if he
kidnapped a little girl

602
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:54,021
he wouldn't be talking to his
phone provider about his bill?

603
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,431
Just because he's talking
to his phone provider...

604
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,298
- You need to stay close...
- I'm trying.

605
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,634
I'm going as fast
as I can here.

606
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,072
- I mean...
- Just because he's talking to his phone provider,

607
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,938
I mean, molesters have phones.

608
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,035
- Yeah, but, I mean...
- You're going out of the max range.

609
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,704
- You can't go that far.
- Did we lose him?

610
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,941
- We gotta get closer.
- Aw, shit reception!

611
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:13,484
Oh, there he is,
oh, there he is.

612
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,713
- Yes, Sandhill.
- Stay up with him.

613
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,982
Sandhill!

614
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,921
That could be,
like, his password

615
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,323
or the name of something.

616
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:23,088
- Could be nothing.
- Or his address.

617
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:25,595
- Sandhill...
- Or a city? I don't know.

618
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,325
Hey, I did that.

619
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,765
- Just be quiet a minute.
- I don't know, like...

620
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,065
Sandhill Apartments
or Sandhill Retirement Home.

621
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:33,900
You should be up close to him.

622
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,440
I don't have time for this.
I need to, uh...

623
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:39,477
Is it his last name,
Mr. Sandhill?

624
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,637
- Could be.
- I mean, I don't know.

625
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:45,342
- Could be.
- Shh, just listen!

626
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,578
My ex-wife doesn't have a line
to my phone, does she?

627
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,076
My ex-wife doesn't
have a line to my phone.

628
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,621
- Okay...
- He has an ex-wife.

629
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,657
If he has an ex-wife,
why did she divorce him?

630
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:54,658
Well, she's obviously
still alive.

631
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:56,557
- You know I don't text!
- Maybe he's not a murderer.

632
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,619
It's not the...
it's not the money.

633
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,961
Don't you think if he was gonna
kill somebody, it'd be his ex-wife?

634
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,364
Maybe he did kill her.

635
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:03,901
Oh, that's classic.

636
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,767
Yeah, your supervisor
can call me back

637
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:11,002
at his... or her...
earliest convenience.

638
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:21,013
The one that I called from.
This phone.

639
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,917
- Yes, it's 602...
- Get his phone number!

640
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:23,488
602...

641
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:33,796
No, you've done
a great job. Thanks.

642
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:37,801
Uh...

643
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,139
That's it.
That's the number.

644
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,687
All right, great!
Give me the number.

645
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,733
I'll give him a call right now.

646
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:48,075
- I'll call him right now...
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna call him? No!

647
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,137
- I'm gonna get involved!
- We can give it to the police.

648
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,816
The police will know...
they can track it

649
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,512
and find out exactly who he is.

650
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:56,019
Give me the number. I'll call
him and be like, "Hey! ".

651
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:58,079
- Shut up!
- "Are you a child molester?"

652
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,784
Now, that would put
the kid in danger.

653
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,986
Oh, shit, okay, here we go.

654
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,426
All right.

655
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,088
Don't get too close to him.

656
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:07,825
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

657
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,958
I'm not getting too close.

658
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:12,026
Put your camera down.

659
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:14,572
What road are we on?

660
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,937
- I have no idea.
- Okay, he's pulling over.

661
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:19,443
- Yeah, well, good!
- He's pulling over.

662
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,672
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Sam!

663
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:25,114
Whoa... Sam!
Don't ever grab the...

664
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:27,549
Why isn't he getting out? Why
isn't he coming over yet?

665
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,849
He's gonna come over here and kick
my ass, that's what he's gonna do!

666
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,548
He's gonna come over here...
he might have a gun!

667
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:32,749
He might have a bat,
a crowbar...

668
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:33,950
Do we have a bat?
Do we have something

669
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,152
that we can protect
ourselves...

670
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,558
No, we don't have any weapons!

671
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:37,989
There's three of us
and one of him.

672
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,657
My nunchucks,
that's what we have.

673
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:42,529
Okay? Maybe we could nunchuck
him with the padded nunchucks.

674
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,626
- Oh, my gosh.
- What? Oh, god.

675
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,864
- He's getting out.
- I'm driving. I'm getting out of here.

676
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,929
Caleb, get down. Give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

677
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,702
- This is a bad idea.
- You are just not listening.

678
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:53,574
Hide the camera, for God's sakes!
I can still see it.

679
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,510
- I'm hiding it.
- This guy could kill us!

680
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,605
- How about right there?
- Is he looking at me?

681
00:28:57,682 --> 00:28:59,240
Oh, my gosh, he's coming up!
He's coming up!

682
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:00,750
- Lock the door!
- All right, all right.

683
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:02,116
- What is he gonna say?
- I don't know.

684
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,848
Maybe we should just...
I'm just gonna drive.

685
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,480
- No! No!
- Yeah, get out of here!

686
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:06,854
What am I supposed
to say to him?

687
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,722
We can't just leave
the little girl here.

688
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:10,274
What am I supposed
to say to him, Sam?

689
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,490
I don't know.
Okay, roll the window down.

690
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:13,997
Do not roll down the window!

691
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,125
- Roll it down.
- I don't want to roll it down.

692
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,034
- Hi.
- Oh, shit.

693
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,664
- Problem? Having some car problems?
- Hey!

694
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,210
- Oh, uh, are you okay?
- No, we're not having car problems.

695
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:28,712
Is your car? Are you having
problems with your car?

696
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,213
- No, we saw... we saw...
- Pulled off,

697
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,002
and thought you maybe
you had some problems,

698
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,847
so we pulled off
to see if you were okay.

699
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,784
You been following me to find
out if my car is running okay?

700
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:37,651
- Yeah...
- No! No!

701
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,656
Your car looks like
my buddy's car, actually.

702
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,157
No, we are following
you because...

703
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:43,285
I-I know why you're
following me, okay?

704
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,919
I-I think it's
that Amber Alert.

705
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,588
- Yeah!
- Okay.

706
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,826
- Uh...
- And you have a little girl in your car.

707
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,130
- Yes, I do.
- Uh, is she okay?

708
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,228
- Yes, that's my daughter.
- And we're gonna call the police right now.

709
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,738
I've already talked
to the police. It's fine.

710
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:56,205
And you have
to stay right here.

711
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:57,832
No, I've talked to the
police. That's fine.

712
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,536
Have them come here,
I'll talk to them again.

713
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,545
Believe me, it shocked
the hell out of me.

714
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:03,638
I saw my license plate
on the Amber Alert.

715
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:07,173
So I'm actually kind of surprised
that you were paying attention,

716
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:10,312
and now we're here.
So, I just wanted to clarify

717
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:13,016
and clear the air and come
talk to you personally.

718
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,649
It's my daughter.

719
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,694
I'm trying to get her
back to my ex-wife.

720
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:19,696
I'm about ten miles away,
and I'm a day late.

721
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,698
Okay, well, if someone
is on the Amber Alert

722
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:22,966
we can't really trust, like...

723
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,162
- Well, I know...
- Well...

724
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,261
You could be a big fat liar
for all we know.

725
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:28,806
Well, Sam, I mean, it's kind of what
I've been saying the whole time.

726
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:30,102
I mean, I-I...

727
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,302
this kind of thing
happens all the time...

728
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:34,777
- No, yeah.
- ...with custody battles or whatever.

729
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,245
This is exactly
what I've been saying!

730
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,975
- Well, I...
- I know I sound like a...

731
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,574
it's a typical story.
I got a crazy ex-wife.

732
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:42,119
I never get to see my child,

733
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,348
and I finally got her
for a weekend

734
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:45,855
and I kept her a little long.

735
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,289
- Yeah.
- That's the story.

736
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,156
- And I am a day late.
- Man...

737
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,024
Talk to the cops.
I've worked it all out.

738
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:52,859
You can call them.
I just got off the phone.

739
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,762
I've got the number.
The phone is in my car.

740
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,801
We can go talk to them
together, if you'd like.

741
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:58,301
- Okay, yes. Yes.
- No, no, no. No, Sam!

742
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,361
- We want to call the police.
- No, Sam! Hey, hey!

743
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,872
- We need to make sure it's okay.
- Sam, we don't need to do that.

744
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,102
- We've done enough.
- Or, better yet, my daughter's in the car.

745
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:06,371
We can wake her up
and talk to her.

746
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:07,968
- Yes!
- No, don't worry about that.

747
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:09,877
- Would you like to do that?
- Let's wake her up!

748
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,313
- Let's go.
- No, no, no, don't worry about it.

749
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,078
- Yes!
- We have bothered you enough.

750
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:15,016
We've been following you,
and I'm really embarrassed.

751
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:17,782
And to tell you the truth, I
just feel like a freaking idiot!

752
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,256
- No, no, no, don't feel like an idiot.
- I feel so stupid!

753
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:22,259
I think it's wonderful.
I think it's amazing

754
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,659
that you guys were actually
paying attention and...

755
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:25,889
That's real nice that you...

756
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,397
thanks for being
so cool about it.

757
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:30,229
Well, well, cool? No! No, you
were on the Amber Alert.

758
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,167
- I know.
- He just... Sam!

759
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,296
- Believe me, I was shocked my self.
- We need to call the police.

760
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:37,671
He just explained that
it's probably... I mean...

761
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:39,266
- Okay, well...
- ...his ex-wife.

762
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,778
Obviously you're not good
with this, you're not cool,

763
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,404
- So what do I need to do?
- No, I'm not cool, because...

764
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,914
- What do I need to do?
- Who knows?

765
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:46,177
I just...
I don't trust...

766
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,809
I don't know you,
I don't trust you.

767
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,911
I just want to make sure
the little girl is okay.

768
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,751
- Sam...
- Do you want to come to my ex-wife's house?

769
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,188
- I'm ten miles away.
- Listen, listen.

770
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,953
Just hang on
one second. Sam.

771
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:57,358
I think we...
this is embarrassing.

772
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,896
This is embarrassing,

773
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:01,194
and he's obviously
just a regular dude,

774
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:04,064
- And this is stupid.
- Are you sure? Are you sure?

775
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,055
- This is stupid!
- I'll do whatever you need.

776
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,971
You can call the cops,
you can look at my ID..

777
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,064
- We appreciate it, man.
- ...talk to my daughter, whatever you need.

778
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,336
We really appreciate it, man,
for you being so nice.

779
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,401
I think it's amazing
you guys were doing this.

780
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,037
I thought you'd be
so pissed off

781
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,105
'cause we've been
following you or whatever.

782
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,276
No, I was a little concerned,
but I kinda figured it out.

783
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,081
When did you...
when did you notice us.

784
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:24,314
I thought I was being
pretty stealthy, actually.

785
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:25,947
I thought I was
hiding pretty good.

786
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,787
You've been watching
too many movies.

787
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:28,985
Okay...

788
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,186
Okay, yeah, I guess so.

789
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,923
Okay, well, are we okay?

790
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,123
All right...

791
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:36,167
- Are you sure?
- Sam, it's fine.

792
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,702
He's... it's fine, dude.
It's fine, dude.

793
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,965
Thank you. Thank you for
being so cool about this.

794
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,769
I'm sorry for all the...
I feel stupid about it.

795
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:44,968
I feel really stupid.

796
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,271
You've got my license plate.

797
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:47,936
- Turn me in.
- Yes, definitely.

798
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,072
Okay, good-bye!
Have a good...

799
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:51,445
have a good night!

800
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:55,475
So, wasted an entire day
doing this stupid shit.

801
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:57,987
Let's just cut
our losses and go.

802
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,890
We lost a microphone.
Let's just go, okay?

803
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,258
Obviously he's a regular guy.

804
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,127
He seems like
a regular, nice guy

805
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,928
who is having serious problems
with his ex-wife.

806
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,026
We know he had
an ex-wife. I mean...

807
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,503
Oh, he's pissed.
I mean...

808
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:17,370
That does not seem
like the same guy...

809
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,967
- We're going home.
- See? Something shady.

810
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:22,013
Naw, he seems...
he's just pissed off about...

811
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,308
he's just pissed off at us!

812
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,178
Get up!

813
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,310
Is that my daddy?

814
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:31,412
I told you, you're not
seeing your daddy again.

815
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,457
I'm scared.

816
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:34,924
I don't care!

817
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,791
Just shut up!

818
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,762
- Nate! Nate!
- Oh, my god.

819
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:40,957
Oh, my gosh!

820
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,272
I know, I know, I know, I know.

821
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,359
Oh, my gosh!
We let him go!

822
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,960
I know!
I'm sorry.

823
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,130
Okay, okay, turn around.
I'm calling the police.

824
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,902
- I'm calling the police.
- Sam, we're not gonna turn around!

825
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:53,170
He went that way!
I saw him go that way!

826
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,405
- Oh, my...
- We have to turn around, the next turn!

827
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,004
Look, all right!
All right!

828
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:59,346
I'm sorry,
but I still don't think

829
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,248
we need to keep
following him, though!

830
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,911
Oh, my gosh!
Are you kidding me?

831
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,352
You let him get away!

832
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,322
You let a little girl
who's gonna be killed...!

833
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:09,519
No, Sam, there's...
what are we supposed to do?

834
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:11,255
What are we supposed to do?

835
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,455
He's obviously an...

836
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,430
Hello? Hello, yes!

837
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:16,364
We were following
an Amber Alert car.

838
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,061
Tell the police to hurry up!

839
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,570
He pulled over, we pulled
over to talk to him.

840
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,265
We thought
he was fine! He...

841
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,399
- We heard the car...
- Sam, quit screaming.

842
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,239
Just talk to the lady.

843
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,311
We heard him, and he was
saying that he was gonna...

844
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:30,281
it wasn't his dad!
It wasn't her dad!

845
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:34,409
We need... well... well,
we have a microphone...

846
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:36,545
we put a microphone in the car.

847
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:39,089
I know! We wouldn't have
been following them

848
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:42,285
and talk to him if
you guys would show up!

849
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,351
There's no police!
We haven't seen any police yet!

850
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,270
We have to turn around!
We have to follow them!

851
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,958
Sam, just talk to the lady.

852
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,897
We are gonna follow them!
We are gonna follow them!

853
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,265
This dude could hurt us
if we follow him.

854
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:54,362
We're on 347.
They're going south.

855
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,066
We saw.
He's going south.

856
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,109
Yes, we are gonna follow them!

857
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,838
- No.
- Well, if there were police here we wouldn't have to!

858
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:02,345
- Sam, we can't follow him.
- Yeah!

859
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,848
Sam, we... we...
if we follow him...

860
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,043
Okay, turn around! Now,
turn around and go back!

861
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,279
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Did you hang up on her?

862
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,549
- You let him go!
- I know...

863
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:13,113
- You let him go!
- Because, Sam...

864
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,522
- You talked me into it!
- Sam...

865
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:16,924
- You talked me into leaving!
- I know, because...

866
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,035
- You talked me into leaving the little girl!
- Sam!

867
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,583
- Right here!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

868
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,088
- Turn the car around!
- Sam! Sam!

869
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,687
- We cannot leave her!
- Sam! Sam! Sam!

870
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,191
- We have to!
- Sam, listen.

871
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,135
- We have to follow them!
- I'm gonna turn...

872
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,901
- We have to follow them!
- Sam, I'm gonna turn around, okay?

873
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:31,601
- Okay, we have to hurry!
- Okay, just stop.

874
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:33,541
Just listen to me
for a second! Just listen!

875
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,545
He's gone already.

876
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,878
I know, we lost reception, obviously,
because we're too far away!

877
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,180
We have to hurry!
Move, car!

878
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,083
That is not fair for you
to put that on me!

879
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:45,088
- Go around! Go around!
- Do not put that on me.

880
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:46,487
Like I... like it's
all my fault!

881
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:49,026
It's my fault too!
It's my fault too!

882
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,560
I should've followed my gut.

883
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:52,619
I should've said,
"Shut up! Shut up!"

884
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,562
And we need to get in that car!

885
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:56,099
That's what I should've done.

886
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,367
I should've gone with my gut!

887
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,131
- No!
- And, no, I don't!

888
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:03,538
I just listen to you and I
don't know what I was thinking!

889
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,609
I'm going over...
I'm pushing 100, Sam!

890
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:08,145
- I'm pushing 100 miles an hour.
- Come on, come on, come on.

891
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:09,680
We are gonna catch him, okay?

892
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,181
We're gonna catch up to him,
we're gonna find him.

893
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,581
- I...
- Can you see him?

894
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,243
I can't tell.
I don't even think...

895
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,117
that looks like
a Mercedes to me.

896
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,122
I don't think that's him, Sam.

897
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,124
- No, that's him.
- Maybe I can zoom in.

898
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,092
- Are you sure?
- Yes, that is him.

899
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,526
Get up there.
Get up there closer.

900
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:25,927
All right.
All right!

901
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:27,294
- All right.
- Oh, shit, that is him.

902
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,162
That is him, you're right.

903
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:31,395
- I don't want to...
- You have to stay up there with him!

904
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:33,596
What are we supposed
to do, ram him off the road?

905
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,105
Sam, if he sees our car he might
do something to the little girl.

906
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,074
He's already gonna do
something to the little girl!

907
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,076
Yeah, but he knows
what our car looks like!

908
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:41,270
Just stay so we can see him.

909
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,211
Sam! Sam!
There's a police car!

910
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,545
- Oh, my gosh.
- There's a police car right behind us!

911
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,585
Oh, my gosh! Yay!

912
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,983
Freakin' finally.

913
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,454
You're going down, buddy!

914
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:55,686
- You see him!
- Nail his ass!

915
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,284
Oh, man, this is
gonna be great.

916
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,590
Caleb, keep filming it, man.

917
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,096
I'm getting it.
I'm filming.

918
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:01,495
Make sure we get all of this.

919
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:04,364
Whoo!
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

920
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,426
There he is!

921
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:08,438
- Pull over.
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

922
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,565
Go! You gotta get him!
He's the Amber Alert car!

923
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:12,974
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

924
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:15,376
That's the car!!!

925
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,107
That's from the Amber Alert!

926
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,376
That's the Amber Alert car
right there!

927
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,974
Is this guy an idiot!

928
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,576
Look at the license plate!

929
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:23,985
Look at the license plate!

930
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,216
Sam! Sam, Sam, he wants
me to pull over.

931
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,316
- No, because...
- No, no, no, no!

932
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:30,327
He'll figure it out
eventually. Keep going!

933
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,760
No, no, no,
he's pulling me over!

934
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,059
No, go out in the left lane.
Go in the left lane!

935
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:35,394
Nate, just keep going!

936
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:36,990
I can't!
It's a police officer!

937
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:38,535
No, we can't let him
get away again!

938
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:41,367
- I'm pulling off. I have to!
- No! No, no, no, no!

939
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,679
All right, just...
just relax...

940
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,298
Oh, my gosh.
No, no, no, no, no!

941
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,502
Just stay in the car
and we'll explain it to him!

942
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:49,699
- Just stay in the car and we'll explain it to him!
- No, I have to tell him!

943
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,682
No! Ugh!

944
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,410
What should we do?
Should we get out?

945
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,748
All right. Sam!

946
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,291
No!

947
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:09,063
What part of "pull over"
don't you guys understand?

948
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,691
What the hell is going on?

949
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:14,204
- Keep going!
- ...Amber Alert car.

950
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,173
- What car?
- It's a gray Honda...

951
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,140
...Amber Alert.
When did you guys see it?

952
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:23,510
Like, an hour and a half ago.

953
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,242
I'm telling you,
it's right there!

954
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,783
We've been following
him for hours.

955
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,375
- All right, stay there.
- Go get him!

956
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,648
There's a little girl
at stake right now!

957
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,053
Relax.
Stay right there.

958
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:35,251
Just relax. Sam,
he is on our side.

959
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:38,591
I think that, you know,
he's gonna help us out.

960
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,722
He's long gone by now.

961
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,698
Okay, he's just gonna be gone.

962
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,065
No, he's... no, he's not.
No, he's not, Sam!

963
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,195
He's calling in right now.
He's gonna check it,

964
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,231
and do you think that...
do you think that that...

965
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:52,208
the Honda can outrun this, the police car?
- Hurry, hurry.

966
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:56,508
He's gonna catch up to him, and
everything's gonna be fine, okay?

967
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,208
I guess we just need to...

968
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,512
he's on our side!

969
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,553
You said gray Honda, right?

970
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,087
- Gray Honda, yes.
- All right.

971
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,816
They confirmed
there is the Amber Alert.

972
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,687
- I'll go track him down.
- Okay, great!

973
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,659
You guys, I need you to go back
to the sheriff's office,

974
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,285
- Go back to the station...
- Okay.

975
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,282
- Make sure you find the deputies there.
- Okay.

976
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:15,288
They're gonna want to take your
statements and see that video.

977
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,856
- Okay.
- All right?

978
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:18,526
We'll definitely show them
the video and everything.

979
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,332
Go ahead and shut it off.

980
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,100
You can't videotape while we're
out here on the highway.

981
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:23,333
Shut it off.
Come on.

982
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:25,205
All right, well,
we should get in the car.

983
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:26,800
We should go.
We should keep looking.

984
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,438
What do you mean, get in the
car and go and keep looking?

985
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:32,449
Well, this, you know, we should
keep looking till they find her.

986
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,417
- What, no! No!
- Right?

987
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:36,544
That's what we just
talked to him about.

988
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:39,283
We actually were face to face
with a real police officer,

989
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:41,120
- And they're taking care of it.
- I know.

990
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:42,784
- No, I know, it's great, but we...
- Don't you...

991
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,260
The more eyes out there
looking for her, the better.

992
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,627
- All right...
- You know how long it took us to find him?

993
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,190
- And then we want to make sure.
- I was just kinda...

994
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:51,748
Stop complaining
with me and let's go.

995
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:53,794
Can we at least stop
and get something to eat?

996
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,429
No!

997
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:57,633
...that she's all right.
That's when I'll be happy.

998
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,769
- So, go right at this light.
- Okay, got it.

999
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:02,904
Okay, so take a right
at this street.

1000
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,141
Should we talk
to these people, or...?

1001
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:06,342
No, those are just kids.

1002
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:09,385
What's this car up here?

1003
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,649
It looks like a gray
Honda or something.

1004
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:15,819
This all feels really,
like, just pointless to me.

1005
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,758
Don't you think
this feels kinda like...

1006
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,694
Well, it's pointless
unless we find her.

1007
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,756
I mean... ah.

1008
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,236
- This just seems like...
- It only takes one street,

1009
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,906
one car that we happen
to see, you know?

1010
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,737
I mean, I know
it's a long shot, but...

1011
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:31,934
It is! It...

1012
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:33,442
...but why not take
the long shot?

1013
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,739
It's a long shot.

1014
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,404
'Cause it's worth it.
Go left here.

1015
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:38,346
I'm just trying
to be realistic, Samantha.

1016
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:41,579
It's definitely, like,
needle-in-a-hay stack situation.

1017
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,176
Officer Murray
gave me this number,

1018
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:44,448
and I just wanted
to call and see

1019
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:45,887
if there was any word
about the Amber Alert.

1020
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:47,481
They're not gonna
know anything yet.

1021
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:49,822
Yeah, they would know
if they found her.

1022
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:51,657
Blood sugar is really low,
and I just...

1023
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,822
my hands are shaking.
I needs something to eat.

1024
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:55,263
Don't be such a baby.

1025
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,891
I'm not being a baby!

1026
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,459
I'm just saying, we haven't
eaten anything all day.

1027
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:01,437
I'm starving.
It's been a crazy day today.

1028
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:04,236
Can we at least get something to eat?
That's all I'm saying.

1029
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:05,741
All right, like,
20 more minutes.

1030
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,210
20 minutes?! Why are
you, like, so gung-ho?

1031
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:10,213
Like, we have...
there's a police officer...

1032
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,805
Hello? There's
a little girl missing!

1033
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,783
I know!
You keep saying that.

1034
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:15,614
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

1035
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,745
I'm driving around,
but there's nothing we can do!

1036
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:18,948
It's gone!
They're gone!

1037
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,923
Well, we just have
to keep looking.

1038
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:23,688
She's probably... I'm saying
she's probably already dead!

1039
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:25,558
Don't say that!

1040
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,495
If we had tried
to attack him back there,

1041
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,624
he probably would've
killed us, okay?

1042
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,726
For all we know.
I don't know.

1043
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,567
But think about her.

1044
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,368
- Think? I am think...
- Think about her.

1045
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,908
I don't give a shit
about her! How about that?

1046
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:40,910
I don't give a shit
about that little girl!

1047
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,502
I don't care about her!

1048
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,877
Why would you say that?

1049
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,279
I don't care!

1050
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:46,475
What is wrong with you?

1051
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,314
I don't care about her!

1052
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:51,844
I want... I want us
to be safe.

1053
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:54,517
- I am not a police officer!
- She needs help!

1054
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:57,493
She is alone in the car.
She has nobody!

1055
00:41:57,562 --> 00:42:00,360
There's three of us.
We have each other.

1056
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,626
She has no one!

1057
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,501
No one except that
slimy, disgusting freak!

1058
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:11,565
Just how can you
not care about her?

1059
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:12,904
I do, I care.

1060
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:15,275
What if it was Caleb?
What if it was me?

1061
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,280
What if I was in that car?

1062
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:18,940
- Sam...
- What if he had me in there?

1063
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:22,281
I love you more than anything
in the whole world, Sam.

1064
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:23,911
If it were you,
it would be different.

1065
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,286
If it were you, it would
be totally different.

1066
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:40,564
What are you doing?

1067
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,736
What are we doing?

1068
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,474
I'm hungry.

1069
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,341
Do you want me to keep filming?

1070
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:30,883
Yeah, yeah. We need
to keep filming.

1071
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:34,447
I mean, that's our one...

1072
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:38,655
last chance, our
one last hope of...

1073
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:39,923
him still being out there.

1074
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:42,022
We could still hear him.

1075
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:47,434
The car's off.
Dang it.

1076
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:50,099
Um... do we have...

1077
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:52,642
that headset around
here somewhere?

1078
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:07,420
All right, put these in.

1079
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:08,924
Keep the camera on.

1080
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:10,460
Let's keep listening.

1081
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,018
I'll listen.

1082
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:15,463
Hopefully we'll hear something.

1083
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:23,769
I just wanted to talk
to Officer Murray.

1084
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,866
Is there any news at all?

1085
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:34,109
All right, is there
anything that we can do?

1086
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:35,948
He got called away.
They don't even...

1087
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,647
I can't even talk
to him for an hour,

1088
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:39,690
but obviously
they haven't found anything.

1089
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:40,951
They don't know anything.

1090
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:42,959
Nobody's looking for her.

1091
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,199
- No, no, we need to hear.
- Shut it off.

1092
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,033
Just in case we...
in case he drives by

1093
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,663
or he lives around here,
we'll be able to hear him.

1094
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,730
We're gonna keep filming.

1095
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,045
What are you doing?

1096
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,091
Sandhill. Maybe
it's his address.

1097
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:15,489
I'm gonna do a search.

1098
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,151
What are you
talking about, Sandhill?

1099
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:19,196
He said "Sandhill"
on the phone.

1100
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,663
We didn't know why,
but I'm just gonna check

1101
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,597
and see if there's
a street around here.

1102
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,134
Sandhill.

1103
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,900
Sam, I-I...

1104
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:34,067
I don't know how to deal
with this situation,

1105
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:38,582
and I've handled it
badly, and I screwed up,

1106
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:43,109
and I just feel like
I need to say I'm sorry,

1107
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,849
that I feel like our
friendship is more important.

1108
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:50,155
There's a Sandhill Road.
There's a Sandhill Road.

1109
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:02,671
Two and a half minutes
to get there.

1110
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,207
We have to go.

1111
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,970
We have to at least
check it out.

1112
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:09,605
We have to see, I mean...

1113
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,240
if it's where he lives.

1114
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:14,546
He... that's where
he would take her.

1115
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,055
- Right here.
- ...like a thing that just goes on and on.

1116
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:23,025
- Right here.
- Okay, right here. I got it.

1117
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:25,085
I'm not trying to be...

1118
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,562
like, I'll stay up
with you all night,

1119
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,599
you know, if I have to,
but at the same time...

1120
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,259
- Take a left.
- ...there has to be a point

1121
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,599
where you have
to call it quits.

1122
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:35,002
You know what I mean?

1123
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:38,735
For all we know,
a lot of time has gone by.

1124
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:41,903
We could take the footage
to the cops.

1125
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:44,539
We'll tell them Sandhill Road.

1126
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,583
We'll give them
that information,

1127
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,016
and that...
and that'll be it, right?

1128
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,576
Yeah, I...

1129
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:51,916
That'll be it, right, Sam?

1130
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:53,957
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That'll be it.

1131
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,150
Okay, so take a right here.

1132
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,557
This should be it.

1133
00:46:56,627 --> 00:46:57,753
Right here.

1134
00:46:57,828 --> 00:46:58,954
Mm-hmm. Sandhill.

1135
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,656
That's it.
Sandhill Road. Yep.

1136
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,596
- All right.
- All right.

1137
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:03,928
We're here.

1138
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,936
Just go super slow.

1139
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:09,632
We just gotta listen.

1140
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,154
I don't hear anything.

1141
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:27,690
Maybe stay closer
to the right-hand...

1142
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:29,623
- Okay. All right.
- ...of the way, here.

1143
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:31,183
All right, and then all right.

1144
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,336
Oh, look, I think
this is it, Sam.

1145
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,893
This is the whole street.

1146
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,836
Okay, well, turn around,
and we'll stay

1147
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,272
on the other side
on the way back.

1148
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:48,004
Not much to it,
and, uh, I didn't hear anything.

1149
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:50,103
Now, is there
another Sandhill Road?

1150
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:51,648
Is there somewhere else?

1151
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:52,977
I mean, there has...
is this it?

1152
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,176
No. This is it.

1153
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,116
All right. I mean...

1154
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:58,212
Okay, just sitting...

1155
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,382
This is it.

1156
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:04,216
Okay, keep going slow.

1157
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,092
I'm going as slow as I can.

1158
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,188
I mean, there's only...
one, two, three...

1159
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,994
like, ten houses.

1160
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:11,830
We could knock on each door

1161
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:13,802
and find out exactly
who lives in them...

1162
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,669
Sam, no.
We're not doing that.

1163
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,866
...and what
is going on.

1164
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:19,341
We're not doing that.

1165
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,640
What if you knocked
on his door?

1166
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,339
What if you knocked
on the guy's door?

1167
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:24,881
Then at least we'd find him

1168
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,814
and we'd at least
know where he is.

1169
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:29,944
That'd be the last door you
knocked on in your life, okay?

1170
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,250
Okay, turn around.
Do a U-turn.

1171
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,723
I mean, even if we knocked
on his neighbor's doors,

1172
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,918
there... I mean...

1173
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,688
Maybe they would
recognize his car.

1174
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:38,961
If we went and said, you know,

1175
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,657
"Have you seen
this car in the area?"

1176
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:42,699
Well, look for his car!
I don't even see it.

1177
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,233
I don't see his car.

1178
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,292
Well, there's garages.

1179
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,668
I don't... I mean,
yeah, I guess

1180
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:50,934
he parked it
in the garage, I don't know.

1181
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:54,203
Is this turned up?

1182
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:55,768
Yeah, it's turned up.

1183
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:59,714
I mean, they could
be quiet right now...

1184
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,717
I don't know.

1185
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:05,078
You think that
the microphone would give off

1186
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:07,851
some kind of signal
or interference or something.

1187
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:10,257
Maybe you'd hear something.

1188
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:13,194
I don't hear anything.

1189
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:18,401
All right.
All right.

1190
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:22,869
I think that...

1191
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,932
I think that might be it, Sam.

1192
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,001
I don't...

1193
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:30,012
if the microphone were here,

1194
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,208
we'd be able
to pick it up, you know?

1195
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:34,979
- So...
- I know.

1196
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:38,783
I haven't heard anything,
so I think that...

1197
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:42,087
we should just...
call it quits, okay?

1198
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:47,293
I mean, there's
nothing else we can do.

1199
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,161
Yeah.

1200
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,201
We gotta get
Caleb back home, too.

1201
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:53,429
I mean, like, this isn't
fair to your bro.

1202
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:56,962
I was just hoping
that we'd be able

1203
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,474
to find something, you know?

1204
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,203
I know. I know.
I did, too.

1205
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:01,801
I know.
I understand.

1206
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:03,779
I just don't know
what else to do.

1207
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:06,441
Sam, there's nothing more
you could've done.

1208
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,917
Sam, you've done everything.

1209
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:10,226
You've gone above and beyond

1210
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,482
what any normal person
would've done.

1211
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:15,116
You've done more than what
any one else would've done.

1212
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:17,524
But it's sad that it's
obviously not enough.

1213
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:19,494
Like, we don't know
what's going on

1214
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:23,055
right now with her,
where she is...

1215
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,966
- I know.
- It's just so hard.

1216
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:30,032
It's be a horrible day,

1217
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:32,940
so I'm just gonna
take you home...

1218
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,444
and we'll give
the footage to the police,

1219
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:37,946
um, in the morning,
or what, you know...

1220
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:39,346
We could drop...
we could stop by

1221
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,849
the police station
and give them

1222
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,909
all the information
that we have.

1223
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,586
Okay, we'll do that. We'll stop
by the police station and then...

1224
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:47,146
...wait
a whole night.

1225
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:48,919
Okay, we'll give it
to them tonight,

1226
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:51,153
and then tomorrow, you know...

1227
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:52,820
Did you hear...

1228
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:54,536
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1229
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,192
- Is that...?
- That's the microphone.

1230
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,392
That is it!
Go back!

1231
00:50:57,468 --> 00:50:59,129
That's the microphone, okay.

1232
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,203
- What is that noise?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1233
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:02,535
We must've just passed it.

1234
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:04,471
I don't know why it just
picked up the signal.

1235
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,441
Okay, it has to be...
it has to be one

1236
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,444
of these two houses right here.

1237
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:11,242
Yeah. Yep.
I think so. Okay.

1238
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:13,943
- Keep going.
- I don't see any lights on.

1239
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,884
No, it has to be
those two up there.

1240
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,251
No, you're right.
The signal gets...

1241
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:19,983
Call the police!

1242
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:21,888
All right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna call the police.

1243
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:23,392
- Okay.
- I'm gonna call the police.

1244
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:28,557
What is that noise?
What are they doing?

1245
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,862
Hello? Hello,
this is...

1246
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,959
yes, this is an emergency.

1247
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:34,401
I wanna see my mommy
and my daddy.

1248
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:36,871
- Nathan Riley.
- Tell them she's still alive.

1249
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,204
- I'm hearing her voice.
- Nate, tell them to hurry up!

1250
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:41,574
- Ma'am.
- She's in there.

1251
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:44,409
Yes, we've be following
this car all day,

1252
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:45,607
the Amber Alert.

1253
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,149
Wait! Sam,
what are you doing?

1254
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,515
- Shh!
- Sam!

1255
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:52,350
Oh, my...
yes, ma'am, I'm here.

1256
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,857
No, no. I'm...
everything's fine.

1257
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:58,156
I mean, my friend
just got out of the car.

1258
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:02,597
So... no, she's...
she's safe. It's fine.

1259
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:06,124
Listen, we've been following
this car all day

1260
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:10,299
for the Amber Alert that...
the gray Honda.

1261
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:14,902
Called off? Why? Why did
you call off the Amber...?

1262
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:18,209
I don't understand.
No, ma'am!

1263
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:21,308
No, it's a real emergency.

1264
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:28,916
Listen. We are
at the guy's house, okay?

1265
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:32,553
We... we found
where he lives,

1266
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:35,189
and we need you
to get a patrol car

1267
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:37,233
out to Sandhill Road.

1268
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:39,997
It's this tiny
little neighborhood.

1269
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,561
Sandhill Road.
I don't... I...

1270
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,335
it's one of the houses
in this neighborhood.

1271
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:48,310
I hear a metal noise,
whatever it is,

1272
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:49,936
I hear it coming
from this house.

1273
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,947
- It's in there?
- It's this one right here.

1274
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,415
- It's this one.
- Okay, yes, ma'am.

1275
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:57,477
Sandhill Road.

1276
00:52:57,554 --> 00:53:00,079
- Okay, pull up over here.
- Okay, all right. All right.

1277
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:01,397
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yes, ma'am.

1278
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:03,358
We won't.
We won't do anything.

1279
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:05,952
Okay, you're sending
a patrol car?!

1280
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:09,988
No, ma'am, we're fine.
I'm just talking to my friend.

1281
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,558
We're fine.
We're just... aw!

1282
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:15,969
- Are they coming?
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.

1283
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:17,700
Leave me alone.

1284
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,607
This will be fun.

1285
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:24,078
We 're just...
we're just, uh...

1286
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:25,375
we're playing, right?

1287
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,246
- Oh, my... oh, my...
- That's all.

1288
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:29,308
- What are we gonna do?
- God, that's so gross.

1289
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:31,183
- This asshole!
- What...

1290
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:32,984
What can we do, Sam?

1291
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:35,024
The police will be
here any second.

1292
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:36,684
- Mommy...
- She's scared.

1293
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,318
I know... I know.
Of course she is.

1294
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:40,590
What if we ran your car
into the house?

1295
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,995
I don't like you!

1296
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,158
What? What are you
talking about?

1297
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:46,065
- Sweetheart...
- I'm scared.

1298
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:49,435
- Okay...
- No, we're not gonna run our car into the house.

1299
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,633
At least throw a brick
into the window.

1300
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,006
- I mean...
- That'll stop him, won't it?

1301
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:56,272
No. It might
make things worse!

1302
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:59,008
If you even think
about screaming...

1303
00:53:59,082 --> 00:54:01,744
- What is he talking about?
- Or running, I promise you,

1304
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:03,376
I will go back to your house

1305
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:05,250
and I will kill
your mommy and your daddy.

1306
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:07,017
- What is he... what?
- This freakin' guy's sick.

1307
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,990
- I want my mommy.
- We have to do something.

1308
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,424
We have to do something.

1309
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,359
You have two choices,
here, little girl.

1310
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:15,057
You can either do
what I ask you to do...

1311
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:18,124
What does he mean
he's gonna kill her parents?

1312
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:20,431
...or I will force you
to do it.

1313
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:23,302
- And I might like that just a little bit more.
- Oh...

1314
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:25,204
- What a...
- Do you understand?

1315
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:28,608
He said he's gonna kill...
he's gonna kill her parents.

1316
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,442
I wonder if he's
just scaring here.

1317
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,277
Come on.
Come on, come on.

1318
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:34,044
I mean, maybe
he's murderer, too.

1319
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:36,517
- I guess he's a murd... what?
- Shh. Hello.

1320
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,350
Um, turn it down.
Turn the volume down.

1321
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:39,582
Do what? Shit!

1322
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:43,353
Um, hi. This is
the supervisor.

1323
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:46,055
We, um, you talked
to one of my employees

1324
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:47,790
earlier about text messaging...

1325
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,456
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1326
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:51,728
And the, uh, I know it's late,

1327
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:56,068
but we were re viewing
your case, your account,

1328
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,107
- And...
- Free texting.

1329
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,369
Give him free texting!

1330
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:02,435
We, um, we have
a great opportunity for you.

1331
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:04,639
A limited time only,
we can offer you

1332
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:07,081
three free months of texting.

1333
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,414
Free Internet, free text...

1334
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:11,647
Free Inter...
free Internet.

1335
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:13,781
- Promotional deal.
- It's a promotional deal.

1336
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,052
You need to shut up.
You're too loud.

1337
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:19,562
Uh, yeah. All you have to do
is do, like, a short survey.

1338
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,463
- Yeah, yeah, that's good.
- And it'll only take a few minutes.

1339
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,501
And we'll give you
$200 cash credit.

1340
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:27,764
- $500.
- $500 cash credit.

1341
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:29,362
No. No, no, no.

1342
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:31,304
No, it's not valued...
valuable tomorrow.

1343
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,138
- It's only good for tonight.
- Right, that's it.

1344
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,404
Tonight, we have
to do it tonight.

1345
00:55:34,478 --> 00:55:35,706
We're working on our numbers.

1346
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:37,576
Give me the phone.
I want to talk to him.

1347
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:39,479
- Um...
- I'll be the survey guy.

1348
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,210
- Hello?
- What?

1349
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,445
- Hello?
- What is it?

1350
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,646
What, what, what, what?

1351
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,245
- He hung up.
- Oh, shit.

1352
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:48,587
We gotta turn it back up.

1353
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,753
- Uhh!
- What is going on?

1354
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:56,492
Okay. Now, I'm just
coming back there, okay?

1355
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:59,592
- I just want to come back...
- Oh, my goodness.

1356
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,138
Oh, my goodness,
we have to do something.

1357
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:04,537
I can't just sit here.
I can't just sit here.

1358
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,337
Sam, we have to wait
for the police!

1359
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,207
They'll be here any second.

1360
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,406
- We have to do something.
- I know. They're...

1361
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:13,574
- I can't sit here. I can't sit here.
- Sam! Sam!

1362
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,845
Sam, the police are gonna
be here any second, okay?

1363
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:17,250
It'll be any second.

1364
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,787
Why aren't they talking?

1365
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,652
What is he doing?
What is he doing?!

1366
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,925
- What is he doing to her?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1367
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:26,453
I don't know.
I don't know. Shit.

1368
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,623
Hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

1369
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:29,825
Uh, I...

1370
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,834
Come on, come on, come on!

1371
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:33,699
I... I can't.
I can't sit here.

1372
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,795
Wh... Whoa, Sam, wait!
What are you doing?!

1373
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:37,362
Sam, where are you going?

1374
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:38,703
Sam!

1375
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,401
Sam! Get back
in the car.

1376
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:43,878
Shit! Sam!

1377
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,847
Listen, I'm gonna
go to the store,

1378
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,248
and I'm gonna pick up some
candy for our party tonight.

1379
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:49,910
Oh, God!
Sam, he's coming...

1380
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:52,454
he's coming out of the house!
He's coming out of the house!

1381
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,218
- I'm gonna go to the store...
- He's coming out of the house!

1382
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:57,226
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

1383
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:59,592
...and I'll be
right back, all right?

1384
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,358
- He's coming out?
- Yes, yes, yes!

1385
00:57:01,431 --> 00:57:03,331
- He's leaving.
- But why?

1386
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,664
Wait, wait, wait. He said he was going
to the store to get some candy.

1387
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:07,567
What he said... Caleb,
is that what he said?

1388
00:57:07,637 --> 00:57:09,798
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- He's going to the store.

1389
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,865
- Okay, get down! Get down!
- He's gonna come out.

1390
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:13,534
- He's coming out?
- Yes, yes, yes.

1391
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,237
You think he'll
leave her inside?

1392
00:57:15,312 --> 00:57:17,177
I don't know! I don't know
what his plans are!

1393
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,908
He told her he'd be right back.

1394
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:21,507
- I don't see anything.
- Caleb, you've got to stay down.

1395
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:23,485
Stay down.

1396
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:26,351
I just don't wanna... I just
hope he doesn't see our car.

1397
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,186
Oh, my god, I hope
he doesn't see our car.

1398
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:29,657
Get down!
Get down!

1399
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:31,887
Oh, shit, that's him.
That... he... I saw him wa...

1400
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:33,759
he got in...
he got in that car.

1401
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,764
That... that...
that's not his car, though!

1402
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,198
That's not his car. It's,
like, a white minivan.

1403
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:40,236
Get... Caleb, you'd
better get down!

1404
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:42,863
I'm down.
He can't see me.

1405
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:45,430
Okay, okay, he's going.

1406
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:46,635
I don't think he saw us.

1407
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,870
I don't think he saw our car.

1408
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,275
Okay good.
He's gone!

1409
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:52,782
Whoa-ho! Whoa, Sam!
Damn it!

1410
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,682
Sam! Sa...

1411
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:57,720
Where are you guys going?

1412
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:59,779
Sam, come back!

1413
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:01,380
Come back!

1414
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,796
Pick up, pick up the phone,
Sam! Pick up the phone!

1415
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:17,633
Okay, she's coming back.

1416
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,538
She's coming back.
She's coming back.

1417
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:21,941
She's coming back.
She's coming back right now.

1418
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:27,581
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

1419
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:29,016
Okay, I couldn't see anything.

1420
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:30,677
I need, like, a flashlight.

1421
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:32,847
- Sam...
- Do we have, like, a flashlight in here?

1422
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:34,413
If he caught you
if he came back

1423
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:35,924
from the store
and he caught you,

1424
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:37,550
what are you thinking?

1425
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:38,958
Is there a light
on that camera?

1426
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:40,257
- Sam...
- I mean...

1427
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,657
Okay, here's our window.

1428
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:43,858
We gotta go right now.

1429
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:45,595
- No!
- I need both hands.

1430
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,500
I need one of you
to come and help me.

1431
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:48,892
You need to light
the way so I can

1432
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:50,463
grab her and get in
and do all that.

1433
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,580
Sam, the police are gonna
be here any second, okay?

1434
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:53,973
He could be back
any second, too.

1435
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:55,671
Yeah, exactly.
He could be back.

1436
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:57,440
And he has a gun
and he could kill you.

1437
00:58:57,514 --> 00:58:58,875
Caleb, I need you
to come with me.

1438
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:00,439
We just need to wait
for the police.

1439
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:01,643
No, Caleb is not going, no!

1440
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:03,379
- Nate!
- Are you kidding me?

1441
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:05,717
- He's your little brother!
- Okay, give me the camera.

1442
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:08,451
- What are you talking about?
- This isn't a good idea!

1443
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:11,585
The police are gonna
be here any second. Sam!

1444
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:25,302
Come on!

1445
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,967
Come on!

1446
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,783
Oh, it's...

1447
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,483
How do I get this off?
How do I get this off?

1448
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:53,329
Hey. Ow! It's me!
It's me! It's just me!

1449
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:55,030
Oh, my gosh, Nate,
do not do that.

1450
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:57,596
Let's just get this over with.

1451
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:02,603
This is just... they're,
like, screwed in too tight.

1452
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:08,912
- Uhh!
- Yeah, is it... it's locked?

1453
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,885
Yeah, it's locked.

1454
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:21,790
Here, let me try.

1455
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:25,062
Uhh! Uhh!

1456
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,831
Uhh! Sam, there is
no way in this house.

1457
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:29,769
Aw, shit!

1458
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,773
Sam, what are you doing?

1459
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,934
Be careful!

1460
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,774
You are gonna cut yourself!

1461
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:39,041
- Here, hold the camera.
- All right. Ah... I got it.

1462
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:41,982
All right, so the garage has to
be on the opposite of this wall.

1463
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,145
It's definitely on the
other side of the house.

1464
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,450
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1465
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,925
Let's go...

1466
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:54,927
- Okay, shine the light in here. Yep.
- Okay.

1467
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:09,076
Hey, now, wh... what?
Turn it off!

1468
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:14,912
We gotta go, Sam!
It's too loud, come on!

1469
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:18,113
Let's go! Come on,
come on, come on!

1470
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:23,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1471
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:26,594
Oh, my god.

1472
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:28,654
She's not in there.
Where would she be?

1473
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,723
...Down here.
It's not in here.

1474
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,064
- I don't see it.
- Are you sure it's not in here?

1475
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:35,070
Where else would she be?
I need some light!

1476
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:37,868
Look, look, Sam. There's
something wrong with that.

1477
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:40,205
The girl's not here,
the mic's not here.

1478
01:01:40,276 --> 01:01:42,744
Don't you think there's
something wrong with that?

1479
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:44,177
Well, we need to find the girl.

1480
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:46,511
Okay, well, he said
he was gonna go to the store.

1481
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,063
- Put the light up there.
- I don't...

1482
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,780
See if we can see. It looks
like an attic or something?

1483
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:53,482
All right, just be
careful, all right?

1484
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:57,925
I got the ladder.
I'm holding on, all right?

1485
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:15,472
- She up there?
- I don't see anything.

1486
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:18,139
Oh, my...

1487
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:20,045
Wh-what? What is it?

1488
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:23,176
I don't know.
It's like a bat or something.

1489
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:25,551
All right, come on.
Come on, get down.

1490
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:27,055
I got you.

1491
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:29,785
We have to do this quick, Sam!
He could be back any second.

1492
01:02:29,859 --> 01:02:31,986
I mean, I don't know
how far away...

1493
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:34,553
- Stay with me.
- All right, all right, I'm here.

1494
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,565
I need to see the light.

1495
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:39,966
All right, come on,
come on, keep going.

1496
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:42,197
Nothing there...

1497
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:44,968
- I don't know where else she could be.
- Oh, my god.

1498
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,805
Oh, my god, Sam, he's got,
like, a full arsenal

1499
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:49,742
of weapons over here.

1500
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:53,909
Uh, this gun
is completely loaded!

1501
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:55,644
They're probably all loaded.

1502
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:57,083
Come on, Nate!

1503
01:02:57,153 --> 01:02:58,552
Oh, shit.
Damn it!

1504
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:00,222
I need the light.
I can't see anything!

1505
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,226
I know, Sam, I'm just saying,
like, he's got a lot of guns.

1506
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:08,697
- Hello, little girl!
- Little girl, if you can hear us, make a noise!

1507
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:10,960
Aw, shit.

1508
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:13,696
Oh, my gosh.

1509
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,238
Oh!
Oh, my god!

1510
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,773
Psycho!

1511
01:03:17,841 --> 01:03:20,537
What is this?
What the hell is this?

1512
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,907
Hurry! Come on!
Come on!

1513
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:23,898
- We have to find her!
- I know, Sam, but look!

1514
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:25,847
- Come on, we have to find her!
- Jesus!

1515
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:29,681
Oh, my god.
Wait! Wait!

1516
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:31,192
- Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Come on!

1517
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:32,721
Shh! Shut up!

1518
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:54,972
Nate, if you don't follow me,
I can't see anything!

1519
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:58,013
- Sam! There's something here. I heard something!
- Come on!

1520
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:01,778
There's nothing in here!
Come on, let's go!

1521
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:03,944
Let's go!

1522
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:09,749
No, no, no.
Hello?

1523
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:12,886
- I can't see anything without you!
- I'm... Okay, I'm...

1524
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,930
this is it, Sam!
This is the end of the house!

1525
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:16,863
- There's nothing left!
- ...door.

1526
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,628
- What, is it locked?
- It's locked.

1527
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:19,963
All right, here.
Take this.

1528
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:21,298
She has to be in there.

1529
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,804
Take this.
Aw, shit.

1530
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,999
All right.
All right.

1531
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:27,634
Ohh! Here, I'll take it.
I'll take it.

1532
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,008
I'll take it.
I got it.

1533
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,377
Oh, my god.

1534
01:04:33,983 --> 01:04:35,917
What is this place. What...

1535
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:37,816
Right over here. Put it over here.
Let me see.

1536
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,912
- This is some kind of...
- Is there anything back there?

1537
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:41,650
Some kind of trophy room
or something.

1538
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:44,056
Now, careful.
There's a lot of...

1539
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:45,992
Hello? Ugh!

1540
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:48,326
Oh... don't touch it.

1541
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:49,888
We have to be faster, Sam.

1542
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:51,900
I mean, this is...
we're taking way too long.

1543
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:54,801
Oh, I think...
I think I found something.

1544
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:57,897
- What?
- Looks like there's maybe another room

1545
01:04:57,974 --> 01:04:59,339
or something.
Shine it.

1546
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:01,001
- Okay.
- Get the light in here.

1547
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:02,772
Yeah, don't... don't...
don't just...

1548
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:04,073
wait, wait, wait.
Oh...

1549
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,341
Hurry!

1550
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:08,683
Get in here!

1551
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:11,117
- I need some light!
- All right!

1552
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:12,381
Hurry up!

1553
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,331
- Oh!
- What?

1554
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:27,096
- What is it?
- Stay over there, Nate.

1555
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,331
What? Did
you find her?

1556
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,339
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

1557
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:32,806
What?

1558
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:38,072
There. Are you okay?

1559
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,707
- Sam?
- What's your name?

1560
01:05:40,783 --> 01:05:42,808
Don't worry,
we're here to help you.

1561
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:44,716
We're here to help you.

1562
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:46,846
Don't, don't, don't.
She's w... she's already...

1563
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:49,357
Are you okay?

1564
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:52,394
- What?
- It's gonna be all right.

1565
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:54,259
We're here to help
you. Don't worry.

1566
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,763
Oh, God, she's in a cage!

1567
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:57,459
- Nate, stay back.
- She's in a cage!

1568
01:05:57,533 --> 01:05:59,797
It's okay. Don't scare her!
Don't scare her!

1569
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,131
Are you okay, sweetheart?

1570
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:02,432
She's already freaked out!

1571
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:03,972
Sweetheart?

1572
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,405
- Oh, my gosh!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1573
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,136
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- The mic.

1574
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,700
- What?
- He knows we're here!

1575
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:10,905
- He knows we're here!
- I told you! I knew it!

1576
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,039
Okay, hurry.
Get something to open this.

1577
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:15,846
- What? Okay!
- Like, something to pry it with. Hurry!

1578
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:17,408
I'm hurrying!

1579
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:29,897
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

1580
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:32,833
- Cover your eyes.
- Is she all right?

1581
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,769
We need something harder.
This is not gonna work.

1582
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:38,136
Sometime heavier or...

1583
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,038
All right,
all right, all right!

1584
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:43,101
Sam, there's nothing in here!
It's just a bunch of shit!

1585
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:44,737
Hurry!

1586
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:48,978
Uh. Aah!
I found a hammer!

1587
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:51,452
I found a hammer!

1588
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:52,954
Hurry! Good, good!

1589
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:55,320
Here, take it,
take it, take it!

1590
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:58,992
Oh, God.

1591
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:01,053
It's not working!

1592
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:05,191
Watch out. Aaah!

1593
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:07,133
All right, get back.
I've got the hammer.

1594
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:11,303
Caleb, are
the police here? What?

1595
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:14,138
- He's here.
- The guy is at the house.

1596
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,077
- He's going in right now.
- Oh, no, we gotta go.

1597
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:19,046
Guy's got a gun...

1598
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:21,811
Caleb, you better run! Run!

1599
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:23,818
- Run, Caleb!
- Caleb!

1600
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:25,877
We gotta get her!
We gotta get her out of here!

1601
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:27,923
Grrr!

1602
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,891
All right, help me!
I can't do it by myself!

1603
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,291
- We have to go!

1604
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:34,455

1607
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:40,197
- We have to!
- Grrr!

1608
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:41,930
We have to get her...

1609
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:46,838
Come on!

1610
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,902
Oh, oh!

1611
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,278
Are you okay?
All right, are you okay?

1612

01:07:57,987 --> 01:07:59,249
Come on. Hurry.

1615
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:00,846
I'm coming.

1616
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:02,584
We got you.

1617
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:05,593
Oh, Sam, be quiet!
Shh shh shh!

1618
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:08,994
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1619
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:11,363
- Shh. Turn the light off.
- We have to be quiet.

1620
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:13,026
He could be anywhere.

1621
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,403
Okay.

1622
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,869
Shh.

1623
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:31,180
- Not yet.
- Where are we?

1624
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:33,484
Hang on.
Come on, come on.

1625
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,446
Sam, keep her quiet.

1626
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:04,008
Shh, shh, be quiet. Be quiet.

1627
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:06,919
- Okay?
- You're okay. You're okay.

1628
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,067
Shh...

1629
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:31,474
We're almost there.

1630
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:50,291
Here, take the camera.
Just take it, take it.

1631
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,231
- Okay.
- Okay?

1632
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:56,670
Where are you going?
Where are you going? Nate!

1633
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,438
Nate! Where are
you going?

1634
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:37,739
Okay, so, um,

1635
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:40,207
I know we've been, like,
really kinda like, uh...

1636
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:41,743
- Goofing around.
- Goofing around.

1637
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,403
Having a good time.

1638
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,606
- Which is always good.
- I wanna say right now

1639
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:49,048
that, um, and I know I haven't
talked to you about this,

1640
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:53,350
but, like, I don't know if I'm
gonna see you, like, after this.

1641
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:55,219
You know, we only
have a few more years,

1642
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,225
maybe, we're gonna
be friends hanging out,

1643
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,124
and you're gonna,
you know, what happens

1644
01:11:59,195 --> 01:12:00,835
when you find some guy
and you get married

1645
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,693
and you go off and whatever...

1646
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:05,325
- Well, we'll always be friends.
- I won't see you anymore.

1647
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:07,164
Yeah, but you know
how people's lives

1648
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:09,227
kind of take different paths.

1649
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:10,602
So, this is, I feel like,

1650
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:12,641
One Last race will be,
like, maybe,

1651
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,199
our last big
adventure together,

1652
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,768
like, one that will,
like, be...

1653
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:20,509
go out with a bang, you know?

1654
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,210
How do you feel about that?

1655
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,343
Yeah, I think we'll be able
to have a lot of fun

1656
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,115
and kind of act like kids,

1657
01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:29,282
like we have been for the
last few years, and...

1658
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:31,121
'Cause we're not
getting married...

1659
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:32,785
Are we?

1660
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:34,796
Do you wanna marry me?

1661
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,661
- I'll... I'll do it.
- Yeah, right.

1662
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:38,393
Why are you laughing like that?

1663
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,833
Have you never even
thought about that?

1664
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:43,394
You never thought
about us, like, you know?

1665
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,633
I like you. You're, like,
one of my best friends.

1666
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,335
Oh, okay.
That... okay.

1667
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:49,310
I love you! You're,
like, my best friend.

1668
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:52,211
I know, okay, I love you too.

1669
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:53,543
But...

1670
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:55,311
I'm too fat.

1671
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,375
I'm just kidding.

1672
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:58,681
I'm sorry.
It got awkward.

1673
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:00,278
But, I mean, you...
but... but...

1674
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:02,153
you know, seriously, though...

1675
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:03,521
No, I know what you're saying.

1676
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,526
Like, yeah, who knows
what's gonna happen

1677
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:06,891
in the future with our lives

1678
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:08,793
and growing up
and having to be,

1679
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,559
maybe, responsible adults.

1680
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:11,861
Right, so?

1681
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,424
Mm-hmm.

1682
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:15,197
I wanna have, you know,

1683
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:17,501
like, one last
big thing with you.

1684
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:20,303
- It's cheesy.
- No, it's not cheesy.

1685
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:21,809
Can we kiss right now?

1686
01:13:23,379 --> 01:13:24,744
No, your brother's right there.

1687
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:26,839
Never mind.
Just kidding.
