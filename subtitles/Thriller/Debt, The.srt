1
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,167
Breathe.

2
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,512
We should never forget
how young they were.

3
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,017
My father,
Stephan Gold,

4
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,853
was the youngest
unit commander in Mossad.

5
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,859
David Peretz had his 29th
birthday while on the mission.

6
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,119
When my mother crossed
through the checkpoint,

7
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,537
into Soviet-controlled
East Berlin,

8
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,540
she was only 25.

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,789
They'd had the courage to
confront an unimaginable evil.

10
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,926
A man whose
sadistic experiments

11
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,634
left thousands
disfigured or dead,

12
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:15,102
who became known by a name which
defiles the annals of medicine,

13
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,355
the Surgeon of Birkenau.

14
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,771
Their mission had
been to capture him

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,902
and return him
to Israel to stand trial.

16
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,455
Instead, it ended on the
streets of East Berlin.

17
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,670
These three dared to relive
Israel's greatest nightmare,

18
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,081
her greatest pain.

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,419
And in the simple act
of facing the monster,

20
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,759
they helped to vanquish it.

21
00:02:54,966 --> 00:03:00,689
This book is dedicated
to my inspiration,

22
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,942
my mother, Rachel Singer.

23
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,489
Mother.

24
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,027
Mother,

25
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm so very proud
to be your daughter.

26
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,304
David Peretz?
Yes.

27
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,726
You were expecting me?

28
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,729
Yes, I was
expecting you.

29
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,439
Would you come
with me, sir?

30
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,406
Let's go.

31
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,218
Are you all right, sir?

32
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,469
Sorry, I think I..

33
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,741
When are you
going to stop?

34
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,743
Stop what?

35
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,165
The smoking.

36
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,997
I gave up alcohol.
What more do you want?

37
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,420
Okay, soon.

38
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,253
I hope so.
Do it for your grandson.

39
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,586
I've marked the place.
Perhaps from Chapter 11.

40
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,090
Good. Thank you.

41
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,513
You must be very proud.

42
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,014
Yes, I am.
It's a great achievement.

43
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,317
I'm very proud of her.

44
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,195
And I'm sure you were
invaluable in the research.

45
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,107
Actually my mother
withstood all interrogation.

46
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,029
My father was the talker.

47
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,328
I'm the only journalist in
Israel she won't speak to.

48
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,241
I thought
he couldn't come.

49
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,705
Sit down.

50
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,913
So did I.

51
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,206
My God, it must be
election season.

52
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,550
Papa, you came.

53
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,385
I came.

54
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,599
Rachel.
Stephan.

55
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,302
Okay.
So, you're the expert.

56
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,888
Maybe you can
tell me something.

57
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,432
Who is the handsome
devil on this cover?

58
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,231
It went well?

59
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,653
She was wonderful.

60
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,565
That's good. Good, good.
That's very good.

61
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,741
I just want
to thank you all

62
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,663
for coming to celebrate the
launch of this wonderful book.

63
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,787
And I'm sure we are all
particularly thrilled

64
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,795
to have two of the heroes of the
story here with us tonight.

65
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,925
And even more thrilled that one of
them has agreed to read for us.

66
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,673
Miss Rachel Singer.

67
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,318
"On the evening
of the 31st of December,"

68
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
"it began to rain
more heavily."

69
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,116
"So isolated had they become
from the outside world,"

70
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,415
"that it was only when she
looked out of the window"

71
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,460
"that Rachel remembered
that it was New Year's Eve."

72
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,127
"There were fireworks
in the sky,"

73
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,839
"and everyone else in Berlin
was celebrating."

74
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,340
What's so important?
Where are we going?

75
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,252
We're going to
Daviol's apartment.

76
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,470
David?

77
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,842
I know he came
to see you yesterday.

78
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,179
What's this? The jealous ex-husband
or the intelligence officer?

79
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,892
What did he want?

80
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,943
He told me that he'd been traveling,
that he'd been teaching.

81
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,197
We spoke for a few minutes,
and then I had to go.

82
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,157
If you don't believe me,
ask him yourself.

83
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,996
Why did he do it?

84
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,842
My car
is waiting outside.

85
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,726
Come down!

86
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,091
I'm David.
I'm Rachel.

87
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
Stephan.
This is Rachel.

88
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,882
Where do I sleep?
You're in my room.

89
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,503
I'm moving in with him.
You're at the end there.

90
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,683
What do you think
of your new wife?

91
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,730
- She's too young.
- Very pretty.

92
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,312
You didn't notice.

93
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,143
You know what
I've noticed?

94
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,355
You olon't notice women.
I've noticed that.

95
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,863
How long have
I known you?

96
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,486
I don't know.

97
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,992
Two years.

98
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,946
All the places we've been to,
you never look at women.

99
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,366
Is there anything you have to tell
me before I get into that bed?

100
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,268
I think
you just noticed.

101
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,819
Yes?

102
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,413
Now from behind.

103
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,496
Where have you come from?

104
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,701
Argentina.

105
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,583
Really? Whereabouts?
Cérdoba.

106
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,669
What were you
doing there?

107
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,547
My husband is an
industrial chemist.

108
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,091
He does look
like a chemist.

109
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,013
She's not going
to break, David. Move.

110
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,348
What were you
doing before this?

111
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,028
Before Argentina
we lived in Hungary,

112
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,447
where my husband
studied chemistry.

113
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,445
In Mossad,
what did you do?

114
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,576
Liaison.

115
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,120
And what did you
do in Liaison?

116
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,122
Translator.

117
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,626
Translator?

118
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,795
So, first time
in the field?

119
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,501
Good. That's good.

120
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,807
Welcome to the mission.

121
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,816
The West
Berlin Transit System.

122
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:45,605
When the Wall was built, some
stations ended up on the wrong side,

123
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,569
in the Eastern sector.

124
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,451
They're closed and
guarded by soldiers.

125
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,904
They will shoot to kill
to prevent any escape.

126
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,782
This is where
we get him out.

127
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,163
It's a ghost station.

128
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,087
West Berlin trains pass through
the station on this track,

129
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,090
- but don't stop.
- Usually.

130
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,759
One, two, three, four..

131
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,720
Fourteen seconds
per train.

132
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,014
The station is guarded
at all times.

133
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,355
And the stairs to the
platform are sealed off.

134
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,688
Our train driver makes an
unscheduled stop under the bridge.

135
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,078
The last two carriages
will be around here.

136
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:31,825
They will be empty.

137
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,781
Once the train is stopped, the guards
won't be able to see this fence,

138
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,949
or anything that
happens beyond it.

139
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,412
And on the other side of the
fence is a postal depot.

140
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,922
The vans come and
go all day long.

141
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,835
We 're just one more
van with one more parcel.

142
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,929
And once
we're in West Berlin,

143
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,723
there will be transport
to Tempelhof air base,

144
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,342
and a private
charter to Israel.

145
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,438
That's the wrapping.
Now all we need is the present.

146
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,828
Try this on.

147
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,381
How does it feel?

148
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,637
Very nice.

149
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,349
Here you are a Mossad agent,
all those years of training,

150
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,275
the highest levels of
marksmanship and krav maga,

151
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,436
and your first big
mission is sewing.

152
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,401
Black belt
in dressmaking

153
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,611
I never argue with
an armed woman.

154
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,942
Sorry.

155
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,258
What is it?

156
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,464
It oloesn't have a name.
Shit.

157
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,880
Now it does.

158
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,846
Today is my birthday.

159
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,861
And study the Mishnah.
At 15, you study the Talmud.

160
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,526
By 18, stand under
the wedding canopy.

161
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,107
We're too late
for all of those.

162
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:42,323
You're 29? In your 20s, you have
to pursue your life's goals.

163
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,082
What are you
pursuing, Rachel?

164
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,040
I olon't know.
I'm waiting to find out.

165
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,545
Youth.

166
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,799
What about you, old man?
Have you got a goal?

167
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,426
Yes, we believe
in goals in my family.

168
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,295
We're very driven men.

169
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,340
My father was Director of
Collections by the time he was 50.

170
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,883
So what's your goal?

171
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,676
Director of Collections by 40.

172
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,901
What about you, David?
What life goal are you pursuing?

173
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,063
This is it.

174
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,732
This is it?
This is all you want?

175
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,319
No, tell me.
What do you want out of life?

176
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,414
I want to get Vogel.

177
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,749
I want him to be put on trial,
and I want the world to watch

178
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,919
so everyone knows
what he did.

179
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,796
I want them all
to know the truth.

180
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,094
And I want another drink.

181
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,612
Forget about it.

182
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,782
Forget about what?

183
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,612
I've spent two years with
him and I don't know him.

184
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,321
Nobody knows him.

185
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,205
He's alone.

186
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,783
What about family?

187
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,454
All of them?

188
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,840
All of them.

189
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,803
Maybe it's not always
a blessing to survive.

190
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,734
Frau Roget.

191
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,274
Are you all right?

192
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,974
His identity's confirmed.
We have a green iight.

193
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,643
The day after tomorrow.

194
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,547
It's a brave thing
you're doing.

195
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,671
I'm not brave.

196
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,136
I'm terrified.

197
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,475
But you're doing it anyway because
you know how important it is.

198
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,235
David..

199
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,829
It's whiskey.

200
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,307
You're so beautiful.

201
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,647
We have to get him on the train.
Help me with him.

202
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,122
We're going! Now!

203
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,953
Not without her.

204
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,113
Go! Go!

205
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,964
Jump!

206
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,839
Down!

207
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,205
- Is he dead?
- Who?

208
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,288
The guard. The one who saw your face.
Is he dead?

209
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:14,702
No.

210
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,044
How did Vogel come round?
How the fuck did that happen?

211
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,254
You gave him
the full injection?

212
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,637
Did you give him
the full injection?

213
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,589
I olon't know.
I thought I did!

214
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,598
We failed our mission.

215
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,433
It's not over.

216
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,224
We failed our country.
We failed our families!

217
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,272
We still have him!
It's not over!

218
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,192
We still have him!

219
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,440
You made contact?

220
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,402
Is there a plan?

221
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,233
What did they say?

222
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,438
It's going to take time.

223
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,571
They need to open
up a new route.

224
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,403
They need to find
political help.

225
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,656
They're going to
try the Americans.

226
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,208
So, we work in shifts
guarding him.

227
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,289
We feed him at the
end of each shift.

228
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,800
We take him back alive.

229
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,758
You've been seen.
You don't leave the house.

230
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,174
We can do this.

231
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,306
We'll take him
back to Israel.

232
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,929
We'll show the world
what he did.

233
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,699
STEPHANI Fuck.

234
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,795
You can't talk to him.

235
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,043
I didn't say anything.

236
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,341
You can't listen to him.
I know.

237
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,214
I'm not angry,
I'm just telling you.

238
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,591
We don't talk to him.
We don't listen to him.

239
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:20,008
He isn't there.
He isn't a human being.

240
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,771
We've been given a date.

241
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:30,647
Ten days' time.
The Americans are going to help.

242
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,311
Good.

243
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,904
No.

244
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,898
You should try
lemons, for the morning sickness.

245
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,610
They say it helps.

246
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,411
What's your name?

247
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,914
Hannah? Sarah?
Rachel? Esther?

248
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,626
You Jews stay close
to your roots, don't you?

249
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,002
It's a good thing.

250
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,632
Very good.

251
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,593
I understand you perfectly.

252
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,388
You weren't lying
at the clinic

253
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,845
when you told me about
your mother, were you?

254
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,264
About her death?

255
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,522
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

256
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,534
What happened?
Nothing. Nothing.

257
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,043
What's the matter?

258
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,919
He can understand us.
What?

259
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,963
He just spoke to me.

260
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,716
He knows what we're saying.
He knows what we're thinking.

261
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,969
It's all right. It's all right.
This will be over soon.

262
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,175
Why olidn't you go?

263
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,428
At the station. You could have got away.
Why didn't you?

264
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,500
What did they say?

265
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,169
DAVIDZ Stephan?

266
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,135
It's not happening.

267
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,545
What the fuck
does that mean?

268
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,755
The Americans
have pulled out.

269
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,930
Has he been fed?

270
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,800
- Oh, God.
- Did you feed him?

271
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,806
What's the plan now?
We just need to get him to the air base.

272
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:57,886
I'm asking you.
What's the..

273
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,221
I'm talking to her!

274
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,268
Supposedly
it's her shift now,

275
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,146
but instead of doing what
she's supposed to be doing,

276
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,351
she's out here with you.

277
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,187
Now, answer the fucking question!
Did you feed him?

278
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,647
Yes, I fed him.

279
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,985
There's no plan.
There's no fucking plan!

280
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,196
The police are everywhere.
They're searching houses.

281
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,207
We killed a man, and now the
Americans want to pullout.

282
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,959
They won't have
anything to do with us.

283
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,538
It's a fucking mess and they're backing
away from it as quickly as they can.

284
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,956
No.
They can't leave us.

285
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,211
Yes, they can.

286
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,626
Because we fucked it up.

287
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,086
We fucked it all up,
and now we're on our own!

288
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,136
No.

289
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,387
Were you followed?

290
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,727
Could you
have been?

291
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,596
Stephan.

292
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,853
Stephan.
Stephan.

293
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,726
If it's them, he dies.

294
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,065
Move!
You're not doing this.

295
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,772
He's not getting away
from me. Move.

296
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,739
This isn't the mission.
Move!

297
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,697
You are not doing this.
Get out of the way.

298
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,074
This isn't what
we came for.

299
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,747
I decide what
the mission is.

300
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,872
We're finishing this.

301
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,370
Get out of the
fucking way!

302
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,378
It was the lady from
the basement apartment.

303
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,589
She invited us
to a New Year's Eve party.

304
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,971
We'll get Out.

305
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,771
They'll come up
with another plan.

306
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,488
What are you doing?

307
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,999
It's your shift.

308
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,084
Did you know about this?
About what?

309
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,171
His mouth is taped.
You want him to suffocate?

310
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:34,342
I was sick of seeing his face.
Go back in there.

311
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,213
You don't do it again.

312
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,600
You olon't
give orders, David.

313
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:46,188
It's your shift now.
So go back in there. Go on.

314
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,982
Stop it!

315
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,862
We're not animals.

316
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,693
You remember what we are.

317
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,242
You remember
what we are not.

318
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,707
What are you doing?
I have to get out.

319
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:07,992
You can't.

320
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,999
Get out of my way,
please. I'm going out.

321
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,162
She wants to go out.

322
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,873
A few minutes.
I won't be seen!

323
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,087
- Tell him, David. I just want to walk.
- Rachel..

324
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,459
You can't go out.

325
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,386
I just want some air!
I can't breathe!

326
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,504
Rachel..

327
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,214
Get off men.

328
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,281
Thank you, David.

329
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,006
If I had a choice, I would
prefer Rachel to feed me.

330
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,431
So gentle.

331
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,975
In another life, the makings
of a nurse, I think.

332
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,440
How is she today?

333
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,190
You should let her
get more rest.

334
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,775
It's a dangerous time, the first
month or two of the pregnancy.

335
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,153
You didn't know.

336
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,871
And you're not the father.

337
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:37,374
I thought it would be you.
I thought.. I don't know.

338
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,386
The way you look at her.

339
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:47,635
The way she looks at you.
That must be hard.

340
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,729
I wouldn't have taken
Stephan as a family man.

341
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,813
Too ambitious, too..
I don't know.

342
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:00,652
Whereas you, David,
I see you with children.

343
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,986
Shut up.

344
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:08,489
I'm expressing my sympathy
for your sufferings.

345
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,830
What does a monster like you
know about suffering?

346
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,545
I'm a doctor, David.

347
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:21,840
You blind children trying to
change the color of their eyes.

348
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,345
You inject people
with petrol.

349
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:28,725
You replace hands and legs
and you watch as they..

350
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,604
This isn't medicine.
This is sickness.

351
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,235
This is disease.

352
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:44,366
So we were all insane?
Is that the answer?

353
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,619
There is no answer.
I'm not looking for an answer.

354
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,279
I'm not looking to..

355
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,086
You're trembling.

356
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,464
I think you're the one
that is afraid, David.

357
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,879
Afraid of the monster.

358
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,048
Boo!

359
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,943
Why do you think it was so easy
to exterminate you people?

360
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,613
Your weakness.

361
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,281
I saw it.
Every day I saw it.

362
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:33,244
Every one of them thinking only
of how to avoid being flogged,

363
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,749
or kicked or killed.

364
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,082
Every one thinking
only of themselves.

365
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,539
Why do you think it
only took four soldiers

366
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,505
to lead a thousand people
to the gas chambers?

367
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:50,516
Because not one out of thousands
had the courage to resist.

368
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,517
Not one would
sacrifice himself.

369
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,812
Not even when
we took their children away.

370
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,642
So I knew then that you
people had no right to live.

371
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:00,938
You had no right..

372
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,790
Are you going
to be all right? Yeah.

373
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,631
Out!

374
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,422
Out!

375
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,422
Nothing. Not a trace.
Nothing at all.

376
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,553
He might go to the house,
try and get a message..

377
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,430
He's not going
to the house!

378
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:43,807
He's gone!

379
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,595
Fifteen years
it took to find him.

380
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,349
He's gone and no one's
ever going to find him again.

381
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,611
So we what?
Are you going to make the phone call?

382
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:58,399
Are you going to tell them how he
got a fucking piece of broken bowl?

383
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,443
Wonderful. Don't try
and take me down with you.

384
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,028
I've done nothing wrong!

385
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:07,119
Remember that. This can't happen!
This is never going to go away!

386
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,366
It's my fault.

387
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,834
It was my shift.

388
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,708
This happened
because of me.

389
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,464
I let him go.

390
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,257
And no one's ever
going to find him again.

391
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,298
No one's ever
going to find him again.

392
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,731
What if he didn't escape?

393
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,114
What are you
talking about?

394
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,275
Only four people know
what happened in this room,

395
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,360
us and him,
and he's not talking.

396
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,529
No one will ever
hear from him again.

397
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,368
No.

398
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,790
Nobody needs to know
what happened.

399
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,121
He escaped.

400
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,577
That's the truth.

401
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,879
But that doesn't have to be
the truth we take home.

402
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,501
The truth can be anything
we want it to be.

403
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,839
The truth is Vogel
tried to escape.

404
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,635
You struggled with him
and got hurt.

405
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,798
The truth is seconds
before he got away,

406
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,638
Rachel got the gun
and shot him.

407
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,474
The truth is we got rid of him.
Got rid of the body.

408
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,310
Got rid of every trace
of the Surgeon of Birkenau_.

409
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,524
We can't lie about this.

410
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,811
No, you know what?
We have to. We have to!

411
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,651
This isn't about us.
This is about Israel.

412
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,277
This is a national
humiliation!

413
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,108
We can't be seen to fail!

414
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,704
And in the end, Vogel rots
away his life in some jungle,

415
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,406
always looking over his
shoulder, waiting for a bullet.

416
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,497
Who's to say? Maybe that's a worse fate.
Maybe that's..

417
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,663
The important thing
is justice.

418
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,799
Justice is seen to be done.

419
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,051
He's gone.

420
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,883
What does it matter?
He's gone.

421
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,266
He's right! It makes no difference.
No difference!

422
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,927
All we have to agree is that
we never talk about this.

423
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,388
No matter what happens,
we never tell anyone.

424
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:58,060
The truth stays in this
room, between us. Agreed?

425
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:04,277
Say it.
I need to hear you say it.

426
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,077
Say it.

427
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,456
Agreed.

428
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,585
David.

429
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,918
Rachel, say it.

430
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,508
It's an oath.

431
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,668
Say it.

432
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,393
Say it.

433
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,070
How could this happen?
You said he would never speak!

434
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,366
You said he would
never be heard from.

435
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:49,659
We don't know it's him!

436
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:50,952
Oh, God.

437
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,156
If you read it,
you'll see that..

438
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,456
He's alive!
He's in the Ukraine!

439
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:55,579
What else is there to read?

440
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,160
It's a little
Internet story.

441
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,417
Psychiatric patient claiming
to be the Surgeon of Birkenau!

442
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,206
Some crazy old man.

443
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,959
How did you find it?

444
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:09,005
David comes back after all
this time, I want to know why,

445
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,431
I have his
apartment searched,

446
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,429
we find that
on his computer.

447
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,601
Did he say anything
to you about it last night?

448
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,942
Rachel,
did he say anything?

449
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,313
Why? Why did
he kill himself?

450
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,864
Because
he couldn't handle it.

451
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,741
I told him
we had to deal with it,

452
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,193
and he couldn't handle it.

453
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,699
He thought the whole story would
come out and he panicked.

454
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,286
"Deal with it"?

455
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,128
What does that mean?
"Deal with it."

456
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,132
I told him to find Vogel.

457
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,793
I told him to finish it.

458
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,645
Did you know
he'd been ill?

459
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,936
You did, didn't you?
You knew he'd been ill. You knew it!

460
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,103
Fuck David.

461
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:07,564
You knew that he
wasn't strong enough!

462
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,068
He took the
coward's way out.

463
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,525
You could have
just left it alone!

464
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,985
It was an old man
in a hospital.

465
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,241
Nobody would have believed it.
Nobody would be listening.

466
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,449
There's a journalist
from a newspaper in Kiev.

467
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,159
Yuri Titov.

468
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,205
He heard about the story and
he wants to interview Vogel.

469
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,968
Then it all falls apart.

470
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:36,509
We don't know which hospital he's
in, but the journalist does.

471
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,803
You have to find
out where he is.

472
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,604
What are you talking about?

473
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,937
David has taken himself out of
the equation, I can't do it.

474
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,647
You're the only one left.

475
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,353
Are you insane?

476
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,273
We can't___
Well, I can't do it. I can't!

477
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,026
Look at me.
I'm not capable.

478
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,070
I haven't been an agent
for 30 years.

479
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,457
You're insane.
No, I can't do it!

480
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,709
You have to do it, Rachel.

481
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:07,207
Because for 30 years you've
been taking the credit for it.

482
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,715
And there's Sarah.

483
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,557
I'm not doing this!

484
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:50,708
Fuck!

485
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,122
I knew
this would happen.

486
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:26,036
I knew we'd be punished.
I knew we'd have to pay.

487
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,625
I thought I'd been
punished already.

488
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,457
God doesn't
plant car bombs.

489
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,342
I wasn't referring
to the wheelchair.

490
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,598
If I could go back, Rachel,
I would change it all.

491
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,637
But there's one thing
I would never change.

492
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,017
She isn't going
to find out.

493
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,029
She can never find out.

494
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,922
Come down!

495
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,665
At that moment, when I
was lying on the floor,

496
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,585
I don't think I was thinking
about myself at all.

497
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,506
I was thinking
about my mother.

498
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:46,430
I was thinking about how she had
suffered in Europe during the war.

499
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,688
The same question
to Mr. Peretz.

500
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,274
Fuck him.

501
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:06,286
Fuck him.

502
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,666
Hurry up.

503
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,468
Goto bed, Sarah.

504
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,355
Welcome.

505
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,653
You both look so beautiful.
I'm spoiled for choice.

506
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,410
Are we still
on for Sunday?

507
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,715
My own party, and you're
the only friend I have.

508
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,348
All Stephan's friends.

509
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,977
Stephan's girlfriends.

510
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,484
Don't even think
he's interested in them.

511
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,357
He's just trying
to punish me.

512
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,822
For what?

513
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,574
Everything.

514
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,573
For getting pregnant.
For not loving him.

515
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,365
For you, David.

516
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:44,051
I thought the silence was for
the soldiers, not for me.

517
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,300
David, I'm talking to you.

518
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:48,631
I'm leaving.

519
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,184
What? Leaving Mossad?

520
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,887
Yeah, Mossaol_ Israel.

521
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,941
Where are you going?

522
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,895
I don't know.

523
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:08,902
Greece at first,
and then I don't know.

524
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,288
When?
Tonight.

525
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,787
Don't be crazy.

526
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,163
Rachel..

527
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,414
Don't be crazy. Tonight?
Why would you?

528
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,619
Rachel.. Rachel..

529
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,873
You can't leave.
You can't just.. I have to.

530
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,549
Why? Because I can't
do this anymore.

531
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,132
Any of this.

532
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,677
If I stay..

533
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,346
I don't know.

534
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,353
This is about today.
About the talks?

535
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,021
Don't do them anymore.
Stephan doesn't___.

536
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,317
Come with me.

537
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,448
What?

538
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:51,869
Come with me.

539
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,454
I can't.

540
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:55,830
You can.

541
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,659
You can.

542
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,293
Such a beautiful
photograph, Rachel.

543
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,875
It's beautiful.
You look like a pair of angels.

544
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,961
She's so lovely, Stephan.

545
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,217
You like it?
I took that one.

546
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,923
Good to know you
have another career.

547
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,470
In case you
fall from favor.

548
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,340
It could be
sooner than you think.

549
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,386
Rachel, will you come
and say hello to Michael?

550
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,646
He was asking after you.

551
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,897
Yes.

552
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,250
Oh, no.

553
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,425
I'll tell you something,

554
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,799
at that moment
when I was on the floor,

555
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,048
I didn't think
about myself at all.

556
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:28,228
I was thinking about my mother and
what she had suffered in Europe.

557
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,731
And I think that was what gave
me the strength to get up again.

558
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,570
Does Stephan
know you're here?

559
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,576
I expect so.

560
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:46,956
Things became
very bad between us.

561
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,577
What are you
doing here, David?

562
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:13,057
He's in the
Babenko Hospital.

563
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,942
It's just outside
of Vinnycja.

564
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:20,106
About 250 kilometers
southwest of you.

565
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,274
What name is
he going under?

566
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,286
Ivan Schevchuk_
He's the right age.

567
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,454
And when is Titov
supposed to interview him?

568
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,617
Tomorrow.
And he knows what I look like.

569
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,797
This will be over soon.
And when..

570
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,190
What are you
doing here, David?

571
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,647
Have you
met anyone else?

572
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,278
There was someone,
but he went away.

573
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,355
And I never heard
from him again.

574
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,366
I wrote you letters.

575
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,818
But you never sent them.

576
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,611
Rachel..
What is it, 25 years?

577
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,492
I wanted to see you.
All that time and not a word.

578
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,915
I was ill for a
long time, Rachel.

579
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,618
I was in a kind
of hospital.

580
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,834
Where?
In Mexico.

581
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,919
What were you
doing in Mexico?

582
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:25,008
I traveled a lot. South America,
North Africa. I kept moving.

583
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,514
Looking for him.

584
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,018
Why?

585
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:38,016
What would you have done
if you had have found him?

586
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,359
I would have
told the truth.

587
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,445
I would have gone to
a newspaper and said,

588
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,323
"”This is the
Surgeon of Birkenau."

589
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:52,490
And I could finally
have seen him face trial.

590
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,408
And what would have
happened to us?

591
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,372
We'd be free.

592
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,663
Whatever happened to us,

593
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,748
it seemed to me
we would be free.

594
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:04,375
Don't you agree?

595
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,720
Aren't you tired of lying?

596
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,639
If you had found him, isn't
that what you would have done?

597
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,730
Maybe.

598
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,026
Twenty years ago.

599
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,531
But now?

600
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,702
Anyway, it isn't
just us, there's Sarah.

601
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,663
She hasn't done
anything wrong.

602
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,034
She wrote a book.
Did you know that?

603
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,289
Yes.

604
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:41,831
If the truth were to come out
now, it would destroy her.

605
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:47,799
So no. I would not
have told the truth.

606
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,552
But you never found him.

607
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,432
No, I never did.

608
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,613
The book launch
is tomorrow.

609
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,442
Could you come?
I don't know if Stephan..

610
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,656
What if we could go back?

611
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:17,287
If I had waited for you.
If you had come.

612
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,119
Would it be different?

613
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,830
We can't go back.

614
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,513
- Yes?
- It isn't him.

615
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,521
Wait a second.

616
01:38:57,056 --> 01:39:02,062
This is a family matter, if you'd
give me a moment, please. Thank you.

617
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,029
You're sure?
It isn't him.

618
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,699
It's some old man
who's heard about him.

619
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:16,617
Thank God.

620
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,124
Thank God, this is wonderful.
This is..

621
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,630
And you're okay, Rachel?

622
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,543
You were wrong.
Well, thank God I was..

623
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,218
About David.

624
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:28,221
You were wrong about him.

625
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:29,722
About David?

626
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:34,011
He didn't kill himself because he was
afraid the story might come out.

627
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:40,100
When he came to see me,
he was asking for something.

628
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,319
What?

629
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,321
My permission.

630
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,067
And I didn't give it.

631
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,659
I wouldn't let him
tell the truth,

632
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,076
and he was tired
of living with a lie.

633
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:01,542
Truth is a luxury, Rachel.

634
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:04,799
Some people have to
put other things first,

635
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,252
their country, their
people, their children.

636
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:14,847
Sarah is so proud
of you, Rachel.

637
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,682
I want her to
be proud of me.

638
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,104
Of course you do.

639
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:23,651
I want to do something
to make her proud of me.

640
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,279
Vogel must have
been here, Stephan.

641
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:31,784
Rachel.. People have to
know the truth, Stephan.

642
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,032
Rachel, listen to me.
Goodbye.

643
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,295
Sir, the Cabinet
meeting has started.

644
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:46,965
Yeah.

645
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,793
Why did you come?

646
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,089
Why did you have to come?

647
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,800
Was it Schevchuk?

648
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,934
I know I shouldn't
have talked to him.

649
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:25,140
I can stop him.
I won't tell him anymore.

650
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:21,816
"My name is Rachel Singer."

651
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:26,454
"Please publish what
you are about to read."

652
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:33,456
"In 1965."

653
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:39,501
"I was part of a mission
to kidnap Dieter Vogel,"

654
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,129
"the Surgeon of Birkenau,"

655
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:47,759
”and bring him to
Israel to stand trial.

656
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:59,111
”We have always claimed that Vogel
was killed trying to escape.

657
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:05,447
"But this was a lie."

658
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:11,623
"A lie I have lived
with for 30 years."

659
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:22,923
"And now I understand
that I must tell the truth."

660
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:55,400
