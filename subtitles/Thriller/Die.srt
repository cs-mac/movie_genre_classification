2
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,039
You should be in bed.
-I do not sleep.

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,838
What are you doing?

4
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,191
I'm not sure yet.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,875
Them.

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,590
Go to sleep now. -But ...

7
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,359
Jacob!

8
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,272
In autumn 2005, consisted of
between six foreign liaison

9
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,952
police "cooks" designated
by the terrible events.

10
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,711
This is their story.

11
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,274
Going somewhere?

12
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,474
I need to go to the patient.
I will be late.

13
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,596
Father, menemmehän game tomorrow?
-Absolutely.

14
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,393
But the conditions are these:

15
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,196
You must be well-behaved
and do as mother says.

16
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,031
We'll see.

17
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,836
....
This man has changed lives, often
in a better direction.

18
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,636
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
my good friend Robert Moretti.

19
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,075
I will be brief, that we're
drinking and eating.

20
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Times are tough for many, and
many of us going so well.

21
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,793
We want to see them or not,
they are everywhere.

22
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:34,190
Today I ask you, which you have paid one thousand U.S.
dollars Dinner

23
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,995
think about what
else you can do.

24
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,392
Do not forget the rest of the world
just because you're doing well.

25
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,235
Hopefully you are hungry, because
this is an expensive dinner.

26
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,192
Free yourself Start a new life

27
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,435
Hey, Sofia.
What are you still doing here?

28
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,713
I was hoping that we could talk.
-Okay, sit down.

29
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,676
I meant somewhere else.
-You can offer me a drink.

30
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,959
Okay, let's go for a drink.

31
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,632
Say you get married and
return to Italy.

32
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,510
They came to visit yesterday.
Two people.

33
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,872
Why do not you?
-I know you better than anyone.

34
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,275
Answer the question.

35
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,033
They want me to prove that you were under
the influence while shooting him.

36
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,793
It's funny.
I pulled you into this hell,
and now do you get me out.

37
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,994
I'm not going just for this work you out.
I do not intend to prove.

38
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,911
When you have seen such things which I, begins
to live according to their own rules.

39
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,750
You can not take the law into your own hands.
-It 's over, Sofia. I'm gone.

40
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,190
At my age a man starts
to look back-

41
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,348
and the purpose of looking for something,
something to be proud of ...

42
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,353
I have looked behind me, and
I do not see anything.

43
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,519
I see only darkness
and ugliness.

44
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,518
When I moved here from Italy, I left everything behind.
Do you understand?

45
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,514
You can still change things.

46
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,589
There is no place where to escape
from what I have become, Sofia.

47
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,719
Hello.

48
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,559
What has happened?
A car accident.

49
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,037
Parents and two daughters.
The oldest and parents died,

50
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,917
The youngest is paralyzed from the neck down.
He is in room 309

51
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,397
I can stay to keep an eye
on him if you want.

52
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,713
You look exhausted. Go home.

53
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,829
Sorry. It went a bit violent.

54
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,752
That probably covers it.

55
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,635
Have we're even?

56
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,959
Do you understand?
Have we're even? -Yeah.

57
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,396
Where? -Home.

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,555
Thirteen.

59
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,279
Over.

60
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,111
Seventeen.

61
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,997
Twenty.

62
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,710
Sometimes, when luck is not on my side,
it could be switched to finish.

63
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,437
Does not involve luck.

64
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,072
Vodka, please.

65
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,155
Thank you.

66
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,188
Not to worry.

67
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,756
Wake up now.

68
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,429
All is well.

69
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,229
Nothing to worry about.

70
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,356
What's going on?
Where am I? -We do not know.

71
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,588
Who are you?
How long have you been here.

72
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,636
We do not know.
We woke up just like you.
-Who brought us here?

73
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,916
It is trying to figure out.
Why so much effort to see
kaappaamiseksemme?

74
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,349
Here you must be a way out.

75
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,632
We have tried everything.
Here is not no way out.

76
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,234
Hey, baby. I'll handle this.

77
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,557
I'll do you get out of here.

78
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,072
Everything will be okay.

79
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,111
Not organized.

80
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,752
It's time.

81
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,231
You must follow me.

82
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,274
This way.

83
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,630
Be careful.

84
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,796
Sit down.

85
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,595
Listen. Listen to this moment.

86
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,269
I just need a minute
of your time.

87
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,838
You do not need to do this.
I would like to cooperate.
Do you understand?

88
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,431
You you're doing.
It is going very well.

89
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,950
At peace now.

90
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,309
Follow me.

91
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,560
Open it.

92
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,716
Pick up the dice.

93
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,111
What is this? Noppa-six pages.

94
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,473
You let fate decide
Robert's life.

95
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,475
I can not do it.
You, if anyone can.

96
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,558
Roll the dice.

97
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,710
If you do not act, he will die without
the opportunity to be reborn.

98
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,674
Now you understand.
Roll the dice.

99
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,830
What came from?

100
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,669
This is your game.
-This is not a game.
Do not be tricky.

101
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,076
Put a bullet in the gun.

102
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,270
Listen.

103
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,359
We can agree on something.

104
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,873
I have a lot of money.

105
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,629
This is not about the money.

106
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,312
He dies within five seconds.
Five. Four.

107
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,591
We can agree on something.

108
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,672
Three.

109
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,352
His life is in your hands, Mark.
Two.

110
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,235
Next hits him on the head.

111
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,349
Two wasted opportunity to save him.
It was stupid.

112
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,710
Yes or no?

113
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,957
I'll do it. -Do it.

114
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,834
You can do it. One occasion.

115
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,030
Do it!

116
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,399
Seems to suicide.
Robert Moretti.
The gun was in his hand.

117
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,913
He founded varankeruuohjelman victims of the recession.
Billionaire.

118
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,831
Dressed up as a beggar in front of his own house.
A devilish way to
send a message.

119
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,473
Press falls for this.

120
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,755
Speaking of the boss wants to press
the body away before entry.

121
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,275
You would not be able to do anything.
It's not your fault.

122
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,157
How does it change the fact that
I shot their brains on the wall?

123
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,958
He knows her. -What do you mean?

124
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,517
Recognized him when
you saw his face.

125
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,234
If you know something, say it.

126
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,432
I do not know him!

127
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,193
I do not know who he is, who you are,
or what the hell are we doing here.

128
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,238
I just want to ...

129
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,512
There is no place where to escape
from what I have become, Sofia.

130
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,150
Tomorrow you go to work ...

131
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,876
... You call them and
tell the truth.

132
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,151
That's it. Lorun end.

133
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,550
It is God's will.

134
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,870
Go away.
-You can still change things.

135
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,078
What are you doing here still? Go to sleep.
-I have to go to the morgue.

136
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,752
He shot himself, that's it.
We already have enough to do.

137
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,560
Mark here.
Leave a message, I'll call back.

138
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,799
Did you find anything? -Kind of.

139
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,311
I have looked at a head injury.
Angle of the bullet
does not match.

140
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,959
The bullet went in here, went
down and came out here.

141
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,269
Set would have had to hold it.
Possible but not likely.

142
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,793
I think someone else
shot higher.

143
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,593
How about this?

144
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,034
Small burns.

145
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,676
Strange ... It is also this one.

146
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,873
What is it?
, Came before the shooting.

147
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,676
Maybe he defended himself? -I doubt it.
No signs of struggle.

148
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,148
And no sniper osaisi to clean and stitch the wound.
Why bother?

149
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,515
To make this appear to suicide.
Then, head trauma is a
better proof of that.

150
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,317
Could you write a report? -Sure.

151
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,478
FATHER'S FOLDER

152
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,317
I told you to go home.

153
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,679
Come with me.

154
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,710
He can not very well.

155
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,116
You gotta see it.

156
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,913
Not ... -Open the box.

157
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,318
They are not for you.

158
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,956
I do not touch them,
you sick bastard.

159
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,992
Ingredients are easy to find:

160
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,513
Pseudoephedrine, iodine, red
phosphorus matchbox ...

161
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,552
Sure, you know.

162
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,232
Junkie used the dose may be
as high as 10 milligrams.

163
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,150
If you throw one, he gets 10 mg.
If you roll a six ...

164
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,670
... He gets 60 mg.

165
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,669
Put in our bodies almost by
just to keep us alive.

166
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,717
Melody's body has struggled so much
that he will probably take 50 mg.

167
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,078
But you ...
He hardly takes more than 30 mg.

168
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,358
Show your arm.
Show him how it feels
to grow without love.

169
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,155
A wasted life, neglected,
forgotten, and the ugly.

170
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,478
All of which were rejected
by the love for him.

171
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,310
So damaged that she had poisoned
herself to feel alive.

172
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,275
If your mother could see you now, do
you think he finally care about?

173
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,798
Sometimes we have more in common
with foreigners than we think.

174
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,400
Throw noppaa.Anna her new life.
-Do not do it.

175
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,910
For 10 seconds of time.
Ten. Nine. Eight.

176
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,873
Seven. Six. Five.

177
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,230
Four.

178
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,476
Three.

179
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,315
Two. -Excuse me.

180
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,515
Your body is fighting
to keep you alive.

181
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,069
It is the darkest truths that must
be close to death, saved.

182
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,512
Così ho tanto amore ... Fri te.

183
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,476
I told you to go home.

184
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,594
Torrential evening?

185
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,840
The worst of my life.

186
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,080
What were playing? -Blackjack.

187
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,957
You would have tried the dice.
-I do not play dice.

188
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,552
Statistically, the blackjack is the only
game in which players have a good seam.

189
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,319
There are three types of lies:

190
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,309
Vale, whacking lie ...
-... And statistics.

191
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,190
How many lost?

192
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,069
More than I could afford.

193
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,875
I have a suggestion.

194
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,957
You believe in statistics
and probabilities,

195
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,674
and I believe in destiny.

196
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,272
I suggest that this time you
let fate be resolved.

197
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,233
Odd I win.

198
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,593
You have to make one, three,
or five things that I ask.

199
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,314
An even you win.

200
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,470
For two, four or six
thousand dollars.

201
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,595
You're not serious.
-Death serious.

202
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,756
One, three, or five things ...

203
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,474
What kind of things?

204
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,752
I do not know yet.

205
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,879
Do you leave things often
in the hands of fate?

206
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,113
You will not guess at all.

207
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,909
Play.

208
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,477
You lost. -You win.

209
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,271
You do not need to give money.

210
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,552
Dice will not resist.

211
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,117
I can not take them.

212
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,674
Go home, Lisa.

213
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,630
Go home.

214
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,957
Six thousand chips, thank you.

215
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,990
Zach!
-What are you doing
here, Claire?

216
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,032
I need some stuff now. Now.

217
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,473
I am not a drug dealer, Claire.
-You are a psychiatrist.

218
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,435
Recipe should be enough
for at least a month.

219
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,470
Did you take your kids in?
-Who weakling vahtisi
at this time?

220
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,672
Clear. Calm down now.

221
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,271
I want what you have at home.

222
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,996
Wait in the car.
I will bring it there.

223
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,790
He is hungry.

224
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,552
Promise me you will not take them before you get home.
They are very strong.

225
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,875
Claire!

226
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,476
Survive this, I promise.

227
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,912
Stay awake.
You need to stay awake.

228
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,157
Stay awake.

229
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,476
Do not touch me!

230
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,916
Do not touch me!

231
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,998
Let her go!

232
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,709
You. Your turn.

233
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,232
Do not do this.
I can help you. Seriously.

234
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,869
The same way as for
helping to Claire?

235
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,320
What's happening here?
Who are you?
-Would, if I had a name?

236
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,788
I certainly would like
to tuoliisi analysis.

237
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,998
You will kill me before
I do anything to him.

238
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,236
He died.

239
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,474
Claire.

240
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,550
Her child was crying for 12
hours before someone heard.

241
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,114
Exactly.

242
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,152
Such you have become.

243
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,319
Would you like to save the Melody?
This is your chance.

244
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,869
I ...

245
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,314
I tried to save them, but ...

246
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,872
... I could not help everyone.
-I know how you feel.

247
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,068
Lets see how successful now.

248
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,751
Give a little, so you may save them.
Too much, so they die.

249
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,998
The difference is that
this time fate decide.

250
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,113
It is much safer, right?

251
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,714
Roll the dice.

252
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,478
Give him a new life.

253
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,590
Look at me.

254
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,956
Look at me.

255
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,192
You need to listen to, so you're
ready to see what happens.

256
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,792
You know the world does not understand
you when you return.

257
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,993
But they can see what
you have become.

258
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,274
They see ...
They see what they look like.

259
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,150
Check for all the hospitals?

260
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,629
Okay, thanks.

261
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,628
This was the third.
He was naked in the middle
of the street.

262
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,275
The taxi was driven over him.

263
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,678
He says there is no other.
No name, no papers.

264
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,950
She was probably raped.

265
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,200
He had a stitch marks on the hands and
wrist burning traces of tobacco.

266
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,429
He's just a kid.
Steven center, said he
saw something similar.

267
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,557
Hello.
I am a detective Valentin.

268
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,478
My name is Sofia.
What is your name?

269
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,270
You have traces of burning
on the wrist.

270
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,555
Do you remember how
you got them?

271
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,796
You can tell if you were a street girl.
I did not come to arrest you.

272
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,514
I came to help you.

273
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,999
Do you know this man?

274
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,629
Have you seen him before?

275
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,515
If something happened, if
you know something ...

276
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,950
Other lives are at stake.

277
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,709
You can help me to save them.

278
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,910
You will not be able
to save anyone.

279
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,759
He argues that the feeling of Moretti.
-Why did he conceal something?

280
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,671
Robert Moretti killed himself.
If you want to murder,
it is sufficient here.

281
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,078
In the case of a murderer,
why did not he been dead?

282
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,591
Both had burns in the same
place, as the characters.

283
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,077
Moretti was labeled number
one, he was number three.

284
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,510
She felt Robert Moretti.

285
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,950
Did he say so?

286
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,353
Let me tell you what it is.

287
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,634
You're tired, your partner has disappeared,
and the areas to be paranoid.

288
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,630
Do you see what is happening here?
People are afraid, Sofia.

289
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,197
Latest miss paranoid wild accusations
by the police.

290
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,596
Vuodit Moretti story the press-

291
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,077
and therefore we may find a pile of burning
junkies traces here and there.

292
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,636
I did not speak magazines.
-That 's enough.

293
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,676
We are talking about, when you have something useful.
Go home now.

294
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,873
Hold a public holiday.

295
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,271
Could you make a list during
the last week lost?

296
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,519
I look forward to.

297
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,435
Hey ...

298
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,078
Show me your hand.

299
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,996
Show me your hands.

300
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,156
What is that?

301
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,753
I have two.

302
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,519
How did you get those?

303
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,915
Now I get it.
We do not want to talk about
it, but because we are here.

304
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,272
It is unique, what unites us.

305
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,313
We were chosen because we were
trying to kill ourselves.

306
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,434
No, we are condemned.
We suffer so that we can
be cleansed of our sins.

307
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,995
Do you realize how
insane you are?

308
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:12,595
These damn idiots ...
I can not stand this anymore.

309
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,037
We condemn, Mark.
It is God's plan.

310
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,474
God? What happened to you? Tell your story.
I want to hear.

311
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:30,152
We are here together.
Come on, tell me now.

312
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,956
I've seen before God for
all believers sighted.

313
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,359
Something happened to them, and
they seek God all the answers.

314
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,510
Do you want to know why am I here?
Since I do not care anymore
about anything.

315
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,758
I've lost the ability to feel.

316
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,714
A month ago I got an alarm.

317
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,152
I was close to the house,
so I went there.

318
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,874
The door was open,
so I went inside.

319
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,439
And there he was, middle of the room
slaughtering knife in his hand.

320
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,236
He had broken in, stabbed the
mother and three children-

321
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:20,152
and put the bodies into the
ring the living room.

322
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,389
Then he turned to me and said:
"This is God's will."

323
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,831
God does not exist, Diane.
Not a plan.

324
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,752
Only you and your actions.

325
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,080
What has happened?
A car accident.

326
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,397
Parents and two daughters.

327
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,671
The oldest and the parents died.
The youngest is paralyzed
from the neck down.

328
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,878
How long has he been missing?

329
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,072
Three days.

330
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,193
Did he say anything
before leaving?

331
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,474
He was ...
worried about their work.

332
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,390
It is confidential, and I've
always respected it.

333
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,760
If you know something, it
can help in finding her.

334
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:07,351
He has been depressed for two years.
He is forced to leave.

335
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,918
He ordered too many drugs
for some patients.

336
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:20,071
Being investigated, and he
has not taken it well.

337
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,313
I ...

338
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,238
What, Mrs. Emmett?

339
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,592
I fear for him.

340
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,350
I'm afraid he hurt himself.

341
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,511
Can I keep this?

342
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,158
Please look for my husband.
Her children need her.

343
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,956
I'll try.

344
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,477
Do you think my nagging for fun?

345
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:22,469
I wonder what happened
to it last year?

346
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,393
Mark?

347
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,190
Take the computer lab.

348
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,869
These were found beside the bed.
Liquid antidepressants.

349
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,551
His office is a mark here,
the weapon is gone.

350
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,837
Can we have a minute?

351
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,592
Are you okay? -Yeah.

352
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,075
It's over. Go home.

353
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,716
We loved all of your father.

354
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,517
But I will allow a move here just because
you went to Mark the warranty.

355
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,031
He was like a father to you, but
the thing is you get too close.

356
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,278
You can not do this.
-You are no longer
my hommissani.

357
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,077
You closed my father's story before we had the answers.
Do not do it again.

358
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,230
Mark took the drugs and has disappeared.
Would you like to visit as well?

359
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,912
My father did not kill himself.
And how do you explain this?

360
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,797
Mark did not want to be snubbed,
and satuit face the thief.

361
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,835
Or do you not tell the whole story?
Go home.

362
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,273
Let me out!

363
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,671
What's going on?

364
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,280
What's happening?
-But you understand it, Zach.

365
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:48,951
Eksyneestä the case of a woman.
Eventually, death was
the only way out.

366
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,791
He made the impossible, was rejected by
his faith, and jumped off a bridge.

367
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,436
He sank into a river
full of remorse,

368
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,758
but hey, the story
ended, or what?

369
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,078
God would not let him die.
Not yet.

370
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,998
Someone rescued her.

371
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,716
But he was not fully rescued, as
he still made his death inside.

372
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,108
You're here because
you chose it.

373
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,599
Again can only be getting
a new life.

374
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,272
You must choose to face death and
see it in the eyes of another.

375
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,715
Who is really gone?
Who deserves a second life?

376
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,917
We do the opposite.

377
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,560
I can not respond to his death.
-It is part of God's plan.

378
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,273
How do I save him?

379
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,472
Tell me what to do.

380
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,191
They are one, and Zach is below
the surface for one minute.

381
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,959
Save him!

382
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,072
Save him!

383
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,715
Save him!

384
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,429
Save him!

385
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,468
Dice INTENT

386
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,111
We tried.

387
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,911
This is a test.

388
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,868
You must not let this break you.
You did everything you could.

389
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:57,030
I had a daughter.
He was born ill.

390
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,280
Have you ever held a sick
child in your hands?

391
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,076
It does so painful, that
the heart is broken.

392
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,794
I heard my daughter's
painful cries ...

393
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,754
... I could not do anything.

394
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,954
He died in my arms
two years of age.

395
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,952
I I would die with him.

396
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,593
I'm sorry.

397
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,915
Your wife has been missing for
five days, and you notice now?

398
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,272
This is not the first time.
My wife often disappear-

399
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,188
and then appears as if
nothing had happened.

400
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,390
Sean!

401
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,035
Thank you.

402
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,830
He has escaped from
Sean's birth.

403
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,875
We suspect that he has been hijacked
by a very dangerous person.

404
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,039
All these data would be helpful.

405
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,316
He began to drink Sean is born.

406
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,989
He stopped studying.
We had money worries.

407
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:22,275
He began to play the fewest our money.
I do not know much
about his doings.

408
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,076
Do you have photographs of
Lisa, which I could take?

409
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,319
Thank you.

410
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,829
What's your name? -Jacob.

411
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:56,438
I no longer want to die, Jacob.
-It is no longer in your power.

412
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,992
You can not do this.
He did not want to die.
-I 'm here decided, it's you.

413
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,955
Not him. Not so.

414
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,437
I decided I did this, it's you.

415
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:24,193
The body is about six liters of blood.
Liter may be released
without danger.

416
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,836
Two liters of going into shock.
More than three liters
to know death.

417
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,512
If you throw four or more,
his body will die.

418
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:41,514
You were lost for more than two
liters, when I found you.

419
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,791
Not ... -Yes.

420
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,310
Is not it ironic.

421
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:11,437
You've got my blood, but still
I know you to be a part of me.

422
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,634
Open the box. -No ...

423
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,558
Roll the dice.
Give him a new life.

424
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,359
No, no ...

425
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,192
Give me a second chance.
-Our Father which
art in heaven ...

426
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,437
Stop, please.

427
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,319
No, I do not want! Please!

428
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,874
Good Lord, no!

429
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,632
For thine is the kingdom ...

430
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,758
Stop it! No!

431
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,555
Why did you have requested.
It was not easy.

432
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,072
Did you read this?

433
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,433
Crazy.
Re-birth, the dice according
to the will to live ...

434
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,518
Do you think the book of wet?
-I do not know.

435
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,952
What did you find the author?
-His name is Jacob Odessa.

436
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,234
Jonah's father built half of the city
and shot himself in the age of 60,

437
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,629
9-year-old Jacob's next.
He has toured in mental
hospitals all his life.

438
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,959
1995, he tried to kill himself and
ended up in a Roman hospital.

439
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:11,918
He got the name of patients' Jacob Odd.
" He wrote a book
in the hospital.

440
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:17,478
He returned in 2000, sold their
possessions and disappeared.

441
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,192
Sofia ... Be careful.

442
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,873
Yeah? -Did you get the book?

443
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,433
Who's there? -I am looking for.

444
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,314
See you at 4507 B
South Side Layer.

445
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,040
Come alone.

446
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,750
What are you doing?
-Give me yours.

447
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,159
Mark?

448
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,396
What are you doing, Mark?
-I am not going to
die like them.

449
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,719
I do not like this. No, Mark ...

450
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,356
Mark ...
No, Mark. You can not do this.

451
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,519
Look at me, Mark.

452
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,509
Do not do this, please.
Look at me, Mark.

453
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,234
Look at me!

454
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,749
Mark!

455
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,350
Do not do this, please.
-I 'm sorry, Lisa.

456
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,355
No! Good Lord!

457
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,319
Help him, somebody!

458
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,356
Hurry up!

459
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,716
Help him!

460
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,559
"When you have seen the
kind of what I" -

461
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,719
"Begin to live according
to their own rules."

462
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,390
Do not you?

463
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,158
Stay here.

464
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,794
Do not move.

465
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,553
You need to go.
Find a way out of here.

466
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:53,118
What are you gonna do?
-I have to stop this.

467
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,995
You have to get involved. Go.

468
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,515
This is over.

469
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,194
This is over, when
I say that it is.

470
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:48,075
You have to stop at the end of the search
and start looking for a new beginning.

471
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,550
Are you alone? -I.

472
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,638
Follows.

473
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:43,716
You control a nice man.
Here you do not get
a lot of guests.

474
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,757
You do not understand well enough what is happening.
You have not been warned enough.

475
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,318
I have lived here for three years.
I have not seen the light
of day in three years.

476
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:01,275
They are found everywhere watching us.
You will certainly feel them?

477
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,358
Who? -Sekopäät.

478
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:10,077
Religions have abandoned the people,
governments have betrayed

479
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:15,593
They are looking for some salvation.
-As the book?

480
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,750
It just does not take into account time of publication,
but it started something like:

481
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,474
Tests.

482
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:35,316
Studies in people who have decided
to discontinue life-

483
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,513
faced with the death of dice.

484
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:44,760
Surviving are completely, but
they never talk about it-

485
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,714
because they know the other observing.
-Who is the other?

486
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:55,029
The disciples, the survivors, joined the
cult, who live according to the dice.

487
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:01,713
So suicide is murder, the victims
of the experiments?

488
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:07,392
If you examine in more detail, you will
see that many had been marked.

489
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,320
Suicide is not just entertained.
People are dying constantly.

490
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,638
You were a part of this?
-Yes, I survived.

491
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,278
When I got back out, I tried to
expose it, to tell my story.

492
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,198
It then appeared to
be a good idea.

493
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,996
They are so desperate that doing
anything to protect him.

494
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,910
His disciples consider him a savior.
-Jacob Oddia? Jacob Odessaa?

495
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,952
Congratulations, you've
done your homework.

496
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:46,394
Her family built a half of the city.
He sold everything, except one.

497
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:53,119
The only place in the city in which
to decide the fate of the dice.

498
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,956
Are you one fails?

499
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,117
Of those who were floating
in rivers.

500
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,632
Which is found lifeless
and forgotten forever.

501
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,833
Or synnytkö again?

502
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,198
You told me once: "At my age a man
looks back searching for meaning."

503
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:31,072
We offer a purpose.
Opportunity to change lives,
starting with yourself.

504
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:38,519
Dice chose you.
You will be entered
in the sixes.

505
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,520
You get to choose from.

506
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,314
I'll make it easy for you.
It is the last choice ever.

507
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,509
Start a new life in
the old or die.

508
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,233
You have not thought about this the right way.
Otherwise, you know ...

509
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,150
... That I ...

510
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,315
... I fear more to life ...

511
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,072
... Than death.

512
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,554
You're not my father.

513
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,597
I knew that the Palais.

514
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,473
You killed him.
-No dead can not kill, Lisa.

515
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,993
They had their established lives of prisoners.
I gave the opportunity
to start over.

516
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:58,311
I have to go back.
Do you understand?
I need to get my life back.

517
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:05,596
You think you can come back to kill me?
This is not no turning back.

518
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:11,670
You've changed, reborn,
awakened to life.

519
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,718
What if I ask you to join me?
Give me a new life?

520
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,674
Rescue me, as I saved you?

521
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,798
Do not move!

522
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,554
Maybe not.

523
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,596
Please do not get your problem?

524
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:55,589
If you kill me, there is nothing to
hold you in the right direction.

525
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:01,590
Vajoat probably on
the bottom again.

526
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,474
I do not have to rescue you.

527
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,678
If I die ...

528
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,279
... You die.

529
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,994
Maybe we meet again in another life.
Maybe all is different.

530
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,272
Police!

531
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,115
Do not move!

532
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,752
Do not move and lower the gun!

533
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,195
Lisa?

534
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,233
Can you hear me? Danger is over.

535
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,636
Take him.

536
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,349
At my age ...

537
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,634
... Starts to look back ...

538
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:38,352
... And look for something
to be proud of.

539
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,913
Something which is supposed to.

540
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:04,356
I have looked behind me.

541
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,317
I do not see anything.

542
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,918
Eventually I will die alone.

543
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,994

willing to start over.
