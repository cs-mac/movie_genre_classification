1
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,100
- Now what's happened?
- There are two men outside.

2
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,735
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

3
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,015
- What were they doing, honey?
- Mom, look! He's got a gun!

4
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,779
Come on, upstairs.

5
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,687
- Quick!
- Come on, we're gonna go up.

6
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,499
God in heaven!

7
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,864
May you be damned for eternity!

8
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,004
It's your choice.

9
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,443
Garr.

10
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,184
- How you doing, lion?
- Good to see you, Chief.

11
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,192
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Garret Smith, Homer Foxx.

12
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,422
"- The Garret Smith?
- The Homer Foxx?"

13
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,035
- Well, yes. Nice to meet you.
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.

14
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,232
"- The Josephine Fabrizio.
- Jo. Of course."

15
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,307
Forgive me.
Miss Fabrizio works on the paper too.

16
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,070
- My pleasure.
- Won't you join us?

17
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,769
I have a minute. Why not?

18
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,438
- Sit down, Chief.
- Thank you.

19
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,584
Homer's been trying
to talk me into running for mayor.

20
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,746
- Mayor?
- Would you support that?

21
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,620
I would,
but it doesn't mean the paper would.

22
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:33,754
Would you and Miss Fabrizio come to
a small gathering to discuss the matter?

23
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,924
' A party?
<i>'</i> Why not?

24
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,093
This is all off the record.

25
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,465
I haven't decided yet.

26
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,302
<i>Excuse me.</i>

27
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,772
Doyle.

28
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,144
You're not supposed to call me
on that sort of thing.

29
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,247
How many?

30
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,151
Jesus.

31
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,555
Right. Right, I'm on my way.

32
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,232
I gotta run.

33
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,392
Jo, take care of the bill.
Nice to have met you, Mr Foxx.

34
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,164
Same here.

35
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,443
This way, Chief.

36
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,819
- What's it look like, Scully?
- Real bad.

37
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:33,924
- I don't think you'd better come in.
- He's OK.

38
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,361
You guys, in here.

39
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,499
We got one in the bedroom there.

40
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,762
This one down here.
Third one round the corner there.

41
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:49,203
Upstairs, well, you just won't believe it.

42
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,505
- What do you say, doc?
- 12-gauge shotgun, probably.

43
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,844
I gotta call in for technicians and all the
wagons the coroner can come up with.

44
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,612
One thing we don't need
is the media here.

45
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,314
He's a friend, Scully.
Of mine and the department.

46
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,818
- What's that?
- Beats me.

47
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,766
- Who blew the whistle?
- Some kid. Said he lives down the street.

48
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:24,706
Came over to play, didn't see anybody
outside so opened the door and came in.

49
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,000
There's Mr Beecham now.

50
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,321
Hey, what's going on here?

51
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,716
- Mr Beecham.
- What is it? What's wrong?

52
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,885
- I'm afraid there's...
- What is it?

53
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:21,658
- Mr Beecham, do you have enemies...
- What's happened?

54
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,294
No! Wait! Wait!

55
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,404
Piety! Oh, no! Let me go!
What are you doing?

56
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:38,574
Oh, the children! The children too!
Oh, no, not the children!

57
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:44,314
Oh, not the children!
Oh, God, no! Not the children!

58
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,481
You...

59
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,696
Oh, God, no!

60
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,663
Dear God. Sweet savior.

61
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,604
Dear God, you have my whole family now.

62
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,067
Be with them, God, please.

63
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:46,578
- Come on, Garr. Come to bed.
- In a minute.

64
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,355
You've done the piece.
Stop thinking about it.

65
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,621
- You didn't see that place.
- You made me see it.

66
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,889
You made all of Denver see it.

67
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,185
- Have a look at that.
- What is it?

68
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,723
An avenging angel.

69
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,626
It's Mormon. Old Mormon.

70
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,468
Got something I wanna show you.

71
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,601
It's a piece I wrote on the massacre.

72
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,770
I've seen it.

73
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,982
- Treating you all right here?
- Yes.

74
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,685
They tell me you refuse to talk to them.

75
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,695
Nothing to talk about.

76
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:43,892
- Don't you want them to catch the killers?
- The Lord God will deal with them.

77
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,038
Not the police.

78
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,302
- Do you know who killed them?
- It is not your business.

79
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,207
It is not the business of any Gentile.

80
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,146
By Gentile I guess you mean
anyone who isn't a Mormon.

81
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,842
You're gonna need help, Mr Beecham.

82
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,055
They're not gonna let you go
unless you talk to them.

83
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,216
At least tell them why you think
this happened and who you think did it.

84
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,329
The reason they're holding me,
what they told me,

85
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,931
is that I'm in danger myself.

86
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,363
I don't want their protection.

87
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,163
Can I get you a lawyer?

88
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,670
Jeez.

89
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,575
You're gonna need someone.

90
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,111
There must be someone you can trust.

91
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,872
HEY, guard!

92
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,479
Could I trust you?

93
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,925
Hi. Where can I find Willis Beecham?

94
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,466
- Turn around.
- What?

95
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,038
Hey!

96
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,906
Looks like we got a live one here.

97
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,952
"This guy's a newspaperman.
Denver Tribune."

98
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,521
- Big leagues, eh?
- You'll also find a gun permit in there.

99
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,393
Sure enough. But it's Denver.

100
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,928
Ain't worth cow dab this part of Colorado.

101
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,829
- You guys police?
- This is a private community.

102
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,735
Do you know what we're talking about?
We're the law here.

103
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:39,276
- I have to see Mr Beecham.
- Why do you want to see the prophet?

104
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,779
<i>They have excommunicated us,</i>

105
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,148
they say. They...

106
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,530
...proclaim it from their pulpits

107
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,301
in their gold-encrusted temples.

108
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,613
But hear me well.

109
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,944
Understand me well.

110
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:24,653
Know the Antichrist comes
in the guise of a friend.

111
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,291
In the guise of your own brother.

112
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,722
You must recognise him

113
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,291
and smite him!

114
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,371
Your own brother, smite him!

115
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,065
Annihilate him!

116
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:50,306
Obliterate him from the face of the earth,
and all his progeny.

117
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,279
<i>Amen!</i>

118
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,821
The Lord is in me.
Feel his arms around us.

119
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,861
Feel his strength.

120
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,830
The Lord is my shield and my sword.

121
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,369
<i>The Lord is my shield and my sword.</i>

122
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,336
"- Amen.
- Amen."

123
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,725
- Garret Smith.
- Oh, you know my name?

124
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,556
- You're a journalist. You are not welcome.
- So I've noticed.

125
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,566
We don't want journalistic attention
and you are not one of our faith.

126
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,934
I'm here, sir, because
I have a message from your son Orville.

127
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,874
If Orville wished to send a message,
he would not entrust it to a Gentile.

128
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:32,379
There's been a terrible tragedy,
Mr Beecham.

129
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:37,420
Orville's entire family...
You can read it here.

130
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,089
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

131
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,565
- Or... Orville...
- Orville's in jail.

132
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,734
- Jail...
- It's only for his own protection.

133
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,896
He told me to tell you he'd be here soon

134
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,872
and that you were not,
and he emphasized this,

135
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,569
you were not to take action until he's here.

136
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:07,276
Did he tell you the name of the Antichrist?

137
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,420
No, sir.

138
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:16,255
Zenas! Zenas Beecham! My own brother!

139
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,629
Put that in your newspaper, Mr Smith.

140
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,761
- Where can I find Zenas Beecham?
- It is not for you to find him.

141
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,898
It is for God to...

142
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,403
God will find him.

143
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,906
You'd better leave, sir.

144
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,277
<i>Willis, sir...</i>

145
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,490
- Anything?
- Beechams all over the place.

146
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,858
No Zenas.

147
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,063
Chief Doyle, please.

148
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,877
Property taxes.
See if you can patch into property taxes.

149
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,776
Right.

150
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,383
<i>Yeah?</i>

151
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,452
Barney. How are you?

152
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,612
Listen, I'm doing a follow-up.

153
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,190
I wanted to find out
if you had anything else.

154
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,486
Not a hell of a lot, Garr.

155
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,119
A lot of Orville's fingerprints,
which figures, since he lived there.

156
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,630
A lot of empty shells, 12-gauge.

157
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,031
We're analyzing them for fingerprints,

158
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,694
what batch they came from,
where they were bought.

159
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,832
- It's a long shot.
- How's Orville? He talking to you yet?

160
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,837
- No. We let him go.
- You let him go?

161
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,642
It was that or charge him.

162
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,615
I hope you have somebody
keeping an eye on him.

163
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,382
Well, we tried to, but we lost him.

164
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,082
Oh, Jesus, Barney.

165
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,189
Don't make us look like idiots.

166
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,368
"Don't make us look like idiots. "

167
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,071
- Bingo!
- What?

168
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,303
Zenas Beecham.
On the tax rolls of Grant County.

169
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:08,532
"Amtrak train number five
now arriving from Chicago..."

170
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,360
- Garret Smith?
- That's right.

171
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,434
Roy Yates. I'm the sheriff. I was asked
by the Denver PD to meet you.

172
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,004
- I appreciate it.
- Come this way.

173
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,973
Actually, they said
you were checking something unofficial.

174
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,611
- You a reporter?
- That's right.

175
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,681
Actually, they said they didn't even
know what it was you was checking.

176
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,547
I'm trying to find a man
named Zenas Beecham.

177
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,951
He owns property in this county.
You know him?

178
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,183
- What's he wanted for?
- He's not wanted.

179
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,821
But he might or might not know
about a Denver homicide.

180
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,956
I just wanna talk to him.

181
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:22,073
He's on the county tax rolls all right, but
his place, it's the ass end of the county.

182
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,765
- The benchlands.
- Benchlands?

183
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:29,277
Yeah, maybe 80 miles west of here.
Down there in the foothills.

184
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,574
You have any information on him?

185
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,583
- Does he have any sort of record?
- Nope.

186
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,154
Got a big family down there.

187
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,121
And a big farm. About all I know.

188
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,887
- Other Mormons out there?
- Mormons?

189
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,054
Is that what this is all about?

190
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:51,794
- All I'm asking is that you point the way.
- How do you plan to get out there?

191
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,770
- Rent a car, I guess.
- Not in this town.

192
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,965
Ain't any here to rent.

193
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,136
- Maybe I could use one of yours.
- Nope.

194
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:07,080
All the Denver PD asked me to do
was to meet you, which I done.

195
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,317
"- Pleasure meeting you, Mr Smith.
- Where's the Beacon?"

196
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,050
"- Uh... what?
- Your weekly paper, the Beacon."

197
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,558
Oh, it's up the street there.

198
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:34,240
- You can't be Garret Smith.
- I can't?

199
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,007
He wouldn't be caught dead
in a town like this.

200
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,912
I was born in a town like this.

201
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,676
What can I do for you, Mr Smith?

202
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:47,791
I thought! could rent a car up here,
but that was a mistake. I need a car.

203
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,756
- I'll drive you.
- You will?

204
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,989
Yes, and I won't even ask
what you're working on.

205
00:28:56,634 --> 00:29:01,333
- How long have you had this newspaper?
- For years. My husband and I started it.

206
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,602
And then when he died
I just kept it going myself.

207
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,073
The one thing I can't do
is go to the police about Willis.

208
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,235
Not before I hear Zenas's side of it,
anyway.

209
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:46,145
- What makes you think he'll talk to you?
- He'll have to. It's in his own interests.

210
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:51,983
You're lucky. You wound up
with one of the few people he will talk to.

211
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,719
I'm not much of a Mormon,
but I happen to be a cousin of Zenas's.

212
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,227
You're kidding!

213
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,763
That's what happens
with multiple marriages.

214
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,958
Everybody's a cousin.

215
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:05,062
Cousin Zenas!
It's me, Jastra. Jastra Watson.

216
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,896
- Ezra's daughter.
- Right. The one with the newspaper.

217
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,538
- Who is this?
- My name is Garret Smith.

218
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,600
A Gentile?

219
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,108
Worse. I'm a reporter.

220
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,238
I can vouch for him, Zenas.
And he has some things to tell you.

221
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:29,750
- Some terrible things.
- About the murder of Orville's family.

222
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,386
- You heard.
- It was you who told me.

223
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,719
I told you?

224
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,794
<i>In the Denver Tribune.</i>

225
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,760
Oh. I didn't know
our paper was read down here.

226
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,927
We're just finishing our dinner.
Will you join us?

227
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,732
- That's very kind.
- Thanks. But I'd like to wash up first.

228
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,898
I'll show you where.

229
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,424
Mr Smith. Please.

230
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,274
Mr Smith, this is my wife Rebecca.

231
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,875
And Esther and Florinda and Ursula,
her sisters.

232
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,244
- Welcome to our home, Mr Smith.
- Thank you.

233
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,783
- Welcome.
- And you.

234
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,286
- Cousin Jastra.
- Thank you.

235
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,332
<i>Thank you, Father.</i>

236
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,991
Praise the Lord. Amen.

237
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,977
- Drink it.
- What is it?

238
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,606
Peach juice.
And have some bread and dunk.

239
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:13,485
- Have some what?
- A biscuit which you dip into the broncos.

240
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,990
It's red plum sauce.

241
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,391
The red plums grow wild here,
so they call them broncos.

242
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,466
You're wondering
if I'm married to all four of them.

243
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,510
No, the only thing I'm wondering about
is if you killed your nephew's family.

244
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,874
Only one person could accuse me of that.
You've seen my brother Willis?

245
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,988
Yes.

246
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,955
Has it occurred to you
that it was Willis who killed them?

247
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,389
His own grandchildren?

248
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,653
There are some, Mr Smith, who believe

249
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:59,360
that the only fortunate people are the ones
who have atoned for their sins in blood.

250
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:07,637
Are you saying that if Willis killed those
children, he was doing them a favour?

251
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,144
In his doctrine.

252
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,849
That angel back there.
What does that angel represent?

253
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:23,289
When my father broke with the
compromisers, the Salt Lake theocracy,

254
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,091
he chose the avenging angel
as his symbol.

255
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,993
OK, but on the question of killing,

256
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:37,162
doing people a favour, saving their souls,

257
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,034
killing them to save them...

258
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,379
Is that also your doctrine?

259
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
I think, Cousin Jastra,

260
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,255
you and your friend had better go now.

261
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,757
As you say, Zenas.

262
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,727
Thanks for your hospitality.

263
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,529
It's Cain and Abel, but which is which?

264
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,962
I keep kicking it around in my head.

265
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,728
Do you think Orville could have done it?

266
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,565
He'd have to be
the greatest actor in the world.

267
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,470
But it's crazy. It's crazy.

268
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,111
This idea of murdering people
to save them.

269
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,578
That's nothing new.
It's what the Inquisition was.

270
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,276
- Did you know their father?
- No, he was before my time.

271
00:35:55,453 --> 00:36:00,220
But I did know Zenas and Willis
hated each other. I mean hated.

272
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,532
I'd think water would be the one thing
they wouldn't have to truck in.

273
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,796
It's serious. Take the shale people.

274
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:18,431
Do you know how much water they use
to make one barrel of oil?

275
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,409
- How much?
- Nearly six barrels of water.

276
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,741
"If you wrote that up,
I'd sell it to the Tribune for you."

277
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,820
- You'd do that?
- Sure. It's interesting.

278
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,670
That son of a bitch!

279
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,112
I have a feeling
I'll be exploiting you further.

280
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,310
Any time.

281
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,952
I meant it when I said
I'd help you sell your articles.

282
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,151
I know you did. And I appreciate it.

283
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,356
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

284
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,101
Ah! The media!

285
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,300
At last!

286
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,339
- Sorry we're late.
- No problem. No problem.

287
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,382
Let me introduce you around. Come.

288
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,545
Chief Doyle you know.
And this is Mrs Doyle.

289
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,692
We've never met,
but I do feel like I know you.

290
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,054
- Everyone does.
- Thank you.

291
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,220
This is Mr and Mrs Pike.
Miss Fabrizio and Mr Garret Smith.

292
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,593
- Mr Smith.
- A pleasure.

293
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,201
Don't let her looks fool you.
She is a barracuda.

294
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,271
Flattery will get you nowhere, Homer.

295
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,898
This is Miss Lucy Bigelow,
the most philanthropic woman in Denver.

296
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,738
- Miss Fabrizio...
- How do you do?

297
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,346
Shit. We're gonna have to wait
till you have a drink.

298
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,607
- Oh, no, please...
- Why don't we...

299
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,777
"5 table, tout le monde!
Vite, vite, mes enfants! Let's eat."

300
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:29,498
I know it's a low profit margin, Lucy,
but I think it's undervalued at 150.

301
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,727
- Anything new on the massacre, Chief?
- Not really, Garr.

302
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:37,237
- Hey, come on, Barney, what's the latest?
- We're working on it.

303
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:43,142
You don't expect us to back you
if you won't even tell us secrets, do you?

304
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,148
Well, Garr here's the one with the secrets.

305
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,946
Is that true, Mr Smith?

306
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:55,559
Go on. You've been running around the
country on it. What have you found out?

307
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,253
Do you really want me
to talk about this in public, Chief?

308
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,367
- You write about it in public.
- Yeah, I guess! do.

309
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:10,633
In the last couple of days I met...
talked to two very interesting men.

310
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,799
They're brothers.

311
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,744
One of them is Willis Beecham,
who's a fundamentalist Mormon preacher.

312
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,076
The other one is Zenas Beecham.

313
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,277
He owns a big farm.

314
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:27,117
According to Willis,
his brother Zenas did the killing.

315
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,418
According to Zenas, it was Willis.

316
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,585
Either one of them could have done it.

317
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,665
The one thing they have in common
is a very crazy doctrine.

318
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,598
Blood atonement.

319
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,239
- Oh, you know about it?
- I read a book about it once.

320
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,777
This massacre has brought
these two brothers to the point

321
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,472
where they really mean to kill each other.

322
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,244
- Sounds like the perfect solution.
- What?

323
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,021
What do you care
if two crazies kill each other?

324
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,753
Well, I care. And if you expect to be
elected mayor, you'd better care too.

325
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:09,195
She's right, Barney. If you don't solve
this case, you won't be dog-catcher.

326
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:14,497
Now, wait a minute.
I'm Denver. I got no authority out there.

327
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,663
Shall we all move into the living room?

328
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,277
- Can't you talk to the governor about it?
- I suppose I can.

329
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:24,244
Garr, give me a memo on this, will you?
Who they are, where they live.

330
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:28,647
We have a problem with time here.
Can't we call the governor now?

331
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:35,949
Look, we don't need the governor. If you
want the state police, I'll get 'em for you.

332
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:41,288
- Now, anyone care for brandy?
- I would, thank you.

333
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:48,468
Anybody here know of an outfit
called the Colorado Water Company?

334
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,332
- What do you want to know?
- Who owns it?

335
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,875
<i>I do.</i>

336
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,775
- You do?
- You gave it to me for Christmas, darling.

337
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:03,017
He's the most generous husband
I've ever had.

338
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,475
No! Surprise is of the essence.

339
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,669
If we're in too many vehicles,
we'll attract attention.

340
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,979
Your purpose, if you will.

341
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,993
Whatever it is that brings you back,
Mr Smith, this is a house of worship.

342
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,860
I didn't come here
to bring any trouble to you.

343
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,336
Gentile policemen with guns?

344
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,667
You seem to have a few yourself.
New way of worshiping?

345
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:06,976
How we worship is no concern of yours,
nor any concern of the law.

346
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,515
We are a temple of the Lord.

347
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:15,682
Really, Mr Beecham,
they're only here to keep the peace.

348
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,626
I didn't think you'd be so quick
to get your vengeance.

349
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,825
I did not speak of vengeance.

350
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,200
Come on, Orville,
your father spelled it out for me.

351
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:33,207
He blames Zenas,
and you're all on your way there now.

352
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,241
It is no affair of yours.

353
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,146
No affair of yours... Agh!

354
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,771
You've killed him.

355
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,850
"- The Lord is with him.
- The Lord is with him."

356
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:21,152
<i>Please, Lord, take him unto you.</i>

357
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,920
Please, Lord, take him unto you.

358
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,998
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

359
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:35,127
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

360
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,569
It wasn't really your fault, I guess.

361
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,167
He did have a bad heart.

362
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,812
- When's the funeral?
- Tomorrow.

363
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:48,244
What time?

364
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,149
Nine in the morning,
but you will not be welcome.

365
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,880
I'd like to be there.

366
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,830
- No point in our staying now, is there?
- I guess not.

367
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,733
I'm gonna hang around.
I wanna go to the funeral tomorrow.

368
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,897
OK.

369
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,944
<i>Oh, how great the goodness of our God,</i>

370
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,915
who prepareth the way for our escape

371
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,215
from the grasp of that awful monster.

372
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:30,258
Yea, that monster, death and hell,

373
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,622
which I call the death of the body

374
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,124
and also the death of the spirit.

375
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:45,438
And because of the way of deliverance
of our God, the holy one of Israel,

376
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:52,072
this death of which I have spoken,
which is the temporal,

377
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,810
shall deliver up its dead,

378
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:58,045
which death is the grave.

379
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,588
"- Amen.
- Amen."

380
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:06,321
- And this death of which I have spoken...
- Where are all the men?

381
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,488
...shall deliver up its dead,

382
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:13,500
which spiritual death is hell.

383
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:19,966
Wherefore death and hell
must deliver up their dead

384
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:24,103
and hell must deliver up its captive spirits

385
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,149
and the grave must deliver up
its captive bodies

386
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,388
and the bodies and the spirits of men
will be res...

387
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,809
They got the jump on me.
They're on their way.

388
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,678
Ask your sheriff to watch out for them.
Head them off.

389
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,546
Well, I can try.

390
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,088
There's no way I can catch them by car,
so I've hired a pilot and a plane.

391
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,055
"I'll be there in an hour.
You think you can meet me?"

392
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,218
"- Sure thing.
- Thanks."

393
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,112
You sure do get around!

394
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,588
- Talk to the sheriff?
- Yeah, but I got nowhere.

395
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,355
He wasn't gonna send anybody out
looking for some crazies with no crime.

396
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,521
And only the word of a nosy reporter?

397
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,328
Oh, yeah,
a nosy reporter from the big city.

398
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:32,035
Maybe I should have borrowed your car
and driven myself.

399
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,145
- It could get ugly down there.
- You mean no place for a woman.

400
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,771
Except of course
Zenas's women and kids.

401
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,284
I appreciate your concern, but
we're going there to stop a fight, right?

402
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,046
If I can.

403
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,285
I tried to talk the state police
into meeting me there.

404
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,454
They said I was only guessing
what Willis Beecham might do.

405
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,993
<i>Zenas!</i>

406
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,638
Cousin Zenas!

407
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,298
I know you don't want us here,
but listen, please.

408
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,968
Willis is on his way. He means to kill you
and all of your family.

409
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,341
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

410
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,040
He left last night.
He should be here any time now.

411
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,252
You two cover the barn.

412
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,590
There's a good spot right over there, Jebb,
by the trees.

413
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,477
I'm grateful to you. For the warning.

414
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:21,105
- Zenas, you ought to get outta here.
- We can handle it.

415
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,779
Not without casualties, you can't.

416
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,644
Women and children
will stay together inside.

417
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:57,810
I want all the men outside,
and boys over 12.

418
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,979
Well, go!

419
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,222
Zenas, you should have taken the offer,
cleared out of here.

420
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,626
Willis would have found us
wherever we went.

421
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,229
Into the house and stay down!

422
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,654
Away from the window!

423
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,830
- Somebody offer to buy this place?
- For years.

424
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,352
- Who's trying to buy it?
- The water company.

425
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,785
Whatever they offered, I refused to sell.

426
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,551
This is sacred land.
My father's land.

427
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,921
The Colorado Water Company?

428
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,487
They want our water.
We are on a lake of artesian water.

429
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,500
Jonathan!

430
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,669
Over 12, Jonathan. Over 12.

431
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,805
- Give me that.
- Let me borrow this.

432
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:50,299
Hold your fire, Zenas.
I have an idea.

433
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,202
<i>Hold your fire, men!</i>

434
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,037
<i>Willis!</i>

435
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,735
Willis!

436
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,880
Willis!

437
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,040
It's that newspaperman from Denver.

438
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,049
Willis!

439
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,018
What do you want, Mr Smith?

440
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,126
I think we should talk.

441
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,285
I'm not here to talk.

442
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,795
Zenas agrees to a truce while we talk.

443
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,161
What have you got to lose, Willis?

444
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:33,566
- Let's hear him out.
- I'm coming down!

445
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,399
First let's set something straight.

446
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,502
Zenas, did you kill Orville's family?

447
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,339
I swear by everything I hold dear,

448
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,008
by our father's memory,

449
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:21,185
I did not order or commit such a crime.

450
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,219
- Did you kill them, Willis?
- Of course not.

451
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,692
You killed my father!

452
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:02,126
No! Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

453
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,485
There's someone coming.

454
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,723
Did you see those suckers
killing each other?

455
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,099
Looks like that newspaperman.
Let's get the hell outta here.

456
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,764
Listen, I think we've been recognised
by that newspaperman.

457
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,923
<i>Why don't you take care of him?</i>

458
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,559
He's a newspaperman.
We gotta make it look like an accident.

459
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,401
"- What's he driving?
- A green and white Blazer."

460
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,738
"- OK, we'll take care of it.
- Yeah."

461
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,944
Children, you are at prayer.

462
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,940
<i>The police will move now.</i>

463
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:43,313
Are you sure
those men up there were professionals?

464
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:47,923
Yeah. Paid assassins. Probably
the same men that did the massacre.

465
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:52,016
- Of Orville's family?
- Probably. Just look at it.

466
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,154
If you wanted to buy Zenas's land
and Zenas didn't want to sell

467
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,495
and you knew that Zenas and his brother
were having a blood feud,

468
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,263
you would provoke the brother.

469
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:06,501
I'm gonna get those bastards!
Those killers!

470
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:14,379
I'm gonna get the ones who make the
decisions, the ones who are responsible.

471
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,851
You'll be writing your own version
of the story, just as I will.

472
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,992
Let's not mention the gunmen
until I've talked to the police.

473
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,684
<i>Right.</i>

474
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,640
Move, you bastard! Move!

475
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,514
<i>What is he doing? Oh, my...</i>

476
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,555
Oh, my God! He's right on us!

477
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,845
Damn!

478
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,152
They're going to kill us.

479
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,471
Oh, my God!

480
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:43,085
"On 106. 7 KAZY, Denver's home
of rock 'n' roll, this is Andy Shone."

481
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:49,528
"We have lots of concerts coming to town.
Call the KAZY concert line on 759-8989."

482
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,690
Gotcha.

483
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,635
That was the lab.
The casing's from a 30-06.

484
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,468
But we don't have the bullet itself,
like you said.

485
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,633
Did you talk to the coroner?

486
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,939
What passes for a coroner down there.
The undertaker.

487
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,514
No bullet in Zenas's body, he says.

488
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:11,210
You were right.
Must have gone right through him.

489
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,514
- Any luck with the mug shots?
- Nope.

490
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,680
<i>Yeah?</i>

491
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,793
"- Foxx is here, Chief.
- Send him in."

492
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,695
- Mr Foxx.
- How are you, sir?

493
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,864
- Good to see you, Homer.
- Chief.

494
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,577
The reason I asked you down
is Garr here's got some questions.

495
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,977
- Questions? For me?
- Yeah.

496
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,481
About Trudy and Cyrus Pike.

497
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,485
Oh. What would you like to know?

498
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:50,490
The other night at dinner, I was asking
about the Colorado Water Company.

499
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,685
- And who owned it.
- She does.

500
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,194
He gave it to her as a Christmas present.

501
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,925
That's what she told me.
For the woman who has everything.

502
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:03,405
- Does she actually run that company?
- What do you mean?

503
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:08,375
Does she know that much about it?
Managers, operating officers?

504
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,876
I have no idea. Why don't you ask her?

505
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:16,644
He wanted to. I'm the one thought it might
be a good idea to get your opinion.

506
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,256
I'd like to talk to her.
I'd like to talk to both of them.

507
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,257
No problem. I invite you all to lunch.

508
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,418
- Sure they won't mind?
- I don't see why.

509
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,587
Well, I mind.

510
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:34,760
We are talking about a bunch of people
who own half the state of Colorado.

511
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,030
People who are backing me.

512
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,700
I'm not gonna embarrass them by asking
them a bunch of damn fool questions.

513
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,574
It's all right, Chief,
you don't have to come.

514
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:56,251
I can't tell you how very impressed we've
been with the way you handled that story.

515
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,724
- Thank you.
- That's what journalism's really about.

516
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,024
Not just reporting events
but digging into them.

517
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,463
<i>Why don't we run him for mayor?</i>

518
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,729
Better still, why don't we buy the paper?
He can be editor.

519
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,438
- Would you like that, Mr Smith?
- You would be publisher?

520
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,974
But I wouldn't interfere at all.

521
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,610
That's sort of what I wanted to talk about.

522
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:24,446
Just how much do you involve yourself in
the operation of running your companies?

523
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,751
- That depends on the company.
- Colorado Water Company, for instance?

524
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,988
- Why do you ask, Mr Smith?
- Well, he asked me, and I thought...

525
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:40,567
- Is that the purpose for this luncheon?
- I suggested it because...

526
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,931
Yes, sir. It is the purpose.

527
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,975
There are some things
I left out of that story.

528
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:51,739
Anyway, there's another element
that was in that fight down there,

529
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,246
and I haven't got it puzzled out yet.

530
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,408
I thought maybe you could help me.

531
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:01,648
You see, Zenas's property is smack-dab
on top of a large lake of artesian water.

532
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,125
The Colorado Water Company
has been trying to buy it for years.

533
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,230
But Zenas wouldn't sell.

534
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:14,062
And I have a question in my mind
about whether you two knew about this.

535
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:17,296
- I didn't. Did you, darling?
- No.

536
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,102
Didn't you say something to me
when we were discussing that shale deal?

537
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,268
Listen, Homer.

538
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:28,406
I do not appreciate you inviting us for
what was supposed to be a social lunch...

539
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,417
Excuse me, sir.
It's my fault. I asked.

540
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:35,148
But if you'd rather not talk
about that subject, we'll drop it.

541
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,815
"- I apologise.
- I don't understand."

542
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:43,557
Even if the company was trying to buy the
place, what's it got to do with the feud?

543
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:49,604
Nothing, probably. But there's
something else I left out of the story.

544
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:50,898
0h?

545
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,477
Some tanker trucks that belonged
to the Colorado Water Company

546
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,635
made a real effort to kill me.

547
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,714
You're not suggesting
we had anything to do with that?

548
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,976
Oh, no, of course not.

549
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,679
I thought you might tell me
which of your executives I could talk to.

550
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,881
I'll certainly look into this.

551
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,252
Thank you.

552
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,056
Mr Smith, there's a phone call for you.

553
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,097
- Shall I bring you the phone?
- No, I'll go there. Thanks.

554
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:20,168
Excuse me a moment.

555
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,544
Yes?

556
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,878
I have information for you.
The Beecham case.

557
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,246
You know how many calls I get like this?

558
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:41,389
Shall I tell you what you saw
on the wall up at Orville's place?

559
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:47,157
"- Yeah. What did I see?
- An avenging angel."

560
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,789
A sketch of an avenging angel.

561
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:54,232
- Who is this?
- Shall I tell you what you saw at Zenas's?

562
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,198
"- Up on the knoll.
- What?"

563
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,672
One gunman. One driver.

564
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,777
Who the hell is this?

565
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,176
Do we meet?

566
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,555
You said you wanted to talk.

567
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,719
Go ahead.

568
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,424
I'm not talking into that.

569
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,560
If this is a trap...

570
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:09,075
You picked the place. If there's anybody
lurking about, you brought them.

571
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,944
All right. Here's the deal.

572
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,109
I didn't kill anybody.

573
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,287
At Orville's place I was just a lookout.

574
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,222
At Zenas's place I was just a driver.

575
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,919
OK. So?

576
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,166
So I sell you the story.

577
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,292
For $50,000.

578
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,201
I give you the name of the guy
that did the killings.

579
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,435
You don't print it, you don't go
to the police until I'm out of the country.

580
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,903
That's the deal.

581
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,040
$50,000.

582
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,080
I'm gonna have to ask my editor
for the OK.

583
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,781
But I also have a price.

584
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:03,220
- Yeah?
- The name of the person that hired you.

585
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,259
- I told you. The killer hired me.
- Who hired the killer?

586
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,802
- I have no idea.
- No deal.

587
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,133
It was that bastard's contact.

588
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:16,100
He's the only one who can tell you.

589
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,708
OK. I'll call my editor.

590
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:28,423
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

591
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,987
How do I know
you're not gonna call the police?

592
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,186
You trust me or you don't.

593
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:11,058
Oh, I guess he'll go to Mexico
or someplace else.

594
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,389
OK, I'll tell him.

595
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:26,314
I want you to know, Orville,
I'm still working on that story.

596
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,447
I'm gonna find
the ones responsible for this.

597
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,821
Will that bring them back?

598
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:38,121
No, but the ones responsible
must be punished.

599
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,996
You're a good man, Mr Smith.

600
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:47,608
But I've been standing here talking with
the Lord. Do you know what he told me?

601
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:50,939
That it is not up to me
to question his wisdom.

602
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,241
It is not up to me to avenge myself

603
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,375
or for you to do it for me.

604
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,812
He has angels for that.

605
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:01,180
"Come on down.
I hope you brought some money."

606
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,649
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Nice to see you again, Homer.

607
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,946
Join us.

608
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,679
Lucy, I hope
you've brought your chequebook.

609
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:13,760
If you do as much for the Symphony
as you do for this policeman of yours...

610
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:16,591
- Let's get him elected!
- I can't drink on the job.

611
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,496
She won't let me drink at home.
This is the only chance I get!

612
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,227
Then we'll talk about it.

613
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:27,899
- Trudy, Cyrus, good to see you.
- Ah! Just the man I want to talk to.

614
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:36,010
Ah, Smith and Fabrizio!
Late again but very welcome.

615
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:40,245
Grab yourselves a drink.
We're just about to start.

616
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,317
Ah! It's themselves!

617
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,486
Hail to the Chief!

618
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:50,189
- Big night, isn't it?
- Yes, very exciting.

619
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:57,197
"I think we should have a drink
for this young lady here. Thank you."

620
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,835
I'm about to wrap up my story
on the massacre.

621
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,539
Do you have any news
from the state police?

622
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,749
You still on that kick
about the Colorado Water Company?

623
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,356
It's not a kick, Chief.

624
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,526
- You know who it is?
- I have my suspicions.

625
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:40,809
OK, Jimmy, here's your refill.
Give me a little maestro music, please.

626
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,416
<i>That's great!</i>

627
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:48,215
Folks! Folks! Let me have your attention
over here, please.

628
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:54,225
Nobody can claim they were invited here
under false pretences.

629
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,854
We need money.
We need a lot of money.

630
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:02,662
The reason we need it is we want to elect
a good guy to the office of mayor.

631
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,897
There he is. Mr Barney Doyle.

632
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,268
Come out here, Barney.

633
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,145
That's it, Barney. Let's hear it!

634
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,452
"- A fine mayor!
- All right!"

635
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,954
I'll try to be brief,

636
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:28,426
which is not easy for a politician.

637
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:36,129
Now, a question
I think all of you have a right to ask is:

638
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,829
Why would a guy with a good job,

639
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,733
and chief of police is a good job,

640
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,173
why would he want to be mayor?

641
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,336
Well...

642
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:54,778
A cop has to concentrate
on being against things.

643
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:59,154
Fighting crime, catching the bad guys.

644
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:04,421
Somebody's gotta do it, but it's dirty work.

645
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,198
Now, you take a mayor.

646
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,134
He gets to accent the positive.

647
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,833
He gets to build things.

648
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:21,142
He gets to build
a cleaner, healthier, wealthier,

649
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:25,184
wiser and happier city.

650
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,990
Hell, I like the idea.

651
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,131
Well, that's about it, folks. Thank you.

652
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,199
All right! Excuse me.

653
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,072
All right! All right, folks!

654
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,478
Now, I want you to do something for me.

655
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,210
I want you to visit the buffets,
stuff yourselves,

656
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,377
get drunk, covet your neighbours' wives.

657
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,217
Make some big deals
and have a hell of a good time!

658
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,383
Some of us are gonna pass among you
with outstretched hands,

659
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:09,359
and I want some big cheques
in those hands!

660
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,762
You're on your own, Barney. Thank you.

661
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:18,905
- Can you get away?
- I'll try. He's getting suspicious.

662
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:24,376
Smith, I've got some incredible news
for you, about Cyrus Pike.

663
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,343
Cyrus and I have made a deal.

664
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,347
I'll give as much to Doyle
as he gives to the Symphony.

665
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:32,213
Very good, Lucy.
Thank you so much. Wonderful.

666
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:40,150
- It's a pleasure to make this contribution.
- Thanks, Ed. This is most generous.

667
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:43,764
- Here's my contribution, Homer.
- Thank you very much.

668
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:47,663
We can't talk here. My study
is just upstairs. Can we meet there?

669
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:50,202
- Sure.
- All right.

670
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:59,103
Judge! Thank you, thank you.
You'll get a receipt, I promise.

671
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,873
Thank you.

672
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,040
- Ladies, how's it going?
- Fine.

673
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:17,187
Well done. I'm sure you're gonna win
a lot of votes from that one.

674
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,525
Thanks, Jo.

675
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,602
- You must be so proud of him.
- Oh, yes. He's a good man.

676
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:13,118
You got the best of me last time we met,
but not this time, huh?

677
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,247
What the hell are you doing?

678
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,588
Big-time reporter like you
and you don't know what I'm doing.

679
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:23,663
You don't know what I'm doing, huh?

680
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,631
You just caught a burglar red-handed.
What's a burglar to do?

681
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,035
Goodbye.

682
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,286
Bastard child- killer!

683
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:02,436
I'm gonna take you downstairs and you'll
name the son of a bitch that's paying you.

684
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,446
Listen. You understand?

685
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:22,852
You name the son of a bitch
or I'm gonna beat you to death.

686
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,002
- You're gonna give us the name, yes?
- No!

687
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:53,176
"- Let the chief deal with it.
- Ohh!"

688
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:59,482
I had enough. I had enough.
Oh, yes. I had enough.

689
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:04,924
Yes. Yes.

690
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,932
What the hell's going on, Garr?

691
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:20,840
This is the man who killed Orville's family.
He's gonna tell us who paid him to do it.

692
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,341
Sorry, Mr Foxx.

693
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,739
He's the one.

694
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:00,816
He paid me to kill that family.

695
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:05,225
That's ridiculous!
What are you saying?

696
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,763
He's lying. Why?

697
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,966
I don't...

698
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:25,635
I don't know anything about this. What...

699
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,507
What the hell
would I have to gain from this?

700
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:32,746
When I acquired his shale company,
I merged it with my water company.

701
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,446
- I gave him an option to buy it back.
- No.

702
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:39,024
The combined company.
For what it was worth at the time.

703
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:44,525
It would be worth millions.

704
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:49,059
Barney.

705
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,263
I haven't killed anyone.

706
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:56,308
No, you just pay someone like him
to do your killing for you.

707
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:00,805
That's the way I have to write it.

708
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,476
That is a lie and you are a liar.

709
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,485
You're a fucking liar!

710
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,953
Liars! That's all lies!

711
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,891
It's lies. It's all lies.

712
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:19,289
It's lies.

713
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,895
And you, my friend.

714
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:27,770
Oh... Oh, you're a liar.
You are a liar, my friend.

715
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,734
Why did you say
those bad things about me?

716
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:35,906
Why couldn't you
just keep your mouth shut? God!

717
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:38,683
Plead! Pray!

718
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,084
Beg!

719
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:46,021
Pray, you bastard!

720
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:50,931
God... have mercy!
