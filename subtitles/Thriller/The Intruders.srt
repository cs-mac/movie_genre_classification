2
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,085
Please, no, please.

3
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,580
Yeah, no, it wasn't too bad.

4
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,749
We didn't even hit any bad weather
until the Midwest.

5
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:47,291
I'm excited, it was competitive,
but they got my design.

6
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,748
We're incredibly lucky. We got a nice house.

7
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,331
So, like it?

8
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,415
I like our old house.

9
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,830
Why is this furniture here?

10
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,040
Previous owners left it behind.

11
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,748
We're going to get rid of it
once our stuff arrives.

12
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,205
It's only temporary.

13
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,539
I always wanted to restore an old house.

14
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:06,205
Come here, I want to show you something.

15
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,706
These are the original plans.

16
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,497
This thing was built in 1912.

17
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,871
I thought that maybe
that would be your bedroom,

18
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,371
second door on the right.

19
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:28,496
Like, they added this wall here
to house the central air duct

20
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,413
for a completely inefficient use of space.

21
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,538
I thought we'd open it up and restore it
to its original layout, what do you think?

22
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,039
You couldn't find a crappy
remodel closerto home?

23
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,996
Come on.
A change of scenery is a good thing.

24
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,748
Not always.

25
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:45,497
Okay, don't judge the kitchen!

26
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,747
I've got someone working
on the water damage.

27
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:59,246
And then we're gonna gut this stuff.

28
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,247
We're gonna get new countertops, cabinets,

29
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,539
but I'm gonna wait for stuff
to settle down at work first.

30
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,996
Which will be never.

31
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:07,829
Speak of the devil.

32
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,746
Yeah, hey, it's Jerry.

33
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,997


34
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,203
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

35
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:27,495
<i>I sure would.</i>

36
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,201
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

37
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,077
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

38
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,827
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

39
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,827
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

40
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:29,786
Hey.

41
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:34,036
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

42
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,326
We just moved in across the street.

43
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,285
I'm Rose.

44
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:44,826
Leila.

45
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,950
Hey, Leila.

46
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,327
Are you all right?

47
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:54,911
My dad is, like, unreal, I can't even tell you.

48
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:59,826
Me and my dad, we argue all the time.

49
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,825
I mean,
obviously I don't know your situation.

50
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,451
But I'm sure it's gonna be okay.

51
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:11,200
See, that's the thing, it's not gonna be okay.

52
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:15,700
Yeah, he can't erase everything he did.

53
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:16,909
She's gone

54
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,993
and she's not coming back.

55
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:21,909
Ever.

56
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,742
What's your deal anyway?

57
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:30,242
Nothing, like I said, we just moved here.

58
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:33,617
Honestly, how can you live in that house?

59
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,367
Honey, let's get in the house now, okay?

60
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,450
Come on.

61
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,283
Come on.

62
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:13,533
She said she doesn't understand
how we could live here.

63
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,533
- What do you mean?
- In this house.

64
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,576
Why would she say that?

65
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,740
Did something happen here?

66
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:24,074
No, nothing happened here.

67
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,658
This is a great house, give it time,
it'll be home before you know it.

68
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:38,866
I had your prescription
transferred over to the local pharmacy,

69
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,865
so let me know when it's time for a refill.

70
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,615
I don't want to be on medication any more.

71
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:03,240
Rose, we've been over this.

72
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,740
So, I thought maybe this week
we could take a cruise,

73
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:13,157
check out some local campuses,
University of Chicago, Northwestern...

74
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,449
I'm going back to Stanford.

75
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:25,864
Your mom loved this city,
she talked about it all the time.

76
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,447
She loved the people, the music.

77
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,697
She loved everything about the place.

78
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,905
The lakefront, the
museums, she hated

79
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,907
baseball but loved
Wrigley Field,

80
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,574
Buckingham Fountain all lit up at night.

81
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,406
It's beautiful.

82
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah, I remember the pictures.

83
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,949
Tomorrow why don't we check it out?

84
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,823
Would you like that?

85
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,822
Damn, looks like
I have to go into work tomorrow.

86
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:26,820
Shocker.

87
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,695


88
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,528


89
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,070
Don't come near me!

90
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,403
Christ, whoa. Time out, Jesus.

91
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,362
Who the hell are you
and what are you doing in my house?

92
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:33,319
I'm Noah, Noah Henry,
I'm part of the construction crew.

93
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,361
We were hired to work on your house,
that's why I have keys.

94
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,570
We left a bunch of tools downstairs,
somebody must've moved them.

95
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:41,736
There was a scraping sound.
What was that, was it you?

96
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,778
That was the guys outside
pulling off the gutters.

97
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:45,713
Sounded like the walls were caving in.

98
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,402
Well they wrap around the entire house

99
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:51,029
and they're filled with ice and snow,
dead leaves, all kinds of gnarly stuff.

100
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,153
That's why you're getting
this water damage inside.

101
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,070
Why is it so quiet now?

102
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:02,609
Maybe they got the first side down already?

103
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,735
God, I'm so sorry. Let me get you some ice.

104
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,693
My dad didn't tell me you were coming today.

105
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:23,486
Yeah. No, the contractors weren't ready
for us on anotherjob so we swung by here.

106
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,778
We didn't think anybody was home.

107
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,403
Here.

108
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,361
Thanks.

109
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,236
Does it hurt?

110
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,319
Only when I breathe.

111
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:39,611
I'm kidding. Kind of, sort of. Not really.

112
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,069
So, are you going to be here all day?

113
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,944
I wish.
Got a few more houses we need to hit up.

114
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,235
- Well, I should probably...
- Absolutely.

115
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:57,861
Only, I didn't catch your name?

116
00:17:58,403 --> 00:17:59,818
It's Rose.

117
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,318
All right, well, don't forget to lock up
before you leave.

118
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,694
All right, Rosy Rose.

119
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,735
Just Rose.

120
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:14,194
Sorry again for the intrusion.

121
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,235
What the hell?

122
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,817
- Hello?
- Hey.

123
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,650
<i>How's it going?</i>

124
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:27,233
<i>I just have a few things to finish up
and then I'll be heading home.</i>

125
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:28,609
When?

126
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,607
I'm just asking 'cause I'm making dinner.

127
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:33,691
<i>That sounds good. I'm not sure.</i>

128
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,108
<i>Not long, I'll call you from the car.</i>

129
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,607
Okay, hurry home.

130
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,899
Your mom burnt plenty of dinners
when she first started cooking.

131
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:26,106
I turned it off, I told you.

132
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:29,149
Maybe you turned it up by accident instead.

133
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:32,607
Yeah, or maybe
if you didn't stay at work all night

134
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,397
we could actually eat when dinner's ready.

135
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,397
I'm sorry, I'll call next time. I promise.

136
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,357
Do what you want,
I'm not even supposed to be here.

137
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,689
I should be away at school.

138
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:47,524
Rose, the administration suggested strongly
that you take a leave of absence.

139
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:22,273
Hey.

140
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,606
What are you doing here?

141
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,064
Is Leila home?

142
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:44,021
You two seem about the same age,
I hope that's where the similarities stop.

143
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,438
You seem like a very smart girl.

144
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,438
I should be going home.

145
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,980
Stay out of trouble, you hear?

146
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,312
Rose, have you seen
those blueprints for the house?

147
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:01,855
The ones I showed you?

148
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:03,479
- What?
-For the house?

149
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:05,104
No, I haven't seen 'em.

150
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,813
That is so weird,
things don't just go missing.

151
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,353
Will you keep an eye out?
I have to submit 'em to the city.

152
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,271
What's that?

153
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:16,647
I found it in the neighbours' driveway
across the street.

154
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:19,855
What were you doing in their driveway?

155
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,897
I haven't seen his daughter
since he caught us talking.

156
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:26,563
What if... I don't know,
what if something happened to her?

157
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,438
Just forget it.

158
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,395
Is the modem hooked up?

159
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,186
No, it's not working, but I'll call tomorrow.

160
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,771
Help me.

161
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:46,644
Let me out!

162
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:54,850
Please help me,

163
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,434
let me out!

164
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,851
Help me!

165
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:38,393
...the building, it's elegant, it's simple,
it's really sound.

166
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:43,099
Just a simple beam construction.
What you don't see are the caissons.

167
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,642
Go down 180 feet into the ground so...

168
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,016
Will you excuse me for a second?

169
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,726
Would you mind waiting in my office
forjust a minute? Thank you.

170
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,558
Hey.

171
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:01,058
Rose, what are you doing here?

172
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:03,933
- Something's happening in the house.
- What are you talking about?

173
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,433
Something. I don't know,
strange things keep happening.

174
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,682
How did you get all the way down here?

175
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,558
I flagged a cab in the street.

176
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:14,433
All the way here? How did you pay?

177
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:18,016
I didn't, you took my credit card,
I don't have anything.

178
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,891
He's waiting downstairs.

179
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:21,808
Oh, my God, look at you.
You must be freezing.

180
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,349
What are you thinking? This isn't California.
Where's yourjacket?

181
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,142
All right look, when this meeting is done
I'll take the rest of the day off.

182
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,806
Here, give this to the cab driver.

183
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,558
Actually, on second thought,
just stay here, don't move,

184
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,350
I'll be right back. I'll take care of it, okay?

185
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:52,056


186
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:55,682


187
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:58,598


188
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:01,642
<i>The last person to see Rachel
was Howard Markby,</i>

189
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,516
<i>a neighbour of Mrs Garrison.</i>

190
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:19,806


191
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,390
<i>Howard Markby, formerly a prime suspect</i>

192
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,056
<i>in the disappearance
of 20-year-old Rachel Winacott,</i>

193
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,224
<i>has been vindicated by police.</i>

194
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:28,432
Winacott was a
houseguest staying

195
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,348
with Cheri Garrison
of 340 Laura...

196
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:40,640
It was right here.

197
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,617
I found a doll head in my room.

198
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,805
Rachel wanted me to go up there.

199
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,141
That's why she knocked over
Mom's recipe box.

200
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,055
She wanted me to go upstairs
and see what Howard Markby was doing.

201
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,680
And then today
I found my phone in the drawer

202
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,141
'cause she wanted me to find the doll head.

203
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,014
Look.

204
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:11,849
I don't understand,
it was easier to read before.

205
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:16,141
But, here's the R and the A.

206
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,267
Here's the W.

207
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:20,555
Do you see it?

208
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,224
"Rachel was here."

209
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,766
To be honest, I don't.

210
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,140
But even if I could,
didn't a girl named Rachel live here?

211
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:33,140
- Wouldn't it make sense if she...
- Something bad happened to her.

212
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:36,597
What about the door slamming shut?
I couldn't get out.

213
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:38,931
It's an old house.

214
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,847
It has quirks.

215
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,721
Why couldn't I get out then?

216
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,140
It was like someone was
pushing on it from the other side.

217
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:53,888
It's stuck a little.

218
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:59,930
It happens with wood, expands, contracts.

219
00:32:03,472 --> 00:32:04,931
Don't look at me like that.

220
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,889
The necklace.

221
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:11,473
Howard Markby
was the main suspect for a reason.

222
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,804
Yeah, the police ended the investigation,

223
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:16,722
but why was he a suspect in the first place?

224
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:19,204
Did you call about the Internet?

225
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:21,639
Yes, they sent someone by earlier today.
It should be working.

226
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:40,888


227
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:50,803
Is that what you were
looking for downstairs?

228
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,139
There.

229
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,639
There, now do you see?

230
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:00,889
How did this get back up here?
Explain that to me!

231
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,015
Rose.

232
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:03,803
No, I can't stay in this house.

233
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,014
I want to stay at a hotel.

234
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,013
- That's not gonna happen.
- I feel like I'm a prisoner here!

235
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,137
I don't know anyone,

236
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,804
I'm 20 years old and I can't even access
my own bank account without your consent!

237
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:15,513
- I'm just doing what's best for you!
- No, you're doing what's best for you.

238
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:16,802
I'm doing what's best for us!

239
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:18,721
This is not my imagination!

240
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:22,637
I'm not some crazy person,
it's not my emotions running wild!

241
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,720
- I'm not Mom!
- That is enough! That's enough!

242
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,845
I want you to be honest with me.

243
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,678
Are you taking your meds?

244
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:51,220
Yes.

245
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,638
I think we should call Dr Turner,

246
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,718
get a referral for someone local,
someone good.

247
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,553
I don't need a psychiatrist!

248
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:08,762
I just... I'm tired.

249
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,012
I haven't been sleeping well.
Plus the stress of moving.

250
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:17,386
You were right, I overreacted to everything.

251
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,762
But I'm fine now.

252
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:22,677
Really.

253
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,678
I swear.

254
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:48,427
Hey, where are you off to?

255
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,761
Coffee shop.

256
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:53,718
On foot? It's like three miles to town.
You don't have a car?

257
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,593
Or a winter coat?

258
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:01,386
Yeah, I'm still getting used to
this whole winter thing.

259
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,929
I should probably run back inside.

260
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:07,136
You mind if I wash my hands?
We were using this nasty epoxy stuff.

261
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:08,803
Yeah, come on.

262
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:10,844
So, how's the eye?

263
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:12,969
I'm hanging in there, thanks.

264
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,136
Stanford, huh?

265
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,887
Oh, yeah, I'm just...

266
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,718
I'm taking a semester off to figure things out.

267
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,718
How 'bout you?

268
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,301
Me? I'm working my way through school,
taking art classes in the city.

269
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:26,760
That's cool.

270
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:29,968
So, how's your boyfriend
coping with your absence?

271
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,426
No boyfriend.

272
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:34,802
Do you know Leila across the street?

273
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:36,719
Leila? Yeah, kind of.

274
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,468
We went to high school together,
she's a few years younger.

275
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:44,677
Her dad was accused of kidnapping
that girl who used to live here.

276
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,551
Yeah, it was big news for a minute

277
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:50,095
until the truth came out
about her moving away.

278
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:54,136
How do they know
that's what actually happened?

279
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:58,178
I guess there was an email saying she left,
not exactly sure.

280
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:02,053
Here's something I do know, you and me,
we should hang out.

281
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:04,970
Isn't that what we're doing?

282
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,926
No, I mean, like when I'm off the clock.

283
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,636
You should see me
out of these work clothes,

284
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:10,095
I'm a completely different person.

285
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,761
I bet.

286
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:15,970
Do you know why she was living here?
Rachel Winacott?

287
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,511
I guess Cheri Garrison
was trying to help her out,

288
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,260
she's always taking people in

289
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,801
and organising charity events,
that sort of thing.

290
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:25,427
She's like the saintly figure in our town.

291
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:26,511
She still lives here?

292
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,718
No, I heard she moved away.

293
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:31,385
Wonder why.

294
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,968
I'm gonna go grab a warmerjacket.

295
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,510
Great idea.

296
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:43,343
Think about what I said,
you and me hanging out.

297
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:53,508
Noah?

298
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:16,592
Noah?

299
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,133
Is that you?

300
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,048
- Dad!
- Rose!

301
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:56,675
- Dad!
- What's the matter?

302
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:57,842
I saw someone in the basement.

303
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,464
There's someone down there.

304
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,966
They're in the closet, I swear!

305
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:07,716
In the closet.

306
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:11,008
<i>He's 'm the comer 'gust standing there.</i>

307
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,633
I know what I saw.

308
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,508
I'm not making it up.

309
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:31,465
Look, I thought the change of environment
might be a good thing,

310
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,423
but obviously the move
has triggered something.

311
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:35,008
This isn't about Mom!

312
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:37,591
Howard Markby is hiding something,

313
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:40,383
he sent his daughter away the day after
he caught us talking. Why is that?

314
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:42,132
Rose, he did not send her away.

315
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:43,923
You're right, God only knows
what he did to her.

316
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:46,299
I just saw them together outside!

317
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,840
No. Where are you...
Rose, do not go out there!

318
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,841
Leila! Leila, we need to talk!

319
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,883
Rachel Winacott didn't move away.

320
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:11,633
He did something to her, didn't he?

321
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,339
Why was he a suspect?

322
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,339
What did he do to her?

323
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,841
He didn't do anything.

324
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:24,672
Rachel spent some time at our house,
so my dad was brought in for questioning.

325
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:28,132
A few days later Cheri got an email
from her son saying they ran off together.

326
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:31,589
No. That day you were out here crying,

327
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:35,882
you said that he caused a lot of pain,
that she was never coming back.

328
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:38,047
I was talking about my mom.

329
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,006
They separated and now she wants a divorce.

330
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:45,381
That's it, case closed, mystery solved.

331
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:49,091
- I'm so sorry, she's not well.
- No.

332
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,090
Where did you get that?

333
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,422
This necklace belonged to Rachel.

334
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:58,797
Yeah, she gave it to me for my birthday.

335
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:00,964
My dad and I got in a fight
because he thought it was from Kyle.

336
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:03,508
I got mad and I threw the necklace at him.

337
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:05,922
You saw it happen?

338
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:10,215
What, were you spying on us
from your window?

339
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,256
I saw you that night in the driveway,

340
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:15,757
with the garbage bag and the shovel.

341
00:40:16,923 --> 00:40:18,881
Yeah. So?

342
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,339
So?

343
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,465
I had a bag of gravel in the basement,

344
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:31,421
I brought it up and put it in my truck
with a shovel to gain some traction.

345
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:33,965
So don't come over here acting like
you know something about it,

346
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,716
'cause you don't.

347
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:37,422
I'm sorry.

348
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:40,339
- We're terribly sorry, we're sorry.
- Sorry.

349
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:41,797
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

350
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:45,840
See? lt'sjust in your mind.
It's like what the doctors say.

351
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:49,798
You find these things and you run with it.
They seem real, but...

352
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:07,921
Rose, the workers are here,
but they're in the basement,

353
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:10,297
I told 'em to keep it down.

354
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:15,797
I know this last year has been
really hard on you.

355
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:20,338
You have to try to move forward.

356
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:27,006
I won't be gone long.
Call if you need me, okay?

357
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:37,797
<i>I sure would.</i>

358
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,379
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

359
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,380
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

360
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:43,089
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

361
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,546
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

362
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,630
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

363
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,171
<i>I sure would.</i>

364
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:53,212
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

365
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:55,045
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

366
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:57,171
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

367
00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:59,920
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

368
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:43,961
You saw everything,
I must've looked like a total crazy person.

369
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,294
No, not at all.

370
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:48,754
Maybe my dad was right,

371
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:51,961
maybe the stress
from the move triggered something,

372
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:55,337
caused me to imagine things
that weren't really happening.

373
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,380
Are your folks split up?

374
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:00,880
Mine divorced a few years ago.

375
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:03,712
I'm staying with my dad for now
until I get my own place.

376
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:09,002
My parents aren't divorced.

377
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:11,504
My mom died nine months ago.

378
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,086
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

379
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:21,129
You know, after she died I kind of fell apart.

380
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:23,794
Well, yeah, of course.

381
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:28,418
It was bad. It was really bad.

382
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:35,878
My mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia
around the time I was born.

383
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:40,045
You know, when she was feeling good,
she was the best mom in the world.

384
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:41,960
She was so smart and funny.

385
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,794
She was an amazing cook.

386
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:47,504
But the medication, it changed her.

387
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,877
It just completely wiped her out.

388
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,085
I used to sit with her after school,
and I'd read to her, and we'd talk.

389
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:03,753
I did most of the talking,
but she always listened.

390
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:08,002
I mean, I get it.

391
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:10,209
I can see why she didn't like taking her pills,

392
00:44:10,293 --> 00:44:14,127
they just make you feel so numb
and disconnected from everything.

393
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,960
But to do what she did.

394
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:25,042
And not leave a note or anything.

395
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:29,169
That's something I'll never understand.

396
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,669
I was so mad at my dad
when he said we were moving.

397
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:37,168
I mean, all the memories
that we had in that house.

398
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,419
That's all we had left.

399
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:48,211
I'm never like this.

400
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,753
Why is it so easy to talk to you?

401
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,128
I've been told I'm a good listener.

402
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:02,418
We have orange juice, apple juice.

403
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:04,001
Water's fine.

404
00:45:09,753 --> 00:45:11,169
Glad I went with water.

405
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:15,168
I know it's gross,
but I'm the only one who drinks it.

406
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:18,752
I was kidding, kind of, sort of.

407
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,086
Not really?

408
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:22,792
So, I asked my dad about Cheri Garrison.

409
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:24,835
Yeah, what did he say?

410
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:31,544
Hey.

411
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:34,835
I just wanted to apologise
for freaking you out.

412
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,543
No, I'm sorry, it was totally me.

413
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,752
Anyway, I was gonna say
we should be friends, but...

414
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,501
I see you already found someone.

415
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,210
We were just talking about Cheri Garrison.

416
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:51,210
What do you want to know?

417
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:54,751
The other day you said you didn't know
how we could live here.

418
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:56,418
What'd you mean by that exactly?

419
00:45:56,668 --> 00:46:00,252
Hello, this place is beyond creepy.

420
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,584
Cheri left without saying a word to anyone.

421
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,667
No one even knew she was gone
for the longest time.

422
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:09,792
All her stuff was here,
and she had just disappeared... Like that.

423
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:16,292
And also, a few days before you moved in,
I heard yelling from in here.

424
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:17,877
I called 911, the cops came,

425
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,083
searched the entire house,
but there was nothing.

426
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:23,585
Well, how do you know
it was coming from in here?

427
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,708
Kyle heard it too, we were both
right outside on the stairs.

428
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:30,542
It definitely came from in here.

429
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,000
You got to wonder about somebody
who just skips out like that.

430
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,292
What was Cheri Garrison running from?

431
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,166
Yeah, or trying to hide.

432
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:42,751
Before you guys moved in,
your dad had us do some quick fixes.

433
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:47,667
In one of the bedrooms, the windows
were completely boarded up from the inside.

434
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:50,167
Here, I'll show you.

435
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,415
It was so effed up,
I had to take a picture of it.

436
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,500
The glass wasn't broken or anything.

437
00:46:57,501 --> 00:47:00,583
Why go through the trouble
of boarding it up?

438
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,125
Which room was that?

439
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,542
The second door on the right.

440
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:09,749
And, on the outside of the door,
was a heavy-duty padlock.

441
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,165
Whatever was inside that room
wasn't supposed to get out.

442
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,541
That doesn't prove anything.

443
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,540
I came over here to see Rachel,

444
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:28,624
she was so pale and anorexic looking.

445
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,167
Cheri said she was
going through withdrawal,

446
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:34,749
that's why she locked her up probably,
for her own good.

447
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:38,375
It's what they do with addicts sometimes,
till the symptoms pass.

448
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,874
Rachel was basically homeless,
Cheri gave her food and a place to stay.

449
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:47,126
Cheri Garrison is a good person.

450
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:51,665
I don't really know about her son, Marcus,
he was kind of quiet, shy.

451
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,165
I gotta grab something from the van.

452
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,749
Be right back.

453
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:03,789
So, are you two a thing?

454
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:06,915
What? No, we're just friends.

455
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:11,165
Come on, you two are beyond smitten.
It's so painfully obvious.

456
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,249
So, how old is Cheri's son?

457
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,291
A few years older than us, I guess.

458
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:21,290
He was home schooled, didn't get out of
the house much except for church.

459
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:24,331
Total choir boy. Like, literally.

460
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:26,748
That's why I was so surprised
when they ran off together.

461
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:27,915
Rachel and Marcus?

462
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,457
Yeah, what can I say? The girl has issues.

463
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:36,955
Anyway, I should probably get going,
I'm staying with my grandparents tonight.

464
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:43,663
I want to ask you something.

465
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,872
You know the blueprints
for the house are missing.

466
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:48,955
You think I took them.

467
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:50,788
I'm just asking.

468
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,749
You don't believe anything I say any more.

469
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:59,040
I have a question.

470
00:48:59,914 --> 00:49:01,332
When you bought this house

471
00:49:01,415 --> 00:49:03,289
did you know that the windows
in my room were boarded up

472
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,039
and that the door had a padlock on it?

473
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,664
What else do you know about this house
that you're not telling me?

474
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:51,288


475
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:53,497
<i>"The bitch finally let me out.</i>

476
00:50:53,747 --> 00:50:56,496
<i>"It's so dark and cold down there,
no food, no water.</i>

477
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:59,787
<i>"I have to find a way to leave
but she's always watching.</i>

478
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:02,454
<i>"My whole body aches, I feel so weak."</i>

479
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:18,166


480
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:20,121
<i>"Cheri, Marcus and Rachel."</i>

481
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,872


482
00:51:57,037 --> 00:52:00,078
<i>"Marcus stood up for me today,
he clearly has feelings for me</i>

483
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,535
<i>"but it's only making things worse
for both of us.</i>

484
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,997
<i>"I wonder how long
she'll keep him locked up."</i>

485
00:52:19,995 --> 00:52:24,120


486
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:39,120


487
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:13,328
Help me!

488
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,995
Help me!

489
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:04,451
You're gonna have a really hard time
convincing people, that's all.

490
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,535
Nobody's gonna believe
she did the things you're saying.

491
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:09,326
Well, once they realise it was all a lie.

492
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:12,952
It's like her charity was a way to cover up
what was actually happening in this house.

493
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:16,201
That's why she disappeared overnight,
she didn't want to get caught.

494
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:22,161
So, my friend Charlie's
having a hotel party tonight.

495
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:26,452
There's a great indoor pool,
guaranteed good times, you should come.

496
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,745
In fact, I insist.

497
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:31,869
You need to get out of the house,
meet some new people.

498
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:33,285
I'll pick you up at 8:00?

499
00:54:35,494 --> 00:54:36,702
Great.

500
00:54:36,785 --> 00:54:40,909
Only thing is I'm not supposed to
use the work van after hours,

501
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:43,076
I don't want your dad to see me driving it.

502
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,785
So is it cool if I pick you up
around the corner?

503
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:40,117
Yeah, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

504
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:41,992
I'm gonna bring a friend.

505
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:44,159
She's cool, she just moved here.

506
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,366
Rose?

507
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:28,656
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

508
00:56:28,824 --> 00:56:30,032
<i>I sure would.</i>

509
00:56:30,157 --> 00:56:31,866
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

510
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:33,907
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

511
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:35,492
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

512
00:56:36,282 --> 00:56:37,866
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

513
00:56:42,784 --> 00:56:44,491
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

514
00:56:44,574 --> 00:56:46,074
<i>Rose'?
-l sure would.</i>

515
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:47,824
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

516
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:50,074
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

517
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,574
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

518
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:18,781
Hey, sorry I'm late. Did you get my text?

519
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,405
No, I couldn't find my phone.

520
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:24,156
No way.
You've been out here this whole time?

521
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,905
I'm so sorry,
I got stuck at home helping my mom.

522
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:29,031
She wouldn't let me leave.

523
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:30,823
Didn't you say you lived with your dad?

524
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,906
Oh, yeah. No, no.
I stopped by my mom's for dinner.

525
00:57:36,948 --> 00:57:39,199
You look pretty, by the way.

526
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:40,406
Thanks.

527
00:57:55,657 --> 00:57:56,823
Thanks.

528
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:58,531
Here you go.

529
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,946
I'm glad you came tonight.

530
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:05,824
So, I was wondering.

531
00:58:05,907 --> 00:58:08,738
You said you kind of
fell apart after your mom.

532
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:10,280
What happened exactly?

533
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:13,072
If you're comfortable telling me.

534
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:14,947
Let down your wall, girl.

535
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:22,573
Remember when I said I'm taking
some time off to figure things out?

536
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:25,949
Well, I didn't really have a say in the matter.

537
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:29,616
Truth is, after my mom died,
I wound up in the hospital.

538
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:32,449
My dad probably thinks I'm exactly like her.

539
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:35,489
My doctor even said the episode I had
was brought on by stress.

540
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,656
Not mental illness or anything like that.

541
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:44,322
Why do you want to know all this stuff?

542
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,198
'Cause I like you.

543
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:53,490
People, this is a party.

544
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:56,322
If you're not adding value, you're out, huh?

545
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:57,905
Yeah!

546
00:59:00,114 --> 00:59:01,490
Can we do this?

547
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,240
Yeah, let's do it.

548
01:01:19,235 --> 01:01:20,611
Sorry, I haven't.

549
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:23,738
Rose! Have you seen Leila?

550
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,069
Not since the other day.

551
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:28,152
She said she was going
to her grandparents' house.

552
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:32,527
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

553
01:01:33,028 --> 01:01:34,653
Hello?

554
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:36,944
Is everything all right?

555
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:40,944
I haven't heard from her since last night,
and she's not answering her phone, so...

556
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:45,651
If you hear from her
would you let me know, please?

557
01:01:46,109 --> 01:01:47,319
Yeah.

558
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:49,527
Thanks.

559
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:51,195
Okay.

560
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,361
This is very helpful.

561
01:01:57,569 --> 01:01:59,486
Yeah. Thank you, Dr Turner.

562
01:01:59,861 --> 01:02:01,526
Okay, I will.

563
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,194
Okay.

564
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:07,902
Why were you talking to her?

565
01:02:07,986 --> 01:02:10,237
She was giving me your referral.

566
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:15,736
Something's happening in this house
whether you choose to believe it or not.

567
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,527
Rose, I can't do this right now.

568
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:20,569
Do you see this?
I have a huge presentation, I have to focus.

569
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,068
You never have time for anything but work.

570
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:24,445
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!

571
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:27,526
When Mom got really sick,
I was the one nearby her bedside every night

572
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,360
while you stayed at work late.

573
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:32,068
That's how you handle anything
involving actual human emotion.

574
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:36,652
I felt so alone after she killed herself,
I had nobody.

575
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:39,360
Did you ever stop to think about that?

576
01:02:39,651 --> 01:02:41,735
Did you ever stop to think about this?

577
01:02:41,818 --> 01:02:44,735
You're not the only one who lost somebody.

578
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:49,943
Yeah, just keep popping your pills
to numb the pain.

579
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,776
I'll be fine on my own.

580
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:50,276
Rose, is that you?

581
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:53,276
I'm so sorry I said what I said to you.

582
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,984
Oh, my God.

583
01:04:03,651 --> 01:04:05,941
I came in here and it was like this.

584
01:04:07,984 --> 01:04:08,984
I didn't do this.

585
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:11,151
- Just get out, please. Just go.
- Dad, I swear.

586
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:12,442
Go!

587
01:04:12,692 --> 01:04:13,901
Get out!

588
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:20,025
<i>Maybe you were so upset
you don't remember doing it.</i>

589
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,523
No, that's not what happened.

590
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:25,150
Something in this house
is trying to communicate with me.

591
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:27,526
It's absolutely happening.

592
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:29,442
And now Leila is missing.

593
01:04:29,692 --> 01:04:31,691
She's probably off with Kyle somewhere.

594
01:04:31,858 --> 01:04:33,400
Kind of like Rachel and Marcus?

595
01:04:34,026 --> 01:04:38,318
Marcus was trying to protect Rachel,
and things went too far.

596
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,858
Cheri did something awful to them,
that's why she left town.

597
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,068
Rose, you can't bring her back.

598
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,858
No, but I can at least try to figure out
what happened to her.

599
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,775
That's not who I'm talking about.

600
01:04:54,984 --> 01:04:58,566
You suffered a major loss, it's your mom.

601
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,233
There's nothing worse than that.

602
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:05,898
Your pain, it's starting
to come out in other ways.

603
01:05:05,983 --> 01:05:07,484
Don't you see?

604
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:12,067
You sound just like my dad.

605
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:14,941
Why, 'cause I'm worried about you?

606
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:16,400
Where are you going?

607
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:19,483
Look, just 'cause we kissed
doesn't mean we're together, okay?

608
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,442
You're not my boyfriend.

609
01:05:21,524 --> 01:05:25,566
So, is this your thing?
Someone gets too close, you shut 'em out?

610
01:05:25,899 --> 01:05:27,525
- Give me the keys.
- What?

611
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:29,192
Now!

612
01:05:29,274 --> 01:05:32,649
I don't want you coming
in and out as you please!

613
01:05:35,774 --> 01:05:37,358
- Now get out!
- Rose, I have a job...

614
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,773
Out!

615
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:43,399
Can we please talk about this?

616
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,357
There's nothing to talk about.

617
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:50,148
You're right, I'm not well.
Let's just leave it at that.

618
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:00,984
Hi, the lady upstairs directed me to you.

619
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:04,399
I'm looking for the original blueprints
to our house.

620
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,984
We don't usually get
too many young people down here.

621
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:11,606
Yeah, my dad misplaced his copy,
so I'm just trying to help him out.

622
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:15,690
Well, blueprints are generally filed
with the corresponding building permit.

623
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,774
Can you give me the name
of the previous owner?

624
01:06:17,942 --> 01:06:20,897
- Yeah, Garrison.
- Just a second.

625
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,608
Garrison, Garrison.

626
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:29,647
Watch your step.

627
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:34,107
Cheri Garrison, 340 Laura.

628
01:06:42,814 --> 01:06:44,481
Got it.

629
01:07:04,523 --> 01:07:05,981
Dad?

630
01:07:38,982 --> 01:07:40,189
Hello?

631
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,857
My phone's about to die, can you hold on?

632
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:46,107
I need to get my phone charger. Hello?

633
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,022
Shit.

634
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:30,270
Rose! Rose!

635
01:09:32,937 --> 01:09:35,313
Rose? Rose?

636
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:37,104
Rose?

637
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:40,644
Breathing's back to normal,
heart rate is good.

638
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:42,644
Right now she just needs some rest.

639
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:45,437
Are any prescription pain medications
kept in the house?

640
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,353
Like hydrocodone, oxycodone?

641
01:09:47,478 --> 01:09:51,061
Yeah. I'm on pain meds,
I had back surgery last year.

642
01:09:51,686 --> 01:09:53,979
I'm asking you this
because your daughter's symptoms

643
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,686
are consistent with this type of misuse.

644
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:40,518
Hey.

645
01:10:41,895 --> 01:10:43,312
How do you feel?

646
01:10:44,394 --> 01:10:46,018
What are you doing?

647
01:10:46,268 --> 01:10:47,936
I made you some soup.

648
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:58,644
When was the last time
you took one of these?

649
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:01,144
Why didn't you tell me that you ran out?

650
01:11:04,517 --> 01:11:06,061
I forgot.

651
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,685
Are you trying to hurt yourself?

652
01:11:16,269 --> 01:11:18,602
How many of my pills did you take?

653
01:11:19,852 --> 01:11:21,769
I never touched your pills.

654
01:11:23,685 --> 01:11:26,604
Rose, the paramedic said
your symptoms were consistent

655
01:11:26,645 --> 01:11:28,560
with an overdose of hydrocodone.

656
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:30,728
That's impossible.

657
01:11:33,143 --> 01:11:34,560
And you believe them?

658
01:11:41,435 --> 01:11:43,768
I left some water for you right there.

659
01:11:43,852 --> 01:11:46,768
Do you want anything? Juice? Tea?

660
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:51,894
Wait, yesterday when I came home
I had some juice.

661
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:53,767
I remember it tasted funny.

662
01:11:54,016 --> 01:11:56,226
Right afterwards
that's when I started feeling dizzy.

663
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:58,018
Are you saying you were drugged?

664
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:06,602
I don't know what I'm saying.

665
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:34,727


666
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:31,099
<i>Hey, it's Jerry.</i>

667
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,600
Just call me back
as soon as you get this, please.

668
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:29,514
Stop, stop, I don't want to hurt you.

669
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,096
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.

670
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:35,347
So don't make me.

671
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:46,013
What do you want from me?

672
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:55,389
I want you to put on the dress.

673
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,723
My dad's gonna be home any minute.

674
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:03,014
We both know that isn't true.

675
01:17:03,889 --> 01:17:05,638
Don't lie.

676
01:17:10,847 --> 01:17:12,222
No!

677
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:18,388
Stop crying!

678
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:22,054
People get hurt when they cry.

679
01:17:35,387 --> 01:17:36,805
Why are you doing this?

680
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,097
'Cause it's so much fun!

681
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,597
Just kidding.

682
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:49,848
It's been you the whole time.

683
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:51,555
I get to keep you.

684
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:55,929
You should be glad, Rachel wasn't so lucky.

685
01:18:02,054 --> 01:18:05,597
My mother didn't agree with our relationship.

686
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,428
She made me do it.

687
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:14,346
She made me do all kinds of things.

688
01:18:15,346 --> 01:18:17,263
God's good intention.

689
01:18:17,846 --> 01:18:20,720
She said,

690
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:24,804
the almighty hand of the Lord!
Put on the dress!

691
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:33,555
I never hurt my mother
or fought with her before Rachel.

692
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,262
You and me, we're the same.

693
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:43,347
We both lost our mothers,
and that's what brought us together.

694
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,094
That was Rachel's dress.

695
01:18:57,136 --> 01:19:00,262
I'm so glad that you
wanted to know what happened to her.

696
01:19:00,346 --> 01:19:01,470
Rachel's the reason.

697
01:19:01,552 --> 01:19:04,846
The reason that I ended up
in this house all by myself.

698
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:15,469
I don't want to hide any more.

699
01:19:35,095 --> 01:19:37,761
You're even more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

700
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:43,719
It's okay.

701
01:19:44,428 --> 01:19:46,220
I'm nervous too.

702
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:14,344
No!

703
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:22,051
No!

704
01:20:56,426 --> 01:20:59,301


705
01:21:56,508 --> 01:21:58,177
I like this game.

706
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:01,093
I like this game so much.

707
01:22:25,427 --> 01:22:26,633
He'll hear you.

708
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,051
- He'll hear you.
- Where are you, Rosy Rose?

709
01:22:29,217 --> 01:22:31,094
Where are you, my sweet?

710
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,509
Rosy Rose.

711
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:40,133
Okay.

712
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:42,757
Rosy Rose?

713
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:07,467
Have I found my true one?

714
01:23:09,549 --> 01:23:10,633
Have I?

715
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:30,423
You're being awfully quiet!

716
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:40,839
I'll come back for you.

717
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:56,671
Dad!

718
01:24:57,798 --> 01:24:59,172
Dad!

719
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:01,173
Dad!

720
01:25:02,547 --> 01:25:03,547
No!

721
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,214
It's not supposed to be like this, Rose!

722
01:25:09,255 --> 01:25:11,881
Stop, you're not like the others.

723
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:14,172
Stop it!

724
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,465
Rose, Rose!

725
01:25:21,547 --> 01:25:24,423
Are you okay? Rose. Rose, are you okay?

726
01:25:24,922 --> 01:25:26,297
Rose.

727
01:25:28,298 --> 01:25:29,464
No, stop!

728
01:25:31,297 --> 01:25:32,380
No!

729
01:25:32,547 --> 01:25:34,298
Marcus, stop!

730
01:25:44,965 --> 01:25:46,213
Like I said...

731
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,255
You're prettier than I imagined.

732
01:26:07,297 --> 01:26:08,841
Dad!

733
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:12,755
Help me.

734
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:24,462
Well, it's not much,
but at least our stuff has arrived.

735
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,544
Anything's better
than that hotel for another month.

736
01:27:27,627 --> 01:27:29,545
Well, maybe not anything.

737
01:27:30,462 --> 01:27:32,879
But, this is exactly what I wanted.

738
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:35,837
No musty basement, no creepy attic.

739
01:27:37,212 --> 01:27:39,129
We're getting new appliances next week.

740
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:41,379
It already feels like a home.

741
01:27:42,503 --> 01:27:44,046
Thanks again for helping out.

742
01:27:44,129 --> 01:27:46,295
Glad I could be of service.

743
01:27:46,545 --> 01:27:48,672
So, your first day of school tomorrow.

744
01:27:48,714 --> 01:27:51,713
It's not Stanford,
but Northwestern ain't too shabby either.

745
01:27:52,004 --> 01:27:53,004
You nervous?

746
01:27:53,045 --> 01:27:54,087
No.

747
01:27:54,378 --> 01:27:56,545
Maybe there will be
some cute guys in my classes.

748
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:59,004
Be careful, your boyfriend might get jealous.

749
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:01,837
- He's got nothing to worry about.
- Really?

750
01:28:03,087 --> 01:28:04,378
Come on.

751
01:28:04,403 --> 01:32:04,403
