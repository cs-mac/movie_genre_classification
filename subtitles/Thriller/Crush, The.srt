<i>[Episode 19]</i>

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,690
You do this, and ta da.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,100
What is this?
Are you serious?

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,800
Is he crazy?

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
When did you get here?

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,100
Who are you?
You don't seem like the doctor in charge.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,290
I'm the doctor in charge
of the patients' rooms.

10
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,200
Yi Ryung looked so bored by herself,
so I took her out for some air.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,390
Oh, and my aunt needed to
go back to the store.

12
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,000
She did?

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,290
You're not cold?

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,200
She should be okay,
I already gave her my cardigan.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,720
It's not a cold day,
but it's still better to be safe.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,100
Is that what this was for?

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
Thank you.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,730
Thanks to you, she's warm and I'm warm.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
It's very good.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,090
I didn't know you had a brother.

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,640
- Oh, that's--
- What brother?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,290
If you mean a close relationship
where we could start dating...

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,820
then that is possible.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,700
To simplify it...

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
she's someone
I'm sort of raising.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
We are totally not related

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,290
and this could turn into
any kind of relationship.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
I thought I saw you somewhere. You're...

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,900
If you're a resident right now,
then who is your professor?

30
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,400
Professor Song Ae Joo.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Professor Song.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Professor Song and I work out together.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,700
I wonder if she's still
working out these days.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,700
- Yes, she is.
- I should give her a call.

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,200
Since you say you're in charge
of our Yi Ryung

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I should find out
what kind of person you are.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,500
That's not very necessary for you to do.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Why?

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,300
Maybe you're using
your position as a doctor

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,090
to get closer to your patients.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,400
Maybe you're not working
during work hours

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,690
and are hanging out with your patients.

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,540
Maybe you're not doing your research
and looking into photosynthesizing.

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,190
I should find out about all of this.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>[High End Crush]</i>

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,490
What does it mean
that you're "raising me"?

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,190
It's true, I am raising you.

48
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,690
You used to sleep and eat under my roof.

49
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,000
I was there in the
emergency room for you

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
and I took you
to a patient room.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Then I stayed with you
until your aunt got here.

52
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,900
Don't you think all of this
is equivalent to raising?

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,190
You know that all of this
doesn't mean the same thing.

54
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,190
I don't know what you were thinking

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,000
but to me, it means the same thing...

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
- Are you mad?
- Why do you keep asking me that?

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,500
You constantly look angry.

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Are you annoyed
because I called you so late at night?

59
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,400
- What are you talking about?
- You're not looking at me.

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,190
I'm not mad at you.

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,190
I like you being dependent on me.

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,900
I would have preferred if you didn't
call me just because of the hospital.

63
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,800
What I hate...

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,590
is that when I stand in front of you...

65
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,000
I become sensitive and petty.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,690
You don't know anything.

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,930
I used to despise girls who were cunning.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I think a little differently these days.

69
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,990
I prefer girls who
actually understand me.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I know exactly what they're thinking.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
But I don't have a clue with you.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,500
When can you get discharged?

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
They're going to run more tests tomorrow
and I'll get discharged the day after.

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
When is your aunt coming?

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,390
She is going to be here tomorrow again.

76
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,600
But my fever went down
and I'm not that sick anymore

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,300
so she doesn't necessarily need to come.

78
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,190
Until then...

79
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,450
don't talk to him even if you're bored.

80
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,800
What?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
He likes you.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
He has other intentions...

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,070
and he might take it the wrong way
if you keep talking to him.

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
What are you talking about?
He's just a doctor.

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Are doctors not men?

86
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,100
Can you just listen to me when I talk?

87
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,000
You have to say things that make sense
in order for me to listen!

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Why would he like me when
we just met today for the first time?

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,190
I don't know what the reason is

90
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,000
but it only takes two seconds
to decide if you like a person or not!

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,890
Just because you're like that,
is everyone else the same way?

92
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,300
Yes, everyone is like that.
Everyone does that!

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
What do you know about men?
You don't know anything.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,500
Men are humans too,
what wouldn't I know?

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
We're all the same.

96
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,100
You don't even know what my feelings are.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,690
So how do you feel?

98
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,790
These are my feelings towards you.

99
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,190
I told you.

100
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,690
I did this much...

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You're still going to act
like you don't know?

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you want me to
wet some towels for you?

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
It's okay.

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to work?

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,890
Are you okay?

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,190
I actually feel better.

107
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,300
Since you did everything you could,
you shouldn't have many regrets.

108
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,500
You got smacked by the girl you like,
risked your life hiking

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,000
provided her with a house,
bought her flowers, dinner, and clothes.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,840
You tried to make her jealous,
you went to visit her in the hospital

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
and you still try
to hold on to her dearly.

112
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,300
You don't even need to really date her.

113
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,500
You did everything you could
for two people who didn't even date.

114
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,800
This is the most high end crush
that I've ever seen.

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,300
Perfect!

116
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,000
I can even feel
the difference in class...

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
It's high end, it's perfect,
and unbelievable!

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,690
I just can't believe it!

119
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,100
I'm awed by your innocent feelings.

120
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,390
Jeez!

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Are you done?

122
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Are you sure you don't have
anything else to say?

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,190
You're going to do more?
People don't do more than this.

124
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,000
They do what they can,
then stop around here.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why? Because not everyone climbs up
to the top of Mount Everest.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,190
You did this much,
I doubt anyone saw that coming.

127
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,500
Oh, seriously!

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,600
You just need to sign one more thing.

129
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,890
Get out.

130
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,690
Control your temper.

131
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>There is nothing we can do
since the hospital bill was already paid.</i>

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,100
<i>We can take care of it</i>

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,600
<i>if you bring in the person
who paid for the bill but...</i>

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
<i>[CEO Choi Sae Hoon]</i>

135
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,130
No, no, no, no.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,790
<i>Hello, this is Yoo Yi Ryung.</i>

137
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,360
<i>I'm getting discharged today,
and regarding the hospital bills...</i>

138
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,000
Hello?

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
<i>Why don't you call me?</i>

140
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,200
Who is she?

141
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
She's good.

142
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,200
She's a new singer.

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,500
<i>Choi Sae Hoon is definitely good.</i>

144
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,790
I wasn't too sure
if it would work, but it did!

145
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,600
Oh, this guy!

146
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
I'm going to get her
no matter what.

147
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,290
How is Choi Sae Hoon these days?

148
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,000
There are no words about him
signing a contract with her.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Do you think he might have given up?

150
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,100
No, that's not possible.

151
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,290
He's the type to never give up.

152
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,200
It's better for us...

153
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,790
because if we bring her in...

154
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,790
Choi Sae Hoon will die from
his aggravation.

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,430
What's wrong? What happened, huh?

156
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,500
Drink this.

157
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,290
I broke up with my boyfriend.

158
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,390
You had a boyfriend?

159
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,890
Who doesn't have a boyfriend these days?

160
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
He said he can't trust me.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,540
He said he doesn't even know
if I like him or not.

162
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,790
He's crazy, how would he know how I feel?

163
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,700
He should just believe me
when I say I do.

164
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not easy saying that to someone.

165
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,500
Because I like you.

166
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,120
You just need to give me a chance.

167
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,290
He's asking me why I like him
when he's just average.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
How would I know
how things ended up this way?

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,200
I didn't want it to end this way,
but it already happened, what can I do?

170
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,840
These are my feelings towards you.

171
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,640
I did this much...

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're still going to act
like you don't know?

173
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,000
He's saying I'm too much for him.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm so speechless.

175
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,290
If that's so, he should be
thankful and good to me.

176
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,290
But instead, he breaks up with me?

177
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,000
<i>If by any chance...</i>

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
any slightest, slightest chance,
I like you...

179
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
then it's like winning the lotto for you!

180
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,110
It's better than winning
the lotto 10 times!

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,130
You're very pretty,
I can understand why he's doing this.

182
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,100
He said we are too different.

183
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,700
There are no two people
who are exactly alike in this world!

184
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
He used to say that we had so many
things in common in the beginning.

185
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
He said all that just to hit on me.

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
I think people recognize you.

187
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,000
Wipe off your tears.

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,790
How can they
when I'm crying with my hat on?

189
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,100
They recognize you.

190
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,600
Me?

191
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
You keep running away
from the shoot, right?

192
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Did something happen between you two?

193
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,890
Do you want me to give you a ride?

194
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,200
No.

195
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,890
Are you still sick...

196
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,600
You look fine now. I'm glad.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Thanks to you.

198
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Oh, the hospital bill...

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,700
I have to go.

200
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Take care of yourself.

201
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
You still look a little sick.

202
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,700
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

203
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Think about it.

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
I like you...

205
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,290
and I don't think I'll change...

206
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,600
at least for now. No...

207
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,790
I don't think I can change.

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,890
At least for now?

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,890
You don't expect me to like you
for the rest of my life, right?

210
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,390
I might.

211
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,390
But if you tell me
that you don't like me...

212
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,100
then I'm going to try
not to be like this.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't wait too long,
so think about it quickly.

214
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,290
If you want to do this,
then you come to me.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,100
If it's possible...
the earlier, the better.
