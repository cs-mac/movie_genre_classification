00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,716
What?

164
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,352
Dori thinks
she's your girlfriend.

165
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,855
I guarantee that she's
telling all her gal pals

166
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,325
about how her great new
boyfriend is so special

167
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:24,029
and she maybe
has found Mr. Right

168
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,363
Dori's not like that.

169
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,098
She's well travelled.

170
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,833
International.

171
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,268
I've never said
anything to indicate that

172
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,970
this relationship
is serious.

173
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,705
You said you'd
go away with her.

174
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,273
That's saying it.

175
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,212
Seriously? There is a
coffee maker over there.

176
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,114
We don't have soy.

177
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,152
Look. Some people
like to lease cars

178
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,386
and some people
like to buy them.

179
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,388
And my lease with Dori
is up in a few weeks.

180
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
I wash my hands
clean of all this.

181
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,459
Oh shit, I forgot
to call Cara.

182
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,732
Are those really real?

183
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,301
So now do you think I should
give up like you did?

184
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,869
I didn't think so.

185
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,271
Hey... I'm a
happily married man.

186
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,305
Really?

187
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,807
Are you really
happily married?

188
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,709
Because I have never met
a happily married couple.

the top of that list.

Cara!

191
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,815
Hi!

192
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,817
You did?

193
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,952
That is so funny.

194
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
You're wrong.

195
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,422
about the coffee.

It's so romantic.

My heart is floating.

202
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,020
I'm surprised such
an expensive car

203
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,287
doesn't have one of
these things built into it.

204
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,124
It's not a car.
It's a Porsche.

205
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,292
That is so
typical of a man.

I'm reading this book

211
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,902
called 'The Twelve Steps
to a Happy New Year.'

212
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,003
Of course you are.

213
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,304
What?

214
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,273
He's a really
smart guy.

215
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,342
Dr. Fisher says that 'Men
have a more difficult time

216
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,144
expressing their emotions
than women do.'

217
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,380
You mean we don't
cry all the time.

218
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,483
I can try and make
you cry if you want?

219
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,888
So rather than expressing
their emotions to a person,

220
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,289
they'll express them
to something else.

221
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,425
A sports team,
a stereo...

222
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,160
A car...

223
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,163
Something that
can't respond back.

224
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,331
So it's a woman's responsibility
in a relationship

225
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,802
to show the man how to get
in touch with his emotions.

226
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,073
Dr. Fisher calls it
"Guerrilla Training."

227
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,374
It's a really good book.

228
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,309
Okay.

229
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,812
Norman, relax.

230

You have nothing to
worry about with me.

00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,311
Wait up.

236
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,487
You gotta see this.

237
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,133
See what?

238
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,501
Shh.

239
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,236
Isn't it beautiful?

240
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,404
Look at it.

241
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,840
Yeah.

242
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,209
When I was little
I used to

243
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,880
imagine that...

244
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,916
all my fears were
in the belly of the sun

245
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,018
and when the sun
would finally go down,

246
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,121
my fears would
go down with it.

247
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,591
Do you know what
I was afraid of?

248
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,393
No.

249
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,495
Being alone.

250
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,416
I love this place.

251
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,884
I used to come
here for the summer

252
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,553
with my
Grandpa Ed.

253
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,022
He has a soft serve ice
cream machine out in back

254
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,491
and we would sit
on the front porch

255
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,295
and eat ice cream
cones all day.

256
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,430
What's your flavor?

257
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,998
Ohh, I don't know.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Mint chip, maybe.

259
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,203
You don't look like
a mint chipper.

260
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,004
What am I then?

261
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,174
You're more of a Pralines
and Cream type person.

262
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,944
Pralines
and Cream...

263
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,412
I think they're sexy.

264
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,081
It's not bad.

265
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,184
Rub your fingers
through my hair.

266
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,490
That feels good.

267
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,129
Do you know
what today is?

268
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,332

269
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,533

00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,269
It's our anniversary.

00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,505
Our anniversary?

272
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,541
It was two months ago
today that you hired me.

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,211
And as I recall, just three
days later that you...

274
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,346
...fired me.

275
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,581
And fire you I did.
Twice.

276
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,218
You violated some
federal labor law I think.

277
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,321
I think I violated
more than that.

278
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,960
Two whole months!

279

you've found your mate.

282
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,004
Really?

283
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,705
Yup.

284
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,041
And if you can survive

count, though.

293
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,364
It's late.
We should?

294
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,000
How do you feel?

295
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,735
I feel?

296
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,139
a little bloated
from the pasta...

297
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm not really
an Alfredo guy.

298
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,710
No. I mean about me?
About us?

299
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,151
You feel our
connection, right?

300
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,286
You know, it's hard for me
to think that I'd be here

301
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,689
if we didn't have
some sort of connection.

302
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,757
Yeah. Some feeling,
somewhere. Right?

303
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,295
I mean, we have fun together
and you make me laugh.

304
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,396
Make you laugh?

305
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,231
Yeah.
You make me laugh.

306
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,334
Is that so wrong?
Is that so bad?

307
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,370
Make you laugh how?

308
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,707
I dunno.
Like 'Hardy har har.'

309
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,343
Well then laugh it up,
Mr. Backer! Laugh it up!

310

I'll show you who's

00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,415
What's so funny now?

313
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,086
I'll teach you
to mess with me.

I can't believe
I just said that.

You're not going
to say it back?

We've had
a lot to drink.

323

Ah come on,
where are you going?

324
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,494
I shouldn't
have said it!

325
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,096
I'm such an idiot!

00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,432
Listen,
you're over reacting.

327
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,134
It's no big deal
that you said that.

328
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,268
No big deal?

329
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,636
A woman tells you
that she loves you

330
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,837
and you say
it's "no big deal"?

331
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,708
Listen, I'm just saying
I'm alright with you saying it.

332
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm okay
that you said it.

333
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,147
So you're okay
that I love you?

334
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,785
If you're okay with it
and just having a hard time

335
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,186
telling me, that's okay.

336
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,288
I can help you.

337
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,260
I want you to look deep within
yourself when I ask you this.

338
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,695
Okay?

339
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,531
Do you love me?

340
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,802
Come on...

341
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,804
Oh my God!
What is my problem?

342
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,405
Why do I keep doing
this to myself?

343
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,406
Why?!
You know what?

344
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,507
Forget what I said
about loving you.

345
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,576
Forget it!

346
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,144
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed!

347
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,913
Dori, let's not get
all crazy, alright?

348
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,681
Your bedroom is upstairs,
down the hall!

349
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,885
The sheets are in the wash!
Happy anniversary, asshole!

350
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,462
Holy fucking shit.

351
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,525
Wakey wakey,
eggs and bakey.

352
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,561
Did you sleep okay?

353
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,596
Yeah, I suppose.
Considering.

354
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,632
Sorry, you won't find any
reception way out here.

355
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,468
Have a seat.
Breakfast is almost ready.

356
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,304
What kind of juice
do you like? Apple or orange?

357
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,273
Whichever is fine.

358
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,808
Orange it is.

359
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,712
Uh oh... are you still
upset about last night?

360
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,614
Yeah. I'd rather
just forget about it.

361
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,882
It never happened.

362
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,450
Oh, we need
to talk about it.

363
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,952
It was our first argument
and how we handle it

364
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,388
will set the foundation
for our relationship.

365
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,523
It's critical we deal
with this carefully.

366
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,325
Now, I think we can
both agree that alcohol

367
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,627
played a big roll
in our actions.

368
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,996
However, I, for one,
am not going to use

369
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,531
that as an excuse.

370
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,401
Albert!
Play nicely with Dolly!

371
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,269
So, with that said,
Norman,

372
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,372
I am really sorry for
what happened last night.

373
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,343
That felt better.

374
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,744
How about you?

375
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,715
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

376
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,585
Dori, what's the
deal with the kids?

377
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,589
My eggs!
I hope you're hungry.

378
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,891
I've fixed my world
famous Denver omelette.

379
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,359
To be honest,
it's not really mine.

380
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,360
It's my Grandpa Ed's...

381
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,395
It's a secret
family recipe.

382
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,997
Oh, what the hell,
I can tell you.

383
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,967
I use Canadian bacon
instead of ham.

384
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,002
Albert!

385
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,704
Stop riling up
your sister.

386
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,339
You know
she's got asthma!

387
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,908
I find Canadian bacon holds
its flavor better than ham.

388
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,643
Here.
Take a bite.

389
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,446
I'm anxious to see
what you think.

390
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:52,383
This is not really
the weekend I had in mind.

391
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,385
Let's not forget
our manners, Norman.

392
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,721
Those kids...
They don't have a father.

393
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,389
I figured it would be nice
to bring them up here

394
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,624
so they can
enjoy the place.

395
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,992
That's very
charitable of you,

396
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,327
but did you have
to pick this weekend?

397
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,795
- You've got
a little something -
- Jesus, Dori. Listen.

398
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,397
I gave up a lot
to be here.

399
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,532
The least you could do is
tell me we'd be babysitting

400
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,635
someone's kids.

401
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,739
Hey Mom,
when's breakfast?

402
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,841
It's ready.
Go wash up.

403
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,047
Aren't they
adorable?

404
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,017
Mommy! Albert is playing
with his food.

405
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,052
Shut up!

406
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,087
Mommy! Albert
said a bad word.

407
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,122
"Shut" is not a bad word.
'Shit' is.

408
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,124
Albert, what did I say
about your language?

409
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,727
Now both of you
eat your breakfast.

410
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,595
Hi. I'm Albert.

411
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,897
Norman.

412
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,965
Nice to finally
meet you.

413
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,837
How are you
with percentages?

414
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,005
What?

415
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,973
Do you know
your percentages?

416
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm doing them
in school right now.

417
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,779
Yeah, I know
my percentages.

418
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,581
Do you know them,

419
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,617
know them as in 'real world'
application know them?

420
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,422
Be nice, Albert.

421
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,025
Mom! I've got
a boatload of homework.

422
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,994
If this guy's shaky on his
percentages then I gotta know.

423
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,166
I told you that
I know my percentages.

424
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,235
What more do you want?

425
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,141
Are you done with
your Denver omelette?

426
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,809
Sure.

427
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,978
Isn't Dolly
a good girl?

428
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
The best.

429
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,916
You know, Mom, this isn't
really a Denver omelets

430
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,952
because you're
not using ham.

431
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,054
I am using ham,
just not American ham.

432
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,524
I'm using
Canadian ham.

433
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,192
Where's Canada?

434
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,660
North.

435
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,764
Like by the North Pole?
Next to Santa Claus?

436
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,634
Yeah, sure. Right up
next to Old St. Nick.

437
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,035
Oh, thank you
for reminding me.

438
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,104
Dude.
You're lying.

439
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,540
What are you
talking about?

440
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,975
You know what
I'm talking about?

441
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,510
Santa Claus...

442
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,844
What's wrong
with Santa Claus?

443
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,946
Norman!

444
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,048
I didn't
say anything.

445
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,786
Jesus god?

446
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,057
Why don't you two
go outside and play?

447
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,994
Can we give Norman
his surprises first?

448
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,229
Oh, I suppose we can.

449
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,165
I'll get the balloon
and the presents.

450
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,267
I'm gonna get
my special card.

451
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,107
Happy Valentine's Day!

452
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,942
Valentine's Day, Dori?

453
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,110
I know, I know.

454
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,978
A holiday created
by Madison Avenue.

455
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,713
But I can't help myself.

456
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,615
I'm a hopeless romantic.

457
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,221
Don't worry
if you forgot.

458
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,126
You wanna go give
Norman his card?

459
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,094
I made this
for you in class.

460
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:27,631
And I made this for you with
the help of American Express.

461
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,300
I wanna open it!
No! I wanna open it!

462
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,368
Careful.
Careful.

463
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,905
Ooo, pretty.

464
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,842
Look Albert,
a sparkly bear!

465
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,944
It goes
right over here.

466
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,250
And I know what
you're thinking...

467
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,852
That it's June.

468
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,155
But all the men are wearing
these things too now.

469
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,326
They're all the rage.

470
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,294
It's okay. You can go
outside and play now.

471
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,598
Finally.
This guy is so boring.

472
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,736
So, what do you think?

473
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,739
I uh... wow!
So many questions.

474
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,974
What? You don't
like the kids?

475
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,709
So many questions.

476
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,177
I know you might
think this is crazy.

477
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,812
And maybe I went about
introducing them

478
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,213
the wrong way, but...

479
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,750
Those are my kids,
and they are part of me.

480
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,619
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner

481
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,655
but I was just afraid
of how you'd react.

482
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,124
Aww, come on.
Look at us.

483
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,694
A young couple, nice house,
a couple of kids,

484
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,096
just one
thing missing...

485
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:37,601
I got you. You should've
seen your face! Priceless.

486
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,638
Boy, you are a nut!
A bona fide nut!

487
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,973
So you'll stay?

488
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,075
Dori. You can't expect me
to get excited about -

489
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,777
excited...

490
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,114
The kids go to bed early.

491
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,715
They do?

492
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,817
Yes. They do.

493
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,321
How early?

494
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,356
Real early.

495
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,691
Real early?

496
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:03,727
Real, real,
real early.

497
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,634
Dori?

498
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:13,370
Yes?

499
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,673
How did the kids
get here?

500
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,911
So this is Grandpa Ed
and Grandma Edna

501
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,067
Dori says
you sell houses.

502
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,268
That's nice.

503
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,170
A realtor?
What is that?

504
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,072
A six weeks of school
before they give you

505
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,240
a crappy red jacket?

506
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,376
I have a B.S.
in finance.

507
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,178
B.S. is right.

508
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,014
Norman buys homes whose
loans have been defaulted on

509
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,415
then he renovates
before reselling.

510
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,284
It's very profitable.

511
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,922
What do you do with the
family that's defaulted?

512
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,924
Um? What?

513
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,360
I mean what do you
with the families

514
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,729
that no longer
have a home?

515
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,130
Yeah. What do
you do with them?

516
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,934
Um, well, that's not
really my responsibility.

517
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:20,804
Making someone homeless
isn't your responsibility?

518
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,940
Well it doesn't
exactly work that way.

519
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,475
If you don't have a
home you're homeless.

520
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,344
How exactly is it
supposed to work?

521
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,079
You know, Norman, you should
really think about trying

522
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,482
to find these
families homes.

523
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,184
Noted.

524
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:38,288
So what are
your intentions?

525
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,224
Come again?

526
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,259
Your game plan, son.

527
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,362
What the hell's your game
plan when it comes to Dori?

528
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,366
Um, to be honest

529
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,202
we're not really
technically boyfriend and...

530
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,139
We just celebrated our
two month anniversary.

531
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,141
Oh!
Congratulations!

532
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,109
Anniversaries
are such a hoot.

533
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:03,347
So you both are intimate
with each another already.

534
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,182
That's always fun.

535
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,017
Grandma!

536
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,358
Dr. Fisher says
that a robust sex life

537
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,295
can lead to a long
and loving relationship.

538
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,331
And he wasn't just talking
about heavy petting, neither.

539
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,000
He was talking
about actual penetration

540
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,002
and a whole lot of it.

541
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,105
Ed penetrates
me all the time.

542
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,345
What the hell
were you thinking?

543
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,780
[DOOR SLAMS]
What I was thinking was
that it would be nice

544
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,015
for you to
meet the family.

545
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,850
I didn't even know you had
a family until ten minutes ago.

546
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,819
Everybody has a family.
Jesus Christ, Dori.

547
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,954
A relationship is a give
and take proposition.

548
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,422
You can't just have
sex from a woman

549
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,157
and expect to give
something in return.

550
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,460
What on earth are
you talking about?

551
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,895
You know very well Albert is
struggling with percentages.

552
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,797
He could use
your help.

553
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,299
Oh, you need
my math skills?

554
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,835
Listen! Dori,
you're a lovely girl.

555
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,436
And I'm sure you're going to
make someone very happy one day.

556
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,138
But man o' man,
you need some fucking

557
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,673
big time
professional help.

558
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,346
That song?
It's about a stalker.

559
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,149
And Pralines and Cream?
It's disgusting.

560
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,319
So have a nice day,
an even better life.

561
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:18,555
I'll see you
on the other side.

562
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,224
What the?

563
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,925
What happened
to my steering wheel?

564
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,926
What?

565
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,296
What the fuck happened
to my steering wheel?

566
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,464
Your language,
Norman.

567
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,933
Where's my fucking
steering wheel!

568
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,236
Oh boy. We have some
degenerate teenagers in town-

569
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,505
You sawed off
my steering wheel!

570
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,206
Are you accusing
me of stealing?

571
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,408
I'm accusing you of
being out of your mind!

572
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,944
You know how much this
is going to cost me?

573
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,447
I'll go find Grandpa, see if he
can give you a ride into town.

574
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,982
There's a general
store there.

575
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,483
A general store?

576
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,086
This is a fucking Porsche
not a stage coach!

577
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,220
They have
lots of stuff.

578
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,323
You'd be surprised.

579
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,126
'Keep it together.
Where's my phone.

580
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,228
Fuck!
My phone's inside'

581
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,907
Oh yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

582
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,442
Come on?

583
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,510
Okay Andrew,
pick up.

584
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,612
Pick up Andrew.
Pick up.

585
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,252
Hola, que tal?

586
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,253
Oh thank God.

587
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,123
This chick is
out of her gourd.

588
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,124
Mom?

589
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,158
Is that you?

590
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,260
Stop fucking around.

591
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,129
It sounds like
you're in a well

592
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,932
More like
another planet. Listen..

593
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:38,101
Dori. She's a
complete whack job.

594
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,537
Oh, Dori, right.
How's that going?

595
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,173
Uh. Well,
she's crazy, man.

596
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,409
Are we talking "takes it
in the two-hole" crazy?

597
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,244
Skye, not too far.

598
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:50,147
Or "brings a friend
into bed" crazy?

599
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:53,083
More like sawing off my
steering wheels crazy.

600
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,453
Nah.
Can't hear you.

601
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,556
Dori thinks today
is Valentine's Day.

602
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,427
Did you say she thinks
today is 'Valentine's Day'?

603
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,929
Yeah. She's got hearts
all over the house.

604
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:06,997
It's June.

605
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,532
That's what I said.

606
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,301
Karma's a bitch

607
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,669
don't say
that word, honey.

608
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,538
Yeah, you know what?
Your sympathy is heart-warming.

609
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,440
Well what do
you want to hear?

610
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,175
You leave me
with all the work.

611
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,710
That's not a very
kind thing to do.

612
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,179
Oh my god?

613
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,381
Dude, this shit is
getting weirder by the minute.

614
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,383
You gotta
get yourself up here.

615
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,585
Eh. Back in the well.
Can't hear ya.

616
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,354
Get yourself up here!

617
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,222
Well where's up here?

618
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,092
Who are you talking to?

619
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,661
Just checking
my voicemail on speaker.

620
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,973
And I can see how
a lot of men can feel...

621
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,074
Well... Cramped,

622
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,610
or even trapped,
in a relationship.

623
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,345
I don't blame them.

624
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,481
Some girls, my God,
they expect their boyfriends

625
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,051
to give up everything
to be with them.

626
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,086
Not me.

627
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,489
I understand the need
for Saturday night poker

628
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,090
with the guys.

629
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,727
"Don't smother your man",
that's what I always say.

630
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,767
Just let me
love you, Norman.

631
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,368
Let us love you.

632
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,770
Is that so hard?

633
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:25,609
Ouch!

634
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,545
That looks
like it hurt.

635
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,647
Are you okay?

636
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,417
What the fuck
is going on here?

637
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,451
It's Easter!

638
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,253
Don't use that language
in front of the kids.

639
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,755
Fuck you and your kids!
Untie my hands.

640
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,190
Kids, leave the room.

641
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,291
I wanna watch.

642
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:46,396
Let's go wake up Grandpa up
and find some Easter eggs!

643
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,771
You're getting yourself
into big trouble.

644
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,074
You've gone too far, Dori.

645
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,678
I'm calling the cops.

646
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,846
What are you doing?

647
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,614
Do you know how hard
it is for a woman

648
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,550
with two kids
to meet a decent guy,

649
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,152
let alone have him
fall in love with her?

650
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,355
Try E-fucking-Harmony.

651
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,556
When a guy
first meets a girl

652
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,193
he's all, 'You're so
beautiful, la, la, la.'

653
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,528
Then the girl gets
excited and thinks,

654
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,132
'He might be the
one, la, la, la.'

655
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,167
Then she lets her guard
down, invites him in,

656
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,702
cooks for him,
cleans for him,

657
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:30,440
swallows for him,
la, la, la.

658
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,843
Then he sees
the kids and POOF!

659
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,844
He's gone.

660
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,213
La. La. La.

661
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,448
You never even told
me you had kids.

662
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,450
Had I told you then you
would have never said 'yes'

663
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,653
to coming up here, right?

664
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,756
That's what I thought.

665
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:52,195
See, the problem with men is
that they tend to react more

666
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,731
to the situation
rather than the person.

667
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,833
You should fall in love
with the person regardless

668
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,337
of the situation.

669
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,206
Now, you might be
asking yourself,

670
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,209
'How do I get
to know someone?'

671
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,344
Good question.

672
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,447
That's where
Dr. Fisher comes in.

673
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,450
In 'The Twelve Steps to a
Happy New Year' he says that...

674
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,218
'Different
holidays naturally

675
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,320
evoke different
emotions in people.

676
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,623
It's important to experience
all of those emotions

677
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,459
in order to really
get to know someone.'

678
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:32,269
Now obviously you're not a
big fan of Valentine's Day...

679
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,372
But what's not to
love about Easter?

680
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,645
Enough is enough!

681
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,780
This is insane!

682
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,583
Is he ready?
Can we come in?

683
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,785
Okay kids.
It's time.

684
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,387
Oh yeah?

685
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,688
There's one!

686
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,824
Here's an orange one!

687
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,659
I found it!

688
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,794
No wait.
It's mine!

689
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,864
Hey kids, no fighting
on Easter. Alright?

690
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,734
How's he doing?

691
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,704
Needless to say,
the honeymoon's over.

692
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,540
And now the real
work begins.

693
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,813
You people need
major fucking help!

694
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,382
Your language,
Norman...

695
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,384
My language, Dori?
Blow me!

696
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,286
Mom!

697
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,422
Grandpa never asked
if he could use my bat.

698
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,723
Now I'm sure
Grandpa didn't mean

699
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,358
to take it without
your permission.

700
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,659
I certainly did not.

701
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,661
And I'm sorry.

702
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,764
Oh my goodness.
I almost forgot my pie.

703
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,228
I see snow on the
table, Grandma.

704
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,329
Whoops!

705
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,232
Thank you for reminding
me about my manners, dear.

706
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,001
You're welcome.

707
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:14,804
Dori, what did you do
differently with this chicken?

708
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:15,872
I changed the marinade.

709
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,541
I used lemon and
garlic this time.

710
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,876
Oh. It's
simply wonderful.

711
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,345
How do you
like it, Norman?

712
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,849
So many times I would try
to do something fancy

713
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,952
and I would ruin
the taste of the meat.

714
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,855
I've tasted something
like this before.

715
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,357
But I can't
remember when.

716
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,328
It was Jackie's seventy
eighth birthday party.

717
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,629
That's right.

718
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,499
The village threw a
party and it was catered.

719
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,768
Chirpin Chicken!

720
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,970
Oh, Ed.
Don't be a putz.

721
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,072
Chirpin Chicken!?

722
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,680
Are you sure you
don't want anything to eat?

723
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,517
It's organic.

724
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,553
No dinner. No desert.

725
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,459
That's right.
No dinner, no dessert.

726
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:12,362
Was it Rhonda's
Rotisserie?

727
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,464
I don't think so.

728
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,536
Mommy, he stuck
his tongue out at me!

729
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:23,940
Now, would you please have
a little something to eat.

730
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:27,377
How can I be expected to eat
if I can't use my hands?

731
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,945

00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,314

I know! It was Conrad's
Crispy Catered Chicken.

739
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,393
Conrad died
in ninety three.

740
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,495
It was ninety five...
I remember.

741
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,598
I wanna feed him!

742
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,599
No! I get to!

I refuse to be
fed by a child!

746
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:54,804
I remember!

747
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:58,908
It was Billy's Broiled,
Shake and Baked Chicken!

748
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,043
That was it!

749
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,444
I remember that.

Norman, is this because
you're afraid of commitment?

969
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,145
It's because she's
fucking kidnapped me.

970
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,047
It's because she's beaten
the shit out of me

971
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,515
and shackled me
to the floor.

972
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:34,650
It's because she's ripped
the steering wheel

973
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,518
out of my fucking car!

974
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,054
Does Dr. Fisher have
a chapter on that one?

975
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:41,023
You do nothing
but finger point.

976
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,725
When are you going to start
owning up to your mistakes?

977
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:47,196
- You cheated on me,
Goddamn you!
- For the love of God, woman!

978
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:49,198
You're putting up walls
and retreating into yourself.

979

I'm retreating because you
scare the shit out of me!

you to see Taming of the Shrew?

00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,997
It was our third date?

Oh! was that you?

983
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,235
You were walking back

984
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:29,137
from getting us
drinks our eyes locked

985
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,206
and you had
a look on your face.

986
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,075
What was it?
What was that look?

987
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:34,610
I don't know, Dori.

Was there ever a chance
for you to love me?

993

I don't even know
what that word means.

994
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,267
That is such a shame,

995
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:01,169
because you have no idea
what you're missing.

996

Can I just
say something?

997
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,331
Of course, Norman.

Why don't I take charge
of one of the holidays?

1008
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,840
So now you want
to do a holiday?

1009
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,710
Yeah! Hey, why don't we
celebrate Mother's Day?

What would
Dr. Fisher say?

Well, that's
a good question.

1014
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,960
Dr. Fisher always says you
need to forgive your partner.

Forgive Dori,

has no hope

forgive Norman

another chance.

I'm willing to try.

nothing to you, Norman.

I know. But they
mean something to you.

And that means
something to me.

you what I'm capable of.

I remember.

1127

Hold on a second?

01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,801
What's that for?

Don't you think
forty is uh-

1130
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,406
Forty out of fifty
is a tad high?

1131
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,209
She deserves a
fifty out of fifty.

1132
01:06:57,114 --> 01:07:01,483
And it upsets me that you
think I should have to settle.

Come on, Dori. It's not settling
that much - thirty-five?

1134
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,088
It's still above average.

1135
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,858
So you're okay with
being just average?

1136
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,395
Above average.

1137
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,662
Wow.
Okay then.

1138
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:18,666
Let's all vote on this slightly
above average relationship.

All we need is
seven points per person

above average family together.

A four?

Only reason why you're even
getting that many is

brought home a ten."

A ten! Yes!
Hi five, little buddy!

1163
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,855
But...

1164
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:17,759
then you opened
your potty mouth.

'Shit'...

Eleven times...

And you told mom
to 'blow me' once.

I'm not sure what that means
but I can tell it's bad.

1177
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,859
Oh, and I'm not
including the word "poo"

1178
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,727
because Dolly and I
are allowed to say it.

Ha-ha!
He said poo!

Alright fine, minus one point
for having a potty mouth.

1181
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,236
That's a nine.

1182

And speaking of potty,
I don't want a dad

Okay, now...
That's not fair!

another point.

points. Who's next?

is what percent?

is what percent?

know the answer?

that as a no.

this relationship more than me.

don't do this.

As we go about the chaos

we're left
wondering how, when,

or even if it will
ever happen to us.
