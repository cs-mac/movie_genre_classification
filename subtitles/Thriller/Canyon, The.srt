1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:05,126
(flute music playing)

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,682
(birds chirping)

3
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,762
(eagle cries)

4
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,813
(heart beating)

5
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:35,081
(panting)

6
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,987
Man: We're all gonna die.
We're all gonna die!

7
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,923
Man #2: Quiet!

8
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,494
Man: It's your fault.
You killed us all!

9
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:47,192
Man #2:
Yeah, well,

10
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,759
I intend spending Christmas
with my daughter this year.

11
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,239
- I don't know about you.
- (groans)

12
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,675
We're gonna make it out of here.
We're gonna live!

13
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,803
- (groaning)
- What is it?

14
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,047
- Hold still.
- (shouts)

15
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,686
Now let's go.

16
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,007
Wait.
I can't breathe.

17
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,620
(grunts)

18
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,607
(groans)

19
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,289
(gunshots)

20
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,463
(grunting)

21
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,159
(creature growls)

22
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,201
(growling)

23
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,075
(men whimpering)

24
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,457
(low growling)

25
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,735
(screams)

26
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,083
(screaming)

27
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,883
(creature hisses, chomps)

28
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:46,398
(growling, screaming)

29
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,575
(bird cries)

30
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:09,355
(man cheering)

31
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,694
Ms. Jordan! Ms. Jordan!

32
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:17,498
I got something.
I got something.

33
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:20,004
There's tons of them over there.

34
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,771
I didn't realize coal crackers
were indigenous to this area.

35
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,505
What's a coal cracker?

36
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,343
This area was mined for coal
up until about 10 years ago.

37
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:32,407
A miner must have left it behind.
You can get it out of a Sears Catalogue.

38
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:37,117
Don't worry. I'm sure
in another 2,000 years

39
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:40,056
it will be just as valuable
as the treasures of Egypt.

40
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,681
- Dr. Thain?
- Yes, Ms. Jordan?

41
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:07,582
Any word on my father?

42
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,553
Nothing, I'm afraid.

43
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,580
And the Smithsonian...
are they sending someone after him?

44
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,115
They do not share your concern.

45
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,151
He's been missing for a month.

46
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,629
You father abandoned his work here
to go off on his own.

47
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,962
They're not happy.

48
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:24,468
But they will take credit
for his discoveries.

49
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:28,462
Your father's theory that
the Egyptians set foot in North America

50
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:32,102
is highly improbable
to say the least.

51
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:35,136
- You think he's a liar.
- No, I think he's old.

52
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:38,513
People still studied alchemy
when he got his doctorate.

53
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:53,326
Dr. Thain! Dr. Thain!

54
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,664
Uh, excuse me.

55
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,508
Another beheading.

56
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,607
Doesn't seem like the Hopi, does it?

57
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:14,016
Perhaps a rival tribe.

58
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,417
See here, the occipital bone?

59
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:22,484
It's very good work, Dr. Langford.

60
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,085
See the separation right here

61
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,495
as if a blunt object
repetitively hacked...

62
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:30,262
Yes, excellent. Why don't you catalogue
it and place it with the other one?

63
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,269
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

64
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,569
Of course.

65
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,308
Very good work here.
Very good.

66
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:43,872
That was horrible.

67
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:47,407
That was for his own good. Perhaps if
he picked a shovel up once in a while

68
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:49,682
he'd actually get
something accomplished.

69
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:52,212
- (hisses)
- (laughs)

70
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,667
(sighs)

71
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,139
Ms. Jordan, it's not that I don't
respect your father. It's...

72
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,411
What a lovely blouse.

73
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,921
Ms. Jordan, have you ever
seen the Aztec codices?

74
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,719
Wonderful works of art,
rivaling anything in the Western world.

75
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,589
I have a copy if you'd like...

76
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,619
to see them.
Wow.

77
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,824
No, I didn't think so.

78
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,178
(horse nickers)

79
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,483
Yeah, boy.

80
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,419
Whoa.

81
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,676
I'm looking for Professor Jordan.

82
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,684
Dr. Jordan hasn't returned.
I'm his assistant Dr. Wainwright.

83
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm a friend of Dr. Jordan's...
Isaac Preston.

84
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,582
I work for "The Phoenix Gazette"
in Phoenix.

85
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,352
That's aptly named, isn't it?

86
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:37,350
I did a story with Dr. Jordan last month
and we're preparing a follow-up.

87
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,660
- I wasn't told of any press interview.
- An honest mistake, I'm sure.

88
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,167
I forget to mention things
to my secretary all the time.

89
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,659
I'm a tenured professor and Dr. Jordan's
right hand on this project.

90
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,071
Well, let's hope he's a lefty.
(laughs)

91
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:53,798
Susan!

92
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:58,079
- Still hanging around, I see.
- Isaac.

93
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,380
Have you seen my father?

94
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,819
Not since our interview, no.
But he told me to meet him here today

95
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,551
so I could get some photographs
of the pieces he discovered.

96
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,650
You've seen them then?

97
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,662
Yeah, I last saw him and his men
in a cantina near Morelia

98
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:13,357
just before he set out.

99
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,325
Found these in a cave.

100
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:21,135
- He gave them to you?
- I've known him for years.

101
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,434
He wanted me to photograph them.
Here.

102
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,182
The Hopi say...

103
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:35,084
they come from a great pyramid
hidden behind the canyon wall.

104
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,486
- Pyramid?
- Built by men

105
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:39,683
who preserve the dead
in shrouds.

106
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:42,625
Something's wrong.
If he said he was going to be here,

107
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,925
he should be here.
He never breaks his word.

108
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,897
She's right to worry.

109
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:49,923
He wouldn't be the first person
to get lost in the canyons.

110
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:52,368
- The Indians took him there?
- Ha! No. No no no.

111
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:54,998
They won't go near the place.
They say it's cursed.

112
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:57,508
No, he found some Mexicans
willing to take him.

113
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:01,000
- That is where I last saw him.
- Wainwright: And that was a month ago?

114
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,741
Yes yes.

115
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,184
I've been waiting for his return.
My readers are less patient than I.

116
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:10,915
- This is remarkable.
- Yeah, this one is my favorite too.

117
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,651
It's like a finger puppet
if you get it on there just right.

118
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:16,058
Are these really Egyptian?

119
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:18,824
Well, they were magnificent seamen.

120
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:21,559
I mean, only a few years ago
they found

121
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,693
some Egyptian hieroglyphics on
a rock cliff in Australian, so surely...

122
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,000
Dr. Jordan's Egyptian discovery.

123
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,735
Matter of fact it is. See,
while you're in your tent scribbling,

124
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,710
some of us are actually putting
our time here to some good use.

125
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,737
Indulging in fantasy is hardly
a good use of time.

126
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:39,443
You don't believe it's real?

127
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,089
It's real, but not Egyptian.

128
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,389
I'm sure if you would have
studied it longer,

129
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,657
you would have
identified it as a labret.

130
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:55,530
It was worn here,
through a hole in the lower lip.

131
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,592
That's disgusting.
There's a lady present.

132
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,263
Thain: It was a mark of beauty
throughout the primitive world:

133
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:05,242
Africa, the Indus Valley,
South America, but not, however, Egypt.

134
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,743
Wainwright:
So where's it from?

135
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:08,439
Thain: My guess would be Mexico,
the Aztecs.

136
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,505
That looks like
the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.

137
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,607
Or any of 100 serpent gods
from any culture.

138
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,346
Who cares where it came from?
My father is out there lost.

139
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:18,685
- Isn't anybody going to do something?
- The Smithsonian will not allow it.

140
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:21,988
- Their budget is already allocated.
- I'm not talking about the Smithsonian.

141
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,392
- I'm talking about us.
- Thain: Don't be foolish.

142
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:27,193
The desert kills people,
even the Indians.

143
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,166
You wouldn't last a day out there.

144
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,725
Don't attribute your own
cowardice to the rest of us.

145
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,965
Cowardice, is that...

146
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:38,003
Isaac?
Where was the cantina?

147
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,408
Morelia.

148
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:42,413
- I leave tomorrow.
- Okay.

149
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,445
We should cover the pits.
It's going to rain soon.

150
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,324
There isn't a cloud in the sky.

151
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,992
(thunder crashes)

152
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,833
Looks like rain, everyone.
Let's cover the pits.

153
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,340
- Let's go!
- Man: Let's go, let's go!

154
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,209
- What's wrong with you?
- I was just thinking.

155
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,873
Quetzalcoatl was
the Aztec god of rain.

156
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:21,310
Among other things.

157
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,150
(snoring)

158
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,858
(coyote howling)

159
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,152
- (chuckles)
- Oh!

160
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:34,920
What do you think you're doing?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

161
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,450
(stammers)
But... but...

162
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,656
- But what?
- But you're in my tent.

163
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:42,598
- It's the middle of the night.
- And that would make you think

164
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:44,932
that I would
want to with you?

165
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,960
Well, what else should I think?

166
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,337
You should think like a gentleman.

167
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,467
You don't think a gentleman
would want to have sex?

168
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,238
You're disgusting.

169
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,940
Oh, well, if you're not here
to sleep with me,

170
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,470
what are you doing here?

171
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,815
Well, this is Dr. Jordan's tent.

172
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:06,346
And I was just
looking for some files.

173
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:09,792
And... and so I didn't want
to disturb you. And...

174
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,660
There's no filing cabinet in here.

175
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:15,790
Good night, Mr. Preston.

176
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,859
Ms. Wainwright.

177
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,885
(exhales)

178
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,733
Whoa.

179
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,797
(man whistling)

180
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,542
I'm fine, thank you.

181
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,448
- This way.
- (grunts)

182
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,185
He was just trying to be friendly.

183
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,624
They may be friendly
and charming,

184
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:51,560
but when they look at you,
you're not an equal.

185
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,259
If you want a career, you've got to be
ruthless and uncompromising.

186
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,995
- That's how men get ahead.
- Not all of them.

187
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:01,836
- If you're thinking of Dr. Langford...
- I'm thinking of my father.

188
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:05,502
- Consider Dr. Thain.
- I'd prefer not.

189
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:08,535
He doesn't let personal relationships
get in the way of his work.

190
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,343
- He has no personal relationships.
- That's a choice.

191
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,408
He knows that there are
more important things.

192
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:17,421
Then why are you here
looking for my father?

193
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:20,913
Dr. Jordan was looking for treasure.
I'm doing the same.

194
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:23,324
Do you think Dr. Jordan really
found something big?

195
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:26,159
Jordan can exaggerate, but if the truth
is 1/10th of the claim,

196
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,290
we're headed toward
the find of the century.

197
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,596
- Dr. Jordan's find.
- If he's still around.

198
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:32,569
That's a hell of a thing
to say about a friend.

199
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,366
A friend is one thing.
A discovery like that...

200
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:37,238
Like your friends in the Amazon.

201
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:40,870
If there's one rule I try to follow
it's leave no man behind.

202
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,039
- What happened in the Amazon?
- Nobody knows.

203
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,073
Because the team never made it back...
that is except Dr. Langford.

204
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:52,022
Yes, well, Jordan wasn't there,
so whatever he told you...

205
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,219
He told me nothing... except that
you made quite a name for yourself

206
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:57,750
and seemed to forget the names
of the men that died.

207
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,423
I shared the credit with them all.

208
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:03,901
The next time you make an accusation
like that, you should check your facts.

209
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,869
Are you offering me an exclusive?

210
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:11,041
Well, this is it.

211
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,296
Buenos días, amigo.
(speaking Spanish)

212
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:42,204
- What did he look like?
- You speak English.

213
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:45,767
He's an elderly gentleman.
He arrived here a few months ago.

214
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,108
I say what he look like?

215
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,238
This is him.
He came here with several men.

216
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:56,412
No sé.
(speaks Spanish)

217
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,282
Back to Spanish, hmm?
Listen, if you know something,

218
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,383
- you're obliged to...
- Isaac: Excuse me!

219
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,554
I was with Dr. Jordan two months ago
when he came here.

220
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,587
He was looking
for some Mexican gentlemen.

221
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:10,396
I say no sé, cowboy.

222
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:14,097
- Of course. I remember now.
- It's a friendly place.

223
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,663
Thank you very much for your help.
We'll be leaving.

224
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,175
Don Pedro know nothing, but I do.

225
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,735
Who are you?

226
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,770
Hugo... Hugo San Martin.

227
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,839
I'm Dr. Langford.

228
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,147
These are my colleagues
from the Smithsonian.

229
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:30,120
Have you seen him?

230
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,987
He went into the canyons.
He don't come back.

231
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:36,084
- Are you sure it's him?
- Of course. I take him there.

232
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,527
- Susan: What happened to him?
- I don't know.

233
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:41,054
I don't go inside.
No one goes inside.

234
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:42,861
Can you show us
where you took him?

235
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,027
Is three days' drive from here.

236
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,561
Once you get there, you are on
your own. I no go to the another side.

237
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,870
- Why not?
- No one does.

238
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,274
If they do, they don't come back.

239
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:55,506
How do we get there?

240
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:57,741
You pay me, we go.

241
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,580
- How much?
- 50 is good.

242
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,384
Not until after you take us there.

243
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,720
25 now and 25 later.

244
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,850
Deal.

245
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:14,264
You wait here, I'll be back.

246
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:19,933
I don't trust him.

247
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,337
Neither do I, but I trust
he wants his money.

248
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:24,398
What if he did something
to Dr. Jordan?

249
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,138
You're an idiot.

250
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,339
What did I say?

251
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,689
I'll show you,
but I need another 25.

252
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:43,819
No, we already discussed this.
Not until you take us there.

253
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,352
Not for me. For Javier.

254
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:47,796
I hired you.

255
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:50,323
You need horses.
They belong to him.

256
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:54,634
- What do I need you for then?
- I know Javier and you don't.

257
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,902
Oh, that's a good point.

258
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:59,967
We leave in the morning.

259
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,339
(grunting)

260
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:08,511
(drums beating)

261
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,577
(crowd murmuring)

262
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,861
(screaming)

263
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:43,340
Langford:
How much further?

264
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,246
San Martin:
Other side of the mountain.

265
00:24:45,246 --> 00:24:49,548
- What mountains?
- See, up ahead? Three days.

266
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,118
Whoa whoa.

267
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,722
Isaac:
It's Dr. Jordan's horse.

268
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,682
It was my father's.

269
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,916
The last entry was
three weeks ago.

270
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,319
Where's Dr. Jordan?

271
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,315
"The precipice stands
100 feet straight up.

272
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:31,988
Our first attempt to scale
the wall ended in failure.

273
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,463
We will try again in the morning.

274
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:37,399
I remit this book to you,
Susan my daughter,

275
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:40,495
in the event that we are
again unsuccessful."

276
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,564
That sounds like he was
planning on mailing it.

277
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,730
Oh!

278
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:53,073
(gasps)

279
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,783
Who is it?

280
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:58,686
It was Joe Ford.

281
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:00,815
Jordan hired him
to carry equipment.

282
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:06,158
- We have to bury him.
- Coyotes'll get him by morning.

283
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:09,428
- Better coyotes than vultures.
- Wainwright: What's the difference?

284
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,458
We'll bury him.

285
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,740
(whispering)

286
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:31,049
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,387
We go so far enough.
This land is cursed.

288
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:36,916
- But how are we supposed to get back?
- Leave the horses.

289
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,485
Vaya con Dios.

290
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,765
- Yah!
- Yippee!

291
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,004
Come on, let's go.

292
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:33,107
Let's go!

293
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,879
Man:
That horse doesn't look so good.

294
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:36,978
It's fine. It just needs
a little encouragement.

295
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:38,511
- Come on!
- (horse wheezes)

296
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:41,753
I'm not going to die out here because
you can't handle a little heat. Come on!

297
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,467
- It's so awful.
- I'm sure it didn't suffer much.

298
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:55,267
Who cares about the horse?
What are we going to do?

299
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:59,971
- We'll all walk.
- Langford: Let's go.

300
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,317
What is that?

301
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,722
- Susan: One of those men?
- It doesn't look like a man.

302
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,229
Langford:
Where is he going?

303
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:56,198
Man:
He's found water.

304
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,199
Langford: Let's quickly fill
the canteens and keep moving.

305
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:09,110
What is it?

306
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,580
I don't know, but there's
one of them and five of us.

307
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,979
- Stuck... I'm stuck.
- What's happening?

308
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,216
- What's happening?!
- Here, take my hand.

309
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,019
No no no, Susan, relax.

310
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,721
You guys, try not to move.

311
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,128
Okay, Susan, it's quicksand.

312
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:29,893
You have to help them.

313
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,060
Susan...

314
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,610
Isaac, reach for the stick.

315
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,203
Reach.

316
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:46,307
(grunting)

317
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,952
- Grab this.
- Langford: Hildy.

318
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,291
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.

319
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,630
Langford:
Isaac, Isaac, grab hold.

320
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,794
Be careful. Be careful.

321
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:07,667
Pull, Isaac.

322
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,416
- I'm getting the gun.
- What? No!

323
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,158
- Dr. Thain?
- What?

324
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,060
(all grunt)

325
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,292
Don't move, don't move, don't move.
Stay still.

326
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,994
(mule brays)

327
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:40,128
No, they'll just pull you in.

328
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,195
(panting)

329
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,934
Stop moving, Isaac.
Stay still.

330
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,378
(whistles)

331
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,392
(mule brays)

332
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:17,000
Leave no man behind?

333
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,473
What about us?

334
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:24,072
We should thank you, actually.
You found our water source.

335
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:26,082
I hate to tell you, but that stuff
doesn't taste very good.

336
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:28,448
Well, there's a well
of groundwater beneath us.

337
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,419
The soil here is too porous.

338
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,514
But over there,
all we need to do is dig.

339
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,493
Why did you come?
I thought it was too dangerous.

340
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,595
Academic curiosity.

341
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:01,943
(creature snarling, crunching)

342
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:20,168
- We're close.
- How do you know?

343
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:24,140
Well, if anyone lives around here,

344
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,233
they'd need a water source.

345
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,710
(water trickling)

346
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,679
Is that real?

347
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,012
That's real.

348
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:35,177
(men laughing)

349
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:37,915
Come on, Isaac.

350
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,651
Isaac:
I'm coming. I'm coming.

351
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,295
How did you find us?

352
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,173
Uh...

353
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,178
the bartender in that cantina
told me of a shortcut.

354
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:04,476
- The bartender?
- Yes.

355
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:07,745
I took a train two towns up
and cut you off from the north.

356
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:10,446
I came across your tracks
about a mile back.

357
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:14,053
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,083
Normally you're in your tent
with your head in a book.

359
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,140
Quetzalcoatl...

360
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,980
Aztecs.

361
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:47,153
Bravo, Dr. Thain.

362
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,851
How do we get around it?

363
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:54,022
We don't.
We go over it.

364
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:55,429
- (gunshot)
- (gasps)

365
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,955
Spread out. Get down!

366
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,366
(gunshots)

367
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:02,531
Get back!
Get back or I'll kill you all!

368
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,709
Susan, Susan!

369
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,239
Susan, where are you going?

370
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,309
Where is she going?

371
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,346
To get shot, from the looks of it.

372
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:28,488
(grunts)

373
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:36,399
Dr. Gilmore, is that you?

374
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,271
Oh, you found us.

375
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,037
Thank heaven.

376
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,238
Thank heaven
you found us.

377
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,748
Gilmore: Your father and the others
went over days ago...

378
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:53,221
or maybe weeks.
I don't even know anymore.

379
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:56,487
But he's inside, sweetheart,
and I don't think he's coming out.

380
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,254
There was noise
that first night... loud...

381
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:04,358
drums beating,
screaming, shouting.

382
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,437
Something bad happens
when they beat those drums.

383
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:10,963
I don't know what it is,
but it's something bad.

384
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:13,340
How did they get inside?

385
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,540
Climbed over the rocks...
the ones that made it.

386
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,846
- What about you?
- I didn't make it, did I?

387
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,316
- The other ones weren't so lucky.
- Susan: Here.

388
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,949
Have some more water.

389
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,094
Before they went over,
they sent a man

390
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,963
back to town to send
your father's book to you.

391
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:38,900
Yeah, we found it.

392
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,597
We've got to get over that wall.

393
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,401
Are you blind?

394
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,635
Look at him.

395
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,768
Her father could be
dying in there.

396
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:50,678
- Climbing is too dangerous.
- Gilmore: That's right.

397
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:53,114
You don't have
the right equipment.

398
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:55,812
We've gotta get back to town
and get some help.

399
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:58,480
No, he could be dead by then.
We have to get inside.

400
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,514
We'll just have to follow
the same path they do.

401
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:05,790
- Who?
- Whoever beats those drums.

402
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,990
They must have a way
of getting in and out.

403
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,829
Why don't you find out then?

404
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,927
Because I'm going over that wall.

405
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,632
(stream flowing)

406
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,262
Oh...

407
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,357
no no, I wasn't...

408
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,300
I was... I was sketching.

409
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,166
Not-not-not you.

410
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,729
The cliffside and the bird
flew over and...

411
00:37:56,729 --> 00:37:57,929
and, uh...

412
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,274
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

413
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:04,212
I'm so... I'm sorry.

414
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,875
This is different.

415
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,471
What? What is it?

416
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:39,277
Look, look at the original.

417
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:42,308
There's no hammer
in the original.

418
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,784
So someone else painted it.

419
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,155
The hammer's been repainted
and more than once from the looks of it.

420
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:51,217
They must have worn it out.

421
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,092
Worn out, but how?

422
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,189
Why is a doorknob shiny?

423
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,750
(rocks grating)

424
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:52,381
- What's going on?
- Dr. Thain's found a way in.

425
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:57,326
Where do you find
the time for it all?

426
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,454
I really wasn't spying.

427
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:03,432
Langford: Pervert.

428
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,867
Well, we should get moving.

429
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,635
God help us.

430
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,813
Man:
Dr. Thain, what is that book?

431
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:30,656
The Aztec codices. They contain just
about everything known about the Aztecs.

432
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:34,221
- Who's the guy with the hammer?
- Quetzalcoatl, a major Aztec god.

433
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:37,062
- Does it really eat people?
- That is just mythology.

434
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,330
Susan: What are Aztecs
doing in North America?

435
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,894
Their capital was in Mexico,
but many of them were nomadic.

436
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:45,396
It possible they made it this far north.
Driven out by the Spanish, perhaps.

437
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,239
How come we've never
heard of them?

438
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,178
Well, no one has ever produced
a complete map of this territory.

439
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:53,114
It's possible we're the first humans
to stumble upon this cave

440
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,845
- in hundreds of years.
- Second. My father was first.

441
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:58,149
Of course.

442
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:02,387
Langford:
It's a dead end.

443
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:05,292
Not an end, another doorway.

444
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:09,226
Don't just stand there.

445
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:11,563
I wouldn't do that.

446
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:14,092
The eye...
symbol of knowledge.

447
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,736
- (Langford grunts)
- Thain: Stop it!

448
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,742
Why? I think it's working.

449
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,335
Even if we get through that door,
how do we find Dr. Jordan?

450
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,780
You leave that to me.
We decided if we got separated...

451
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,783
- Stop that!
- Yeah, really really stop it.

452
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,751
- What is that noise?
- We should not be

453
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,811
drawing attention to ourselves.

454
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:34,323
(Susan screams)

455
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,450
(groans)

456
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,364
Excellent work, Dr. Langford.
Help me move him.

457
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,732
How can you be so cold?

458
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:53,038
Say a prayer, if you like.
It won't help.

459
00:41:53,038 --> 00:41:56,045
We still need to find our way
through this doorway.

460
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,513
What is wrong with you?

461
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,942
Don't you see?

462
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:04,613
It's all written here.

463
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:14,697
We must balance these stones
to open the doorway.

464
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:18,565
Wha... what happens
if we don't balance them?

465
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,064
Let's not make
any more mistakes.

466
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:25,904
Should we just stand here
and be your guinea pigs?

467
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,706
- Why not? Dr. Gilmore was yours.
- Stop it.

468
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:30,610
Just let him finish.

469
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:34,740
- For your sake.
- No, for everybody's sake.

470
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,945
We need to work together.

471
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,716
What do we do?

472
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:41,917
We must place them
all at the same time.

473
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,153
How do we know
this will work?

474
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:47,857
Trial and error. How many more
blades do you think there are?

475
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,026
At the same time now.

476
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,602
Three, two,

477
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:56,602
one.

478
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:00,136
(rumbling)

479
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:01,768
Everyone down!

480
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,523
(stones rumbling)

481
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,167
Hey hey hey!

482
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,793
(groaning)

483
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,265
How are we supposed
to get back?

484
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:36,005
- What is that?
- That is a miracle.

485
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,951
(drums beating)

486
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,088
I wouldn't call it that exactly.

487
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,957
(crowd hooting)

488
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,398
That's Dr. Wilson.

489
00:44:03,398 --> 00:44:05,464
What's happening?
Give me that.

490
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:11,080
(grunting)

491
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,139
They're putting him on a table.

492
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:16,913
- Is there a knife?
- Not that I can see.

493
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:19,945
Wait... the big one has a knife.

494
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:22,787
I think we've seen enough.
You should put those away.

495
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,952
Here, let me see.

496
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:27,963
- Susan, don't!
- Why is he...

497
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,090
(screaming)

498
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,193
(squishing)

499
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:51,516
(thunder rumbling)

500
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:02,493
(creature growls)

501
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:33,391
What are we going to do?
We're all going to die.

502
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,397
Just calm down.
We will be all right.

503
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:37,592
Are you crazy?
That thing

504
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:40,762
- just tore him apart.
- Wainwright: What was it?

505
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:43,465
I believe it was supposed
to be Quetzalcoatl.

506
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,599
Langford:
The Aztec god?

507
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,406
I said supposed to be.
Quetzalcoatl was a benevolent god.

508
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:51,607
- He only accepted animal sacrifices.
- That was not benevolent.

509
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,640
Who cares what it's supposed to be?
It killed Dr. Wilson.

510
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,084
A man with a knife killed him.
It was a sacrifice.

511
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:59,179
Oh, well, that makes it okay.

512
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:02,157
I'm just saying let's not
abandon logic completely

513
00:46:02,157 --> 00:46:04,523
because we saw something
we do not understand.

514
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,892
I don't understand you.

515
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:10,227
(footsteps approach)

516
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,234
- Susan, is that you?
- Samuel!

517
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:13,234
Dad?

518
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:17,531
- Dad, Dad.
- Susan, it is you.

519
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,402
Are you all right?

520
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:24,037
Never better.

521
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:27,748
We have to kill them
to find the circle stone.

522
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:30,844
- What stone?
- It's the only way out.

523
00:46:30,844 --> 00:46:33,754
- The beast is out there.
- He's gone off his tree.

524
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:36,452
- No.
- Professor Jordan.

525
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,762
- Just a taste now, sir.
- Oh.

526
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:44,824
Tell us what happened.

527
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:47,165
We came for the treasure.

528
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,467
Everyone said it was here.

529
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:52,334
Did you find it?

530
00:46:54,877 --> 00:46:56,811
All we found was death.

531
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:59,041
It's okay, Dad.
We're gonna get you home.

532
00:46:59,041 --> 00:46:59,761
Susan.

533
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,477
You look just like your mother.

534
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:07,683
There must be another way out
or a way to open this door.

535
00:47:07,683 --> 00:47:11,558
It's the stone...
they use it like a key.

536
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:14,995
I saw them.
Wilson went after it.

537
00:47:14,995 --> 00:47:16,498
Wilson's dead.

538
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:21,531
- Then it's over.
- No. Where is this circle stone?

539
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:26,339
What are you doing
out of your tent?

540
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,679
Dad. Dad, where is the stone?

541
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,753
The circle stone is in there?

542
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:02,269
I think I could take them from here.

543
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:05,007
Yes, and what will we do
when the rest come running?

544
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:12,444
There's another way.

545
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,751
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

546
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:19,644
- Man: That was great.
- Thain: Great?

547
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:22,283
- Now they know we're here.
- Jordan: They already know.

548
00:49:22,283 --> 00:49:24,520
That's not a barbecue.
That's a war party.

549
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,461
- We'll deal with them.
- Oh yeah? What about the beast?

550
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:30,590
- I'm not afraid of monsters.
- You will be... soon enough.

551
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,180
(roars)

552
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,049
No guards?

553
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:56,754
Those are the guards...

554
00:49:56,754 --> 00:49:59,352
protecting the entrance to the temple.

555
00:49:59,352 --> 00:50:01,863
I'll take these over
the ones out there any day.

556
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,467
(all scream)

557
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:07,867
(grunts, coughing)

558
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,603
I'm sorry.

559
00:50:12,603 --> 00:50:14,633
I'll get you out.

560
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,348
Uh...

561
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:30,353
- Here, get up.
- (grunting)

562
00:50:30,353 --> 00:50:32,020
Reach.

563
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,756
Reach!

564
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:35,923
I'm almost there.

565
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:39,030
Almost. That's it.

566
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,203
(panting, sighs)

567
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,276
It doesn't matter.

568
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:55,113
We're all gonna die.

569
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:57,986
We're all gonna die.

570
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:01,919
(whimpers)

571
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:07,928
All: Huh?

572
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,907
Help! Help me!

573
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,538
Help me, help me!

574
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:26,878
(screams)

575
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:29,214
(crunches)

576
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:34,446
(all shudder)

577
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:40,662
(Quetzalcoatl pants)

578
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,099
That is the end of mythology.

579
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,664
What the hell
was that thing up there?

580
00:51:50,664 --> 00:51:51,968
That's the beast.

581
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:54,533
It killed Isaac.
It just cut him in half.

582
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,410
- It killed all of them.
- Quetzalcoatl.

583
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,539
Susan:
Where is he?

584
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:02,210
He's taken his sacrifice.

585
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,220
- Let's see if there's a way out.
- Don't!

586
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,300
Thanks.

587
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:17,261
You can let me go now.

588
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:19,233
Yes, of course.

589
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:24,332
Why are we trading
our lives for his?

590
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:26,967
I didn't ask you to come.
You think I wanted my daughter here?

591
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,136
We're all here for our own reasons.

592
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:30,475
Why are you here again?

593
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:38,147
We can argue or we can try
and find a way out of here.

594
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,988
Uh, can't we just balance
some rocks again?

595
00:52:41,988 --> 00:52:44,356
- We'll climb out.
- What about the Aztecs?

596
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:47,089
I'll take my chances with them.

597
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:49,256
Oh no, that thing is up there.

598
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:51,926
- Langford: You'd rather stay down here?
- This rock...

599
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:53,832
we might be able to break through.

600
00:52:53,832 --> 00:52:55,928
Langford:
With what?

601
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:02,509
Give me a hand.

602
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:06,246
(men grunting)

603
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:21,319
- Who's first?
- I'm not going in there.

604
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:23,160
Would you rather die
now or later?

605
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,227
Please?

606
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:46,180
Are you all right?

607
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,816
I'm all right.
There's a tunnel here.

608
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:52,294
Wonderful. I'm sure no harm
will come to us there.

609
00:54:03,038 --> 00:54:05,165
Where did you get that knife?

610
00:54:05,165 --> 00:54:07,300
Oh, this.

611
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,743
It's something
my father gave me.

612
00:54:09,743 --> 00:54:12,941
I would have thought you had
dug it up in Tenochtitlan.

613
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:15,678
Ah, no, I've never been.

614
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:20,553
An Aztec expert who's never been
to the Aztec's capital.

615
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:23,524
Well, I've never even
been to Mexico.

616
00:54:23,524 --> 00:54:26,460
How do you become an Aztec scholar
without going to Mexico?

617
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,658
Walk and talk as if,
even though things are not.

618
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:32,758
- What?
- Something my father used to say.

619
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:34,928
You see, I was sick as a boy.

620
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:37,530
My father worked
a shipping boat in the Pacific.

621
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,837
Always brought me
something back.

622
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:44,107
He said that this knife belonged
to the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés.

623
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:46,376
That makes a lot of sense.

624
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:48,610
Yes, well, he probably made
the whole thing up,

625
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,846
but that is how I became
interested in the Aztecs.

626
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:53,946
With the knife of the man
who conquered them?

627
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:57,720
I'm afraid knives had nothing
to do with it.

628
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,786
See, as one myth goes,

629
00:55:00,786 --> 00:55:03,593
the god Quetzalcoatl was
defeated by a great warrior.

630
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,760
He was so ashamed that he built

631
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,067
a great fire,
dressed in his finest armor

632
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:12,437
and set himself on fire.

633
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:13,964
Vanished.

634
00:55:13,964 --> 00:55:18,742
When Cortés arrived, the Aztecs thought
it was the return of Quetzalcoatl.

635
00:55:18,742 --> 00:55:21,545
By the time they realized
how wrong they were,

636
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:25,452
it was too late. The Spanish
had destroyed their civilization.

637
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:28,320
- Man: Not entirely.
- (chuckles)

638
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,689
(growling)

639
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:38,295
(roars)

640
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:43,662
Wainwright: Anything in that book of
yours say how to kill a prehistoric god?

641
00:55:43,662 --> 00:55:46,698
We're not killing anything.
We're not going to disturb anything.

642
00:55:46,698 --> 00:55:49,734
We've stumbled onto a living
civilization and we must respect it.

643
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:52,440
We must get out of here and if that
means blowing some holes

644
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,073
in an Aztec god, I'm going to do it.

645
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:56,016
Yes, well,

646
00:55:56,016 --> 00:55:59,214
isn't that the spirit that has
caused two deaths now?

647
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:04,549
Was that your hardest punch?

648
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:07,486
Enough!

649
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:10,020
This beast is coming back.
I'm not going to stand here

650
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,226
and watch you knock
each other's teeth out.

651
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:14,463
Finish it later.

652
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,545
Tell me there's a way through.

653
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:27,071
There's always a way.

654
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:28,777
How long
are you going to be, Thain?

655
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:32,844
Yes, of course. It couldn't be simpler.
Put the stick in the right hole.

656
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:37,153
Langford:
Well, figure it out.

657
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:40,355
- The bird.
- Yes, of course, the symbol of freedom.

658
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,091
(clanking)

659
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:44,099
- (arrows whizz)
- (groaning)

660
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:48,934
Actually the Aztecs viewed birds
as deliverers of death.

661
00:56:48,934 --> 00:56:51,201
Langford:
Get your mythology straight.

662
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:52,935
There is no God.

663
00:56:52,935 --> 00:56:57,309
Langford: Evidence suggests otherwise,
just not the one we've been praying to.

664
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:59,371
Don't do that again.

665
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,774
Hold still.

666
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:04,445
(groans)

667
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:08,782
Curare poison...
he's going to suffocate.

668
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:11,759
- I'm gonna what?
- We've got bigger problems!

669
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:19,566
- (choking)
- What's wrong with him?

670
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:21,762
- Just keep him breathing.
- How?

671
00:57:21,762 --> 00:57:24,864
- He's dying.
- Is it contagious?

672
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,602
(clicks)

673
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:38,013
That's not the door to freedom.

674
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:40,487
That's the door
to Quetzalcoatl's room.

675
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,217
(rumbling)

676
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,453
- Get up!
- Well done.

677
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:47,985
Look out.

678
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,244
(shouting)

679
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:31,539
Breathe, Dunbar, breathe!

680
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:35,238
(gasps, coughs)

681
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:38,007
Susan: You're fine now.
You're fine.

682
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:45,945
What is this place?

683
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:48,354
This is where we lost everyone.

684
00:58:48,354 --> 00:58:49,880
The beast is in here.

685
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:53,286
It's an observatory.

686
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:56,661
The Aztecs were able to predict
the movements of the planets

687
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:58,427
as far back as the 13th century.

688
00:58:58,427 --> 00:59:01,095
Far more advanced
than Europe at the time.

689
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:04,367
If they are so advanced, why are
they cutting people's hearts out?

690
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:06,033
- (rock rumbling)
- Shh!

691
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,094
The stone... it's gotta be in there.

692
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:28,460
And the treasure.

693
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:34,527
We've got to take him out.

694
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,095
Dunbar, you stay here
with the women.

695
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:38,731
- Excuse me?
- That's fine with me.

696
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:40,264
No, I'm coming with you.

697
00:59:40,264 --> 00:59:42,641
Hildy, this is no time
for your damn women's suffrage.

698
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:44,908
It's bad enough that I have to go
in there with Dr. Parasol.

699
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:47,040
We can use all the help we can get.

700
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,642
But you should stay here...

701
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:52,119
to protect your father.

702
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,365
(woman screaming)

703
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:16,372
- (growling)
- (choking)

704
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:24,581
- Thank you.
- Yes, well...

705
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:27,885
- that was refreshing.
- Very good.

706
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,914
(tool thunks)

707
01:00:58,086 --> 01:01:00,646
Let's go, Dunbar.

708
01:01:00,646 --> 01:01:02,156
(moaning)

709
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:18,564
Wainwright:
Whoa. Amazing.

710
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,643
Thain:
Do not disturb anything.

711
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,742
I think we've paid our way.

712
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:32,185
This treasure belongs to them.
Do not disturb anything.

713
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:34,688
We're looking for the key...
a round, circular stone

714
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:37,385
with pictographs on it, large enough
to fit in the recess of that doorway...

715
01:01:37,385 --> 01:01:40,293
- and that is all.
- Suit yourself.

716
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,470
Susan.

717
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:57,137
Can I tell you something?

718
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:59,147
I used to follow you at night...

719
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:01,376
you know, when you thought
you were sneaking off.

720
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:03,509
I'd watch you for hours...

721
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,952
cataloguing your artifacts

722
01:02:06,952 --> 01:02:09,457
and making your lists.
(chuckles)

723
01:02:09,457 --> 01:02:11,686
It was the best part of my day.

724
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,388
Why didn't you tell me?

725
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:15,521
You were having too much fun.

726
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:18,158
Yes, but at least then
we could've been together.

727
01:02:18,158 --> 01:02:20,532
I wanted you to make
your own discoveries.

728
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:23,060
I wanted you
to be your own person.

729
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,164
I didn't want you
to just follow after me.

730
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:28,233
Dad, don't you know that
that's all I ever wanted?

731
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:31,643
Was to follow you,
to be just like you.

732
01:02:31,643 --> 01:02:33,910
Yeah, but you're
so much better than I am.

733
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:36,713
Besides, look what happened
when you followed me here.

734
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:38,379
You shouldn't have come.

735
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,388
How could I not come after you?

736
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:41,912
(sighs)

737
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:45,415
I don't think that I'm ever
meant to leave this place.

738
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:47,951
You always make it out.
You always come home.

739
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,827
Not this time.

740
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,696
You promise me something:

741
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:55,430
no matter what happens, you'll get out
of this place as quickly as you can.

742
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:59,930
I can't promise you that...
not if it means leaving you behind.

743
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,201
(metal clinking)

744
01:03:42,951 --> 01:03:44,942
I found it.

745
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:48,085
Dr. Jordan.

746
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:56,153
- Are you sure that's it?
- Jordan: Looks like it to me.

747
01:03:56,153 --> 01:03:58,792
I thought you said
you saw them use it.

748
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,561
I was shot in the leg.
I was in shock.

749
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:04,572
I was fighting for my life.

750
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:07,734
Professor, we've almost
gotten ourselves killed getting here.

751
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:10,438
- You have to be sure.
- Well, I'm as sure as I can be.

752
01:04:10,438 --> 01:04:13,004
- That's not good enough.
- It's gonna have to be.

753
01:04:13,004 --> 01:04:16,814
We can stand here and argue
or we can try and find a way out.

754
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:22,145
What is he doing?

755
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:36,960
- Did you hear?
- Ooh, yeah. Yes.

756
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,838
- Hildy found the stone.
- Yes.

757
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,105
I thought that
you would be more excited.

758
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:43,805
I am.

759
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,347
I've never really seen you
at a loss for words before.

760
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:51,181
Uh, yes, well,

761
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:54,052
- Umm...
- Did you forget why we were here?

762
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:56,250
I mean, we found my father,
we found the stone.

763
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,021
I did not come for your father, Susan.
I came for you.

764
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,921
What?

765
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,364
(sighs)

766
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:09,302
I know I'm not the best person
at expressing myself

767
01:05:09,302 --> 01:05:13,137
and perhaps that is why
I've chosen to surround myself

768
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:15,541
with artifacts
and relics rather than

769
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,442
things of flesh and blood.

770
01:05:19,147 --> 01:05:22,207
But I do understand one thing
and that is that I have loved you

771
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:24,275
the moment I laid eyes upon you.

772
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,588
And my one regret
is that I have waited

773
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:31,421
until this moment to tell you.

774
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:34,759
Now that we're facing death.

775
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:35,719
Perhaps.

776
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:40,292
That must have taken
a lot of courage to say.

777
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,132
Oh yes.

778
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:44,828
Well...

779
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:47,967
maybe that same courage will help
find us a way out of here.

780
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:55,078
Perhaps.

781
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,013
(thunder rumbling)

782
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,825
No, it can't be.

783
01:06:13,134 --> 01:06:15,261
(muffled yelling)

784
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:18,466
- Langford: What are you doing?
- He's as frightened as we are

785
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:20,406
and he'll know a way out of here.

786
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,775
(yelling)

787
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,484
(Quetzalcoatl growling)

788
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:40,756
- Hildy!
- (grunts)

789
01:06:40,756 --> 01:06:43,161
- Hildy!
- Susan: Hildy, open the door.

790
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:45,826
- Langford: What is she doing?
- All: Hildy?

791
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:51,462
Susan:
Hildy, open the door.

792
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:56,169
- Dad?
- (snarls)

793
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:05,112
Come on, big fella, come on.
Take me.

794
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,549
- Dad, no. No!
- Susan!

795
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:10,990
Come on!

796
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:15,525
- Dad, no!
- Go go! I'm fine.

797
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:19,162
Dad, no.

798
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,961
- Dad...
- Take care of her.

799
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:28,869
Open the door!

800
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:31,572
Langford?

801
01:07:31,572 --> 01:07:34,047
- No, stop!
- Susan, we have to go.

802
01:07:34,047 --> 01:07:37,609
- I'm not leaving him.
- Get as far away from here as possible.

803
01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:40,052
- I'll find Hildy.
- I'm not leaving him!

804
01:07:40,052 --> 01:07:41,749
Susan, he's gone.

805
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:44,691
Do not make this
a meaningless sacrifice. Now go!

806
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:47,194
Get going.

807
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,674
(shudders)

808
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:20,614
Get up, come on.

809
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,646
(moaning)

810
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:41,842
I'm sorry.

811
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:44,106
I'm so sorry.

812
01:09:44,106 --> 01:09:46,511
No! No, please.

813
01:09:48,516 --> 01:09:51,713
Come back.
Don't leave me.

814
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:53,880
(Aztecs shouting)

815
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:17,208
(gasps)

816
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:23,807
Where's Dunbar?

817
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,218
- They killed him.
- How...?

818
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:27,915
There's no time.

819
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:30,117
We gotta go. Let's go.

820
01:10:36,097 --> 01:10:38,190
(low grunting)

821
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:57,615
You stay here. I'm gonna go
check it out, okay?

822
01:10:57,615 --> 01:10:59,847
Just stay here.

823
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:08,760
(gasps)

824
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:13,327
(crowd hooting)

825
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:32,919
(hooting continues)

826
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:37,824
Well, it's been
nice knowing you, Hildy.

827
01:11:37,824 --> 01:11:39,918
You're all right for a woman.

828
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,244
(screams)

829
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,287
He's coming.

830
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,205
Susan:
They have Hildy.

831
01:12:33,915 --> 01:12:36,110
- Susan...
- I thought you said they killed Dunbar?

832
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,209
I didn't think that I could
carry him all the way.

833
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,448
- We have to go back for them.
- There are 500 Aztecs.

834
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:43,321
- We can't help them.
- Like you couldn't help in the sand?

835
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:45,690
- Or your team in the Amazon?
- Where are you going?

836
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,922
- To help our friends.
- No, Susan.

837
01:12:47,922 --> 01:12:50,863
Your father sacrificed himself
so I could get you out of here.

838
01:12:50,863 --> 01:12:54,265
I am trying to get you out of here.
Everything I do,

839
01:12:54,265 --> 01:12:56,998
- every choice that I've made...
- We have to help them.

840
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,404
Susan, please.
Please!

841
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:08,010
(groans, panting)

842
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:14,719
Somebody do something.

843
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:18,851
(speaking Aztec)

844
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,965
(knife thuds)

845
01:14:45,146 --> 01:14:47,307
(yells)

846
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,320
No!

847
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:22,615
(groans)

848
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,648
Look out!

849
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:27,614
(soft murmuring)

850
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:47,223
- How the hell did you do that?
- Shhh.

851
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:52,966
You still have the stone?

852
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,629
- Where's Langford?
- Dead.

853
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:30,068
He's figured it out, it won't be long
before the others do.

854
01:17:30,068 --> 01:17:32,306
So when I say run, we run.

855
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,384
- Dad?
- It can't be.

856
01:17:38,384 --> 01:17:39,784
But we saw him die.

857
01:17:39,784 --> 01:17:42,254
He sacrificed himself
and was allowed to live.

858
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:43,917
- Why?
- Because that's something

859
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:45,858
- Quetzalcoatl understands.
- Dad.

860
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:48,054
- No, we're leaving.
- What's the matter with you?

861
01:17:48,054 --> 01:17:49,960
- It's Dr. Jordan!
- I don't care who it is.

862
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,555
- I'm getting out of here.
- Stop it!

863
01:17:51,555 --> 01:17:53,726
Don't fight. It isn't godlike.

864
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:55,565
(Hildy screams)

865
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:39,778
- Dunbar: What's he doing?
- He's desecrating the temple.

866
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:41,748
For the love of God, why?

867
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:04,766
(snarling)

868
01:19:05,806 --> 01:19:07,068
(roaring)

869
01:19:08,943 --> 01:19:10,843
(crowd screaming)

870
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,855
(claws slice)

871
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,110
(hisses)

872
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,557
(screams)

873
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:45,131
(grunts)

874
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,866
- Open!
- (rock crumbling)

875
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:53,106
(screams)

876
01:20:58,419 --> 01:21:00,478
(hissing)

877
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,832
You've seen this before,
haven't you?

878
01:21:17,705 --> 01:21:20,435
(creaking)

879
01:21:20,435 --> 01:21:22,442
(snarls)

880
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,040
(moaning)

881
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:46,765
(panting)

882
01:22:01,315 --> 01:22:03,442
(shrieks)

883
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:28,398
(bird cawing)

884
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,120
Let them go.

885
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,431
What are you doing?

886
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,565
I don't know.

887
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:26,563
(speaks Aztec)

888
01:23:26,563 --> 01:23:28,625
Susan:
Let him go.

889
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:31,797
It's all right, just go.

890
01:23:31,797 --> 01:23:35,104
- What are you doing?
- Go now, while you can.

891
01:23:35,104 --> 01:23:36,473
I'm not leaving you here.

892
01:23:36,473 --> 01:23:38,705
You don't have a choice
and neither do I.

893
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:42,614
They think I'm their god now.

894
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:44,880
How long do you think
that's gonna work for you?

895
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,618
Walk and talk as if,

896
01:23:48,618 --> 01:23:51,489
even though things are not.

897
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:58,292
Please. Go.

898
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,260
I can't.

899
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:06,001
Please.

900
01:24:07,107 --> 01:24:09,337
Come on, dear.

901
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:24,618
- Dr. Thain?
- Yes, Ms. Jordan?

902
01:24:24,618 --> 01:24:26,649
Any word on my father?

903
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:29,424
Um, excuse me.

904
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:35,599
I'm not talking about the Smithsonian.
I'm talking about us.

905
01:24:35,599 --> 01:24:39,402
Don't be foolish. The desert
kills people... even the Indians.

906
01:24:39,402 --> 01:24:41,601
You wouldn't last
a day out there.

907
01:24:41,601 --> 01:24:44,202
Don't attribute your own
cowardice to the rest of us.

908
01:24:44,202 --> 01:24:46,644
Cowardice, is that...

909
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:52,543
Dr. Thain?

910
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:55,555
Isaac: Why did you come?
I thought it was too dangerous.

911
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:58,683
Academic curiosity.

912
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:05,293
I'm glad you're here.

913
01:25:05,293 --> 01:25:08,768
Normally you're in your tent
with your head in a book.

914
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:25,410
Oh... no no, I wasn't...

915
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,283
I was... I was sketching.

916
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:29,221
Not-not-not you.

917
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:31,724
The cliffside and the bird
flew over and...

918
01:25:31,724 --> 01:25:34,626
and, uh...

919
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:36,492
I'm sorry.

920
01:25:36,492 --> 01:25:37,997
The same time now.

921
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:42,392
Three, two, one.

922
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:47,605
Everyone down!

923
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:48,325
Don't!

924
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:53,370
Thanks.

925
01:25:55,549 --> 01:25:57,517
You can let me go now.

926
01:25:57,517 --> 01:26:00,019
Yes, of course.

927
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:06,024
I did not come for your father, Susan.
I came for you.

928
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:09,327
What?

929
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:12,059
I have loved you the moment
I laid eyes upon you.

930
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:18,561
And my one regret is that
I have waited until this moment

931
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:20,232
to tell you.

932
01:26:20,232 --> 01:26:22,834
That must have taken
a lot of courage to say.

933
01:27:01,715 --> 01:27:04,013
(birds chirping)

934
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,894
Jordan:
He'll be fine.

935
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:21,765
You keep on saying that,
but I know you don't believe it.

936
01:27:21,765 --> 01:27:24,202
Of course I do.
I stayed alive for days in there.

937
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:26,729
Hiding... and you had us to help.
He's all alone.

938
01:27:26,729 --> 01:27:29,537
And what about us?
We're gonna die out here in the desert.

939
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:33,905
- Run!
- Go.

940
01:27:41,688 --> 01:27:43,883
(Thain grunting)

941
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,132
I decided not to stay.

942
01:27:56,132 --> 01:28:00,573
- How did you get out?
- Well, I lit a huge bonfire,

943
01:28:00,573 --> 01:28:03,235
found the best armor I could
and then...

944
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:05,711
- set myself on fire.
- What?

945
01:28:05,711 --> 01:28:08,112
Well, actually
I set the armor on fire

946
01:28:08,112 --> 01:28:10,582
and ran like hell
while they were watching it burn.

947
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:12,983
But how did you get through the wall?

948
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:21,157
I believe this is yours.

949
01:28:21,157 --> 01:28:22,856
Mine?

950
01:28:22,856 --> 01:28:24,727
It was your discovery.

951
01:28:31,338 --> 01:28:32,771
(whistles)

952
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,797
(mule brays)

953
01:28:34,797 --> 01:28:36,570
(Susan laughs)

954
01:28:38,478 --> 01:28:40,844
Let's go home.

955
01:28:40,844 --> 01:28:43,748
(flute music playing)

956
