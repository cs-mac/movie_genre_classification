1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,436
AMBULANCE

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,119
<i>Tim, no matter what happens,</i>
<i>we stick to the plan, understand?</i>

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,511
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>it's gonna work, Frank.</i>

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>Then the plan</i>
<i>has to be followed exactly.</i>

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,634
<i>In. Out. Then straight</i>
<i>to Kiel with Mom. Got it?</i>

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,394
<i>- No shooting, no deaths.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,552
<i>Because I'm not</i>
<i>going back to prison.</i>

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,352
<i>I don't want you going through</i>
<i>the same shit I went through.</i>

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,038
<i>We get hold of the $25,000 and</i>
<i>tomorrow Mom will get her treatment.</i>

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,555
<i>This is her last chance.</i>

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,237
Look at me ...

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,756
This one's for Mom.

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,673
- For Mom, yes.
- Tim?

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,352
Are you sure about this?

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,916
- Okay ... Are you ready?
- Yes.

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,038
- Are you ready?
- Yeah! No shooting, no deaths.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,953
Right! Let's go.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,830
<i>This is a robbery!</i>

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>What're you doing?</i>
<i>No shooting, I said!</i>

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,555
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,228
Come out with your hands above
your head! The bank is surrounded!

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,473
- Fuck. The car! What do we do?
- Run ...! Run!

23
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,677
- Come on!
- Stop!

24
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,320
- Let's take this!
- What are you doing?

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,758
- It's an ambulance. You can't!
- What are we gonna do?

26
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,673
- Come on!
- Shit!

27
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,551
- What the hell happened in there?
- She set off the alarm.

28
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,278
I said there was to be no shooting!
That's the only thing I told you!

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,592
- Did they hit you?
- No ... That way! Go!

30
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,477
Can you steer with that cast?
Did you drop your gun?

31
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,553
- What do we do now?
- To the harbor! The getaway car.

32
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,553
You're too dumb
to be my brother.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,030
- It was just a warning shot.
- Watch out!

34
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,994
- Come on, man.
- Go now, god dammit!

35
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,636
- What are you doing?
- Is it enough?

36
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,836
It's plenty.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,151
No! What do we do now?

38
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,233
They're coming, Frank!
What do we do?

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,075
- What are you doing?
- Out of the car with your hands up!

40
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,631
- The siren. Find the siren.
- Brilliant, Frank!

41
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,753
- Don't turn that shit on.
- Get out, hands over your head!

42
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,795
- That's it!
- Jesus ... It works!

43
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,918
- This is a great getaway car.
- It glows in the dark.

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,517
It's the worst getaway car
you could find. You clown!

45
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,709
Yeah! They're stopping!

46
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,513
- And the getaway car?
- A Volvo S-80.

47
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,959
I stole it out in the suburbs.
It's hidden where we arranged.

48
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,037
<i>A-95 ... A-95 ... Come in!</i>

49
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,710
<i>Come in ... Who are you?</i>
<i>Stop the ambulance immed ...</i>

50
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,234
What are you doing?

51
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,992
<i>... visual contact with ambulance.</i>
<i>Request reinforcements ...</i>

52
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,915
<i>There are 3 cars on their way to</i>
<i>the roadblock at South Harbor Plaza.</i>

53
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,278
South Harbor Plaza ...
Okay ... Turn there! Come on!

54
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,390
<i>They're headed along Vasby</i>
<i>to Ring Road ll. Over.</i>

55
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,113
<i>The ambulance is probably</i>
<i>on Tømmergrav Street, or else ...</i>

56
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,114
We've got to get around
the roadblock. There! Left!

57
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,989
No, left!
Haven't you learned it yet?

58
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,113
"Right, left, right, left"!

59
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,238
- Good ... Straight ahead.
- How'd you know about the radio?

60
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,073
I don't want
to go back to prison again.

61
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,549
- Cool!
- No, it's just what you do ...

62
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,508
- Until you're busted again.
- <i>If</i> you're busted.

63
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,877
Tim, you <i>promise</i> me
you won't learn to love this.

64
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,634
Sure.

65
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,553
- What?
- <i>Yes!</i>

66
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,550
Spoiled little brat.

67
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,436
Yes. We are here.

68
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,716
Drive in there.

69
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,795
- I hope you got us a decent car.
- Don't worry, it's new.

70
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,877
<i>Svanholm, come in. Answer.</i>

71
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,508
Give me that walkie-talkie.

72
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,549
<i>Come in, Svanholm. Answer.</i>

73
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,915
Give me that walkie-talkie!

74
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,391
<i>Come in ...</i>

75
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,074
<i>Come in, Svanholm.</i>

76
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,791
Don't look in there! Don't let them
see our faces. Come on!

77
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,239
- Where's the car?
- It's over here.

78
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,996
No. This isn't
fucking happening, Tim!

79
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,516
I just parked it here!
Who'd steal a stolen car?

80
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,309
The only thing I asked you
was to get us a car!

81
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,471
What do we do?
The ambulance!

82
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,918
<i>Throw down your weapons!</i>
<i>All the exits are covered!</i>

83
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,039
Open that door.
Open that door, I said!

84
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,111
Shit!

85
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,239
Open!

86
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,312
Come on, Frank!

87
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,509
We're surrounded.
What the hell are we gonna do?

88
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,711
What're you doing?
What are you doing?!

89
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,471
Do something about her!

90
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,838
- Give me your hands.
- I'm sorry. I won't do anything.

91
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,233
- He's had a heart attack.
- Bring your hands here ...! Come on.

92
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,558
Do you have a cell phone?
Do you have a cell phone?!

93
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,234
No, I ... No!

94
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,871
- What do you call this, then?
- He needs intensive treatment!

95
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,077
No! No!

96
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,118
No! Stop!

97
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,834
No! Help me! Untie me!

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,037
Fuck!
What's happening here?

99
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,115
Shut up back there!

100
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,236
Fuck!

101
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,434
Yes, man!

102
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,953
As a getaway car, it's pretty okay.
With sirens and all ...

103
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,672
Shut up! We make a robbery in 2 days.
We should have prepared for 2 weeks.

104
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,389
What the hell
did you have in mind? Wait?

105
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,279
In two weeks she'll be dead!

106
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,991
- The IV drip's running out! Untie me!
- Can't you keep your mouth shut?

107
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,513
What's your name?

108
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,194
What's your name?!

109
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,114
- Julie.
- You have to let us do our job here.

110
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,593
The doctor was coming when you ...
No! Stop that! I'm only a nurse.

111
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,752
No! You can't do this!

112
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,597
Honestly, Frank, what are we going
to do? He's lying back there, dying.

113
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,354
- Get another car.
- What?

114
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,114
That one over there.
Take that one.

115
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,910
I need your car. Get out!

116
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,198
No, no. Just get out.

117
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,318
Easy.
Easy movements. Calm down.

118
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,357
Just get out now.

119
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,469
"MOM"

120
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,869
Sorry, I just have to take this ...

121
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,918
- Mother ...? What?
<i>- I can't breathe.</i>

122
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,594
- Can't breathe?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

123
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,911
Help!
They've stolen the ambulance!

124
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,470
- You want me out?
- Mom, we'll be there fast as possible.

125
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,712
They've stolen the ambulance!
Help!

126
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,519
- What's happening? A problem?
- Shut up!

127
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,955
- What about her?
- Fuck her! Come!

128
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,192
You can't leave without me
or else he'll die!

129
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,477
- Come on, god dammit!
- Okay. Jump in.

130
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,116
- What the hell? On the phone?
- It was Mother.

131
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,352
She can't breathe.

132
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,397
God dammit.

133
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,554
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- The map. Where are we?

134
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,792
We're ... here.

135
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,111
We'll take small roads
down to the boat.

136
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,999
Turn back.
He has to get to the hospital.

137
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,276
Straight ahead.
One kilometer.

138
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,594
His blood pressure is under 1 00.
His heart could stop at any time!

139
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,671
- Are you not listening?
- What now?

140
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,717
Just keep driving straight.

141
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,792
How long will it take
to get to Mom's place?

142
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,839
How should I know
if I don't know where we are?

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,116
Look, there's a sign.

144
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,114
Look ... Look at this.
This is a human being.

145
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,636
- Don't look at it.
- See here ... See here!

146
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,873
Today's his birthday.
The whole family was there.

147
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,793
He was opening presents
and he collapsed.

148
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,520
There they are again.

149
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,394
How the hell
can those cops <i>do</i> it?

150
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,598
A GPS ...
There must be a GPS somewhere.

151
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,957
- GPS?
- The cops can find us if we have one.

152
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,155
Find it!

153
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,190
Look around the radio. Break it open.
You'd think I had a GPS up my ass.

154
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,397
I just get out
and I'm up to my neck in no time!

155
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,711
- Is this it?
- No. Pull it out, dammit!

156
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,078
What's that in the back?
That thing, there.

157
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,993
- Come on.
- Jesus ...

158
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,391
That's it. Let me see ...

159
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,557
That's it.

160
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,598
No, no, no!
Don't let them see us.

161
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,154
See that truck over there?
Throw it in the back when we go by.

162
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,552
- But it'll hit those cows.
- Who cares. Throw it!

163
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,718
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,110
- Yes, man!
- All right!

165
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,548
You're a genius, Frank.

166
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,518
I've had practice. For five years.

167
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,317
And eight years of "higher
education" at the state prison.

168
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,070
- Should we throw them out?
- We don't have the time.

169
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,552
- We need another car.
- He's regained consciousness.

170
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,277
- Where are we?
- On the way to the hospital.

171
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,750
- Just relax. What's your name?
- Ejvind.

172
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,911
Ejvind, we'll make sure ...

173
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,232
- Where's Sarah?
- She's on her way to the hospital.

174
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,914
Where are the children?

175
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,598
They've been notified. They'll be
at the hospital. Just take it easy.

176
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,029
Easy, Ejvind ... Everything will be
okay ... when we get to the hospital.

177
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,114
That's why you should
keep away from this kind of thing.

178
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,271
<i>All units: Ambulance A-95 last seen</i>
<i>at the intersection of Køge Road.</i>

179
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,235
<i>Check Lellinge area. The army</i>
<i>has put a helicopter at your disposal.</i>

180
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,758
- A helicopter?
- Jesus, it's right here.

181
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,877
Fuck. There it is!

182
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,912
The forest!

183
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,519
- No!
- Can you see it?

184
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,994
No!

185
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,071
He's falling out!

186
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,708
Stop! No!

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,509
- Shut up!
- Stop! Stop!

188
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,357
What are you doing?

189
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,476
No!

190
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,949
- Stop! I can't hold him!
- Shut up!

191
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,588
- Frank ...
- He's falling out!

192
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,712
Untie me! Untie me!

193
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,111
- What are you doing?
- Easy, Frank!

194
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,670
- What the hell are you doing?
- Come on ...

195
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,997
- That's it.
- I have him!

196
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,788
Keep on holding him!

197
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,714
What happened to your arm?

198
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,389
Is it broken?

199
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,830
Well?

200
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,039
It was the security guards.

201
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,115
- They broke it.
- She's just trying to make you talk.

202
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,269
My mother ...

203
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,113
Our mother ...

204
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,316
... is about to die.

205
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,632
Cancer. She's only 56.

206
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,669
They've given her up.
"You've only got two weeks left."

207
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,479
Two weeks!
"We can't do any more for you."

208
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,599
Who can stand to hear something
like that? I wouldn't leave.

209
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,957
So they called security
and that's why ...

210
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,558
- Jesus Christ, man!
- The operation is $25,000 in Kiel.

211
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,392
Shut up!

212
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,189
That's what it'll cost
at a private hospital.

213
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,989
You ... You have to help me.

214
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,948
I've never done this alone before.
It's not his fault that ...

215
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,430
Are you the one
getting treatment now?

216
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,592
- I need your help.
- Get out of there, dammit!

217
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,832
Frank, you're gonna have to ...

218
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,878
He's about to die back there!

219
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,157
He's going to die!
He can't survive this!

220
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,676
- We get life in prison if he dies.
- 10 years. Not life.

221
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,354
- You've got to ...
- Got to what?

222
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,035
Mom's dying!
Ten years or life, what do I care?

223
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,077
I just got out of prison.

224
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,234
Sonja and I have just had the bandit.
I want to be a father to him.

225
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,358
He's going to get to know
his grandmother, too.

226
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,308
We're going to be a family now.
<i>All</i> of us.

227
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,710
This is our last chance.

228
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,309
He's dead! He's dead!

229
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,153
Stop the car!

230
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,875
He died!

231
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,191
Give me your hands.

232
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,639
We only have four minutes!

233
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,632
And I don't know this equipment.
This is my third time out.

234
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,268
There's a specific procedure ...

235
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,194
- Call the hospital ...
- The cops can trace us!

236
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,997
He's dead, Frank!

237
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,755
Here ... Don't call the cops.

238
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,591
Hello ...? Give me the
National Hospital trauma center. Fast!

239
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,995
My name? I'm standing here with a
heart attack victim. Give me a doctor!

240
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,110
It's a heart attack!
There's no pulse, no breathing.

241
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,113
I don't know what to do.
I can't ...

242
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,670
Easy, Frank. Easy!

243
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,471
I lost the connection!

244
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,710
Close the door! Hurry!

245
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,476
Yes, I should what ...?
No, there's no pulse at all.

246
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,356
Hello?

247
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,557
I can't ...
It takes two people.

248
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,996
<i>Isn't there someone</i>
<i>who can help you?</i>

249
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,794
Okay ...
Okay, just wait a moment ...

250
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,550
Are you going to help me?

251
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,394
Are you?

252
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,553
Unpack this. Hurry. There's
supposed to be electrodes inside.

253
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,271
These. They have to be attached
here. Come here and help.

254
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,353
It goes up there.
Take that tape-backing off.

255
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,199
Up there. There.

256
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,792
Then ... we turn it on here ...

257
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,558
They're on now. Yes.
Get away! Don't touch the stretcher.

258
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,472
I'm not!

259
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,313
<i>Don't touch the stretcher.</i>

260
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,357
<i>- Defibrillating ...</i>
- Yes ...

261
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,158
What's happening?

262
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,518
He's not responding ...

263
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,148
What should I do?

264
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,550
<i>His last chance</i>
<i>is a shot of adrenaline.</i>

265
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,280
In the heart?

266
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,591
Take some
of those cleaning pads.

267
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,070
- These?
- No. The small ones.

268
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,550
- And an ampule ...
- Hold this.

269
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,553
And clean ...
What? I have the syringe.

270
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,759
What's written on it?
Just adrenaline.

271
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,835
Okay, I'll make him ready ...
You just clean his chest, okay?

272
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,355
- How much?
- That's fine.

273
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,474
Everything's ready.
What should I do?

274
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,316
Just hold this for me.
For <i>me</i> ! What'd you say?

275
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,517
About 4 centimeters
from the middle. Okay.

276
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,435
How can I know if it's straight?
Yes, I'll mark it now.

277
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,475
Okay ... I should what?

278
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,555
I've never tried this before ...
Okay. I'll do it now.

279
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,189
Hold him.

280
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,272
- All the way through?
- Yes.

281
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,394
Come on ... Come on ...

282
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,712
It's beating! It's beating!

283
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,678
Yes!

284
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,513
Where's the phone?
It worked!

285
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,309
Yes ... yes ...
This is fantastic!

286
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,031
Yes, okay, the mask goes on.
Give me the mask.

287
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,595
Yes, it's beating regularly.
Yes ... Thank you.

288
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,433
<i>Get him</i>
<i>to the hospital immediately.</i>

289
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,989
Good. Now we'll ...

290
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,073
Well done.

291
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,152
<i>A-95 ... Do we have contact?</i>

292
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,392
Okay, we've got to move on.
Get him out.

293
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,553
What? He has to
get to the hospital now.

294
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,556
Get them out. We don't have the time.
This isn't the Red Cross.

295
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,917
Watch out for the drip.

296
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,073
- Listen ...
<i>- A-95, come in.</i>

297
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,953
- You've painted the ambulance.
- Isn't it pretty?

298
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,430
He's got to go to the hospital.
Did you see what happened?

299
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,478
We brought him back to life.

300
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,519
I think we can find
a little hospital along the way.

301
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,796
What are you talking about?

302
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,272
Didn't you see that helicopter?
Didn't you say Mom couldn't breathe?

303
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,954
<i>A-95, come in.</i>

304
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,558
We can use them as hostages
if the police will negotiate.

305
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,953
You keep your mouth shut
and take out that stretcher, Tim.

306
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,559
- You do as I say!
- Ow, my arm!

307
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,269
- I'm your own brother!
- It's for your own sake.

308
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,070
- You can't do this to me!
- It's Mother or him. Understand?

309
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,800
What the hell are you doing?

310
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,589
Are you sick in the head?

311
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,716
Get that stretcher out!

312
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,996
Get that stretcher out!

313
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,032
- Do you hear me?
<i>- A-95. Are the hostages unharmed?</i>

314
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,280
- We need help ...
- Stop or I'll smash your head with it!

315
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,954
Help with that stretcher!
Get moving!

316
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,156
- Take that end.
- Get him out!

317
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,709
Hit it, hit it!

318
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,598
Get it out.

319
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,398
Get away.

320
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,916
Stop! The mask.
He'll die without oxygen!

321
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,197
- Bring it with him.
- I can't. It's attached.

322
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,239
Don't do that! Don't. Stop!

323
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,877
There's only one reserve
oxygen flask. There's only ...

324
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,758
... 25 minutes left.

325
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,311
Our mother was given 2 weeks. It's
a drag when people give up on you.

326
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,074
25 minutes.
That's cold-blooded murder!

327
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,509
We'll call an ambulance for you after
we've left. You just stay here.

328
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,557
Get this out of the way.

329
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,554
- No. They'll never find us here.
- We're going now.

330
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,792
He won't make it! No! Wait!

331
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,033
You can't go.
There's only 25 minutes of oxygen!

332
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,797
Tim, you can't do it!
He'll die! He'll die! Don't leave!

333
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,719
<i>A-95, are we in contact?</i>

334
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,838
<i>A-95, come in. We have to know</i>
<i>if the hostages are unharmed.</i>

335
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,713
What the hell
is happening with you?

336
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,717
- I can't do this. Can't you see?
- See what?

337
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,517
I don't believe it. We've only been
at it 40 minutes and you're crying.

338
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,672
- I'm calling.
- We have to get out of the area first.

339
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,234
To the right, over there.

340
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,119
To the right, god dammit!

341
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,110
How the hell did you take care
of Mom all the years I was gone?

342
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,956
I was there, at least.

343
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,194
- Why are you wearing that jacket?
- What do you mean?

344
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,309
That's the one Father had on
when he had his accident, you idiot.

345
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,911
Put your seat belt on.
You don't understand a damn thing.

346
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,188
Fuck!

347
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,158
This is too much.

348
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,034
There's a gas station down here.
Keep going straight.

349
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,478
Through town
to the gas station. There!

350
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,949
Cry baby.

351
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,713
- Gas or diesel?
- Wait a second ... Diesel.

352
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,553
God dammit, man!

353
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,917
Just wait. We'll stay here.

354
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,716
He's only got 19 minutes left.
I'm calling.

355
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,714
No phone calls
until we're on the road again.

356
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,317
What had you thought of telling Mom?
That we'd won the lottery?

357
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,755
I'll think of something.

358
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,269
We should take that one.

359
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,750
That's a 2CV, Tim.
It does 80 kph, at the most.

360
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,869
It's only getaway car
that's worse than this piece of shit.

361
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,638
That little one there.
He looks like my son.

362
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,552
We'll be playing
football before long.

363
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,836
How long can it take to fill
the tank on that baby stroller?

364
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,755
It's Mother.

365
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,879
Hi ... What?
Are you breathing better?

366
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,873
Come on, she's leaving.
Go!

367
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,189
What?
No, I'm not with him.

368
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,834
Listen ... You just have
to be ready at one o'clock.

369
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,309
Because we're going to Kiel.

370
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,758
Don't worry about that.
We'll all go together.

371
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,196
Just get
your things packed and then ...

372
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,876
Wait a second, Mother ...

373
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,553
- What the fuck ...
- Come on, children.

374
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,192
No, there's nothing wrong. Just be
ready. We're coming at one o'clock!

375
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,749
See you, Mother. Bye.

376
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,197
- Watch out. There might be a bump.
- Did she ask if I was there?

377
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,032
Frank, she ...

378
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,395
Why'd she do that?

379
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,599
She doesn't want
anything to happen to anyone.

380
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,959
I knew it! That dumb bitch
is fucking everything up again!

381
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,632
"Dumb bitch"? Mother?

382
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,837
Is it Mother
you're talking about?

383
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,198
If you think she's a dumb bitch,
why are you doing this at all?

384
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,953
I'm going to call now.

385
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,199
Hello ...?
We need an ambulance.

386
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,875
A heart attack ...

387
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,273
The address ...? Mine?

388
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,115
Oh, the address of the accident.
Find it on the map!

389
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,717
- Relax.
- We're trying to find it on the map.

390
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,472
- We drove off the map.
- What?

391
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,995
What's the name of that forest?

392
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,913
- I don't know.
- What do we do now?

393
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,790
Listen, it's in a forest that ...

394
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,158
Yes, I ...
Fuck, man, what are we gonna do?

395
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,232
- He's got 13 minutes left.
- Listen ...

396
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,358
It's not our fault
he's had a heart attack.

397
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,308
He's going to die anyway.
Don't you get it?

398
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,516
We're here now!

399
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,912
- Aren't we?
- We're going back, Frank.

400
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,672
We're going back.

401
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,798
No, we're not.

402
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,358
Mother's five minutes away.
We'll pick up my car.

403
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,436
Then we drive to the harbor, get on
the boat and we're back on schedule.

404
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,390
Frank?

405
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,950
Jesus.

406
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,711
Fuck.

407
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,670
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, don't!

408
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,799
Everything's under control.
Nothing happened. I'm okay.

409
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,714
- You should go to the hospital.
- It's okay. Just go.

410
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,159
We ... Me and my brother
were doing a little drinking, so ...

411
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,278
Just go. Thanks, anyway.

412
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,831
- I'll just call ...
- Just go! Can't you just leave?

413
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,995
- You should see yourself.
- Leave now, dammit!

414
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,590
Are you okay, Frank?

415
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,073
- Are you okay?
- Get back ... Yeah, I ...

416
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,719
What the fuck happened?

417
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,676
- What happened to your forehead?
- Sorry, Frank. We have to go back.

418
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,595
Take it easy. You've fucked up
enough. Take a look at that car.

419
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,958
- You'll have to drive.
- What are you talking about?

420
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,315
I mean it.

421
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,668
We can't just let him die.

422
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,273
What the hell are you doing?
Threatening your own brother?

423
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,831
Get that branch out,
then get in, and we're leaving.

424
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,312
Get in the car! Get that branch out
and we're out of here!

425
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,795
Get in and we're leaving!

426
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,475
Start the car.

427
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,715
This project ...

428
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,916
- It's just ...
- Try again.

429
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,070
- This is unbelievable.
- Turn the car around.

430
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,310
Tim ...

431
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,276
You don't mean that.
What's happening to you?

432
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,319
To me? No one dead, remember?
That wasn't part of the plan.

433
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,517
The plan stopped
when you fired a shot in that bank.

434
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,638
We're driving back
to pick them up.

435
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,510
We'll find some local hospital.
And then we'll leave again.

436
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,990
Last time you pointed a gun at me,
it was a water pistol. Remember?

437
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,230
You don't have
the nerve to shoot, do you?

438
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,198
Do you have the nerve?
Huh, Tim?

439
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,712
Do you?

440
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,718
Point that away, okay?
We might drive over a bump.

441
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,958
Jesus, Timmy,
we shouldn't be fighting.

442
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,875
Now we're all going to be a family.
You and me and Mother, right?

443
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,396
We'll catch that boat
and just sail away.

444
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,189
When Mom's well
we'll start all over.

445
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,432
- All of us.
- We'll do all that, too ...

446
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,354
Afterwards.

447
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,830
I saved his life.
I can't just abandon him.

448
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,831
Hold on ...
That's not your lunch, is it?

449
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,436
- I need some sugar.
- I can't believe this!

450
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,878
It wasn't Mom who packed
that lunch for you, was it?

451
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,873
Jesus ... How much
does she know about this?

452
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,750
Nothing. She thinks
I'm at the job training class.

453
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,989
Don't eat that now.

454
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,194
Put it away.

455
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,194
She stopped making my lunches
after the accident.

456
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,828
What are you talking about?

457
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,073
What's this got to do
with the accident? I'm hungry.

458
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,629
Put that food away.

459
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,114
- Turn here.
- This is pure suicide!

460
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,034
You shut up.
There's two minutes left!

461
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,916
It's her ...

462
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,394
Stop!

463
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,998
We've come to fetch you.
We'll drive to the hospital.

464
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,549
Come on, jump in!

465
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,918
There's no more oxygen.
His lips are completely blue.

466
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,796
Come!

467
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,708
Further in, further in!

468
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,236
Further!

469
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,673
Will he make it?

470
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,115
Where are we?

471
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,151
- Is he okay?
- Yes. It was just in time.

472
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,396
What happened?

473
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,918
It was just a branch.
Let's get the stretcher into the van.

474
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,790
You've got to stop that bleeding.
Otherwise you'll pass out.

475
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,758
- The stretcher ...
- He can wait a second.

476
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,879
He has oxygen.
You mustn't lose more blood.

477
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,715
- Let's get going.
- We've got to take care of this.

478
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,758
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

479
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,115
I'll try to be careful.

480
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,076
No!

481
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,355
Can't I even go piss?

482
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,478
Come on, Julie,
we've got to hurry.

483
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,912
Were you the one
who made him come back?

484
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,275
Yeah.

485
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,350
- What an idiot he is.
- It's my brother you're talking about.

486
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,957
You don't know the shit
he's been through since Father died.

487
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,111
Your father? When?

488
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,672
14 years ago.

489
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,789
It was on a motorcycle.
He and Frank were out taking a ride.

490
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,714
That's how he got
that scar on his forehead.

491
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,750
Father's death hit him hard.

492
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,118
Then he went to prison ...
Seven robberies.

493
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,955
They locked him up
for eight years.

494
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,749
I think he's trying
to make things good again now.

495
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,354
There ... I'll just wipe this off.

496
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,715
Give me your hand.

497
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,149
There ... You have to hold this
drip up. You've lost a lot of blood.

498
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,235
Ow! My arm's hurt.
I can't hold it. Just hold that.

499
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,915
- What?
- Hold this. Come on, take the gun!

500
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,920
What are you doing, man?

501
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,473
We've got to get going now.

502
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,432
We have to get
the stretcher into the car.

503
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,991
Which local hospital
can take care of him?

504
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,200
- Næstved Hospital.
- Næstved ...

505
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,670
Okay, grab the stretcher.
We're going now.

506
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,319
Give me the money.
I'll take care of Mother.

507
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,478
What are you talking about?
We're not splitting up now.

508
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,710
This is just a little detour.

509
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,237
Can't you see how much trouble
you've already caused me?

510
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,354
Frank ... I'm your brother.
And we two help each other.

511
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,796
Help?
By driving me into a tree?

512
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,316
And then shoot at me afterwards.
Is that help?

513
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,550
No, but ...

514
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,754
- Tim ...
- Shut up.

515
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,598
This is
a totally ridiculous plan ...

516
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,239
... but we'll do it.

517
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,314
Come on,
let's get that stretcher in.

518
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,111
Watch out here ...

519
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,635
Come on, lift!

520
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,749
Push over there.

521
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,759
Here's your drip.

522
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,280
Is he okay back there?

523
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,274
I think he'll make it
to the hospital.

524
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,317
- What now?
- I've got to piss.

525
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,392
- Now?
- You wouldn't let me before.

526
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,631
Frank?

527
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,317
Hello?

528
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,270
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

529
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,950
Can you hear us? This is ... A-95,
the ambulance. Can you hear us?

530
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,878
<i>Hello, A-95. Come in.</i>

531
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,589
- Can you connect us with the police?
- That's enough!

532
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,198
- Give it to me! I've got an idea.
<i>- Just a moment. Stay in contact.</i>

533
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,192
<i>This is the police.</i>
<i>Bjørn Egelund.</i>

534
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,433
We're planning to deliver
the patient at Næstved Hospital -

535
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,989
- on condition of immunity.

536
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,835
<i>We need to know</i>
<i>if the two hostages are safe.</i>

537
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,154
They are. But they won't be unless
you give us immunity to Næstved.

538
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,118
<i>Næstved ... Wait ...</i>

539
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,911
<i>- We don't negotiate with terrorists.</i>
- Terrorists? What do you mean?

540
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,995
<i>I must know the hostages are alive</i>
<i>before we can negotiate.</i>

541
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,833
<i>Let me speak with one of them.</i>

542
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,991
You're not giving her this!

543
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,720
Trust me, Frank ...

544
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,077
Okay, I'm grabbing it back
if she squeals.

545
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,869
Don't say anything
about where we are. Got it?

546
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,230
Just hold that button in.

547
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,790
I know.

548
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,830
- Hello.
<i>- Bjørn Egelund.</i>

549
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,831
<i>With whom am I speaking?</i>

550
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,468
- Julie Svanholm.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

551
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,670
I'm fine, and these aren't terrorists.
They're just normal ...

552
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,833
- That's enough!
- She's doing fine, as you can hear.

553
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,595
<i>- And the patient?</i>
- He's sleeping.

554
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,878
<i>You're looking at 3 years now.</i>
<i>If anyone dies, you get life.</i>

555
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,795
<i>We've set in all our resources,</i>
<i>you're driving in an ambulance ...</i>

556
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,633
- Do we have a deal?
<i>- Deal?</i>

557
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,916
Yes. Immunity to Næstved.

558
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,034
<i>Wait ...</i>

559
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,875
<i>- Yes, immunity. Free the hostages.</i>
- You don't believe him, do you?

560
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,349
Stop here.

561
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,513
- Right.
- Left.

562
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,956
- What?
- You mean "right", don't you?

563
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,157
What are you talking about?

564
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,710
There's Næstved.
And there's Fakse.

565
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,236
There's a hospital
in Fakse, too.

566
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,920
How about that!

567
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,629
How the hell did
you know that, Timmy?

568
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,995
I learned to read.

569
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:11,110
That's my little brother speaking.
Tim Elo Hansen. Way to go, my boy!

570
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,035
<i>... Næstved Hospital will be</i>
<i>discreetly surrounded in 10 minutes.</i>

571
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,796
- They fell for it!
- "Discreetly surrounded"!

572
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,592
Tim?
Tim, are you okay?

573
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:52,154
Did your drip run out? Let me see ...
Yes. I'll just take this out.

574
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,471
- Tim ...
- Tim? Are you okay?

575
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,871
Hey ... Are you there?

576
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,032
Come here.
Take deep breaths.

577
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,469
Is it helping?

578
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,069
Hey, that's great ...

579
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,757
Don't you want some?

580
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,629
- No, thanks.
- Come on. It really works.

581
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,750
You're almost 40. You've been
in a serious traffic accident.

582
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:50,119
You need some, too.
Come on, try it.

583
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,430
Okay, give it to me, then.

584
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,718
- Wow!
- Keep your eyes on the road.

585
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,155
Give me one more.

586
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,590
Too much can get you stoned.

587
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,035
- Boy, does this stuff work!
- It's good, isn't it?

588
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,274
Focus, Tim!
Everything's under control. Wow!

589
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,959
You're an angel.

590
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,751
You don't happen to be interested
in my spoiled-brat little brother?

591
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,118
- Who can't score girls?
- That's enough, Frank.

592
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,389
Hey, your lunch!
Shouldn't we have a little sandwich?

593
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,710
Oh, good idea ...

594
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,878
26 years old and Mother still
makes your lunches. That's far out.

595
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,995
It's been quite a while.

596
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,551
Oh ... I'm sorry.
Won't you have one?

597
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,075
Well ... Yes.

598
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,357
Our mother made them for us.

599
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,391
Well, this isn't
supposed to be a picnic.

600
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,795
- Where's that hospital?
- What's this street?

601
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,190
Ask her.

602
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,955
Hey, excuse me.
Do you know the way to the hospital?

603
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,669
Yes ... Straight ahead
and then make a left.

604
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,992
Thank you.
Straight ahead and then to the left.

605
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,276
It should be down here ...

606
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,788
<i>All entries to Næstved Hospital are</i>
<i>covered. Ready for ambulance.</i>

607
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,032
Næstved!
Boy, are they gullible.

608
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,158
How far is it to Mom
from the hospital?

609
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,959
We have to go back
20 or 30 kilometers.

610
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,634
Ten minutes if Frank drives.

611
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,756
There it is!

612
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,719
We'll make the boat.
Tomorrow Mother will be in treatment.

613
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,111
Dammit, Frank,
we're going to make it.

614
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,874
What did you expect?

615
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,071
Where does one deliver
someone like him?

616
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,233
The ambulance
entrance is ... there. There!

617
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,517
What the hell are you doing?

618
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,759
I guess it's about time ...
to say goodbye.

619
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,597
I'm sorry about all this.

620
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,392
What the hell was that?

621
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,596
Jesus Christ, Frank!
What do we do?

622
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,354
No! No!

623
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,556
Stop!

624
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,278
Stop the car!

625
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,477
- Stop! Stop!
- Fuck him!

626
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,949
Stop! Stop!

627
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,593
No! The money!

628
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,476
I'm driving now!

629
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,349
What are you doing?

630
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,751
Give me those keys.
Give me those keys!

631
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,599
- Tim!
- He's stuck!

632
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,989
- What are you doing?
- He's stuck.

633
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,119
- We're leaving.
- Throw down your weapons!

634
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,391
I'll blow her head off!

635
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,639
Give me those keys, Tim!
I mean it, god dammit!

636
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:28,477
- He'll fall out. It's murder.
- Drop your weapons!

637
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,552
- No!
- Don't do that.

638
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,394
- No!
- That's not going to work.

639
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,438
Hear the pulse gauge.
He'll die!

640
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,192
<i>The area is surrounded!</i>

641
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,909
We're surrounded.
We might as well give ourselves up.

642
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,197
Couldn't we try
and get a doctor out here?

643
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,318
I'm so tired
of your ridiculous ideas.

644
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,392
I'm not going back to prison.

645
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,755
I'm going home to my son.

646
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,196
Now give me those keys.
I'll count to three.

647
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,635
- One!
If you drive away, Frank ...

648
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,633
... you'll be shot.

649
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,712
You'll wreck your own life
as well as his.

650
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,873
The bandit's life. Sonja's.
Is that what you want?

651
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,836
Give me that.
We're finished, anyway.

652
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,879
- Why do you ...
- Stop! Don't come any closer.

653
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,270
Two!

654
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,831
Give me that pistol.
Do you want to ruin everything?

655
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,879
Ruin everything ...? Me?

656
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,560
Suddenly
everything's my fault, huh?

657
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,190
I'm doing this for our sake.
If we leave ...

658
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,476
What the hell are you doing?

659
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,313
You've always ruined
everything for me!

660
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,516
Always!

661
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,798
This isn't
just about those keys, is it?

662
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,589
- We're brothers, we can't ...
- We can't what?

663
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,472
Don't come around telling me
what to do and what not to do.

664
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,235
You and Mother, man. You two.

665
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,039
You're so damn ...

666
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,715
What are you talking about?

667
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,752
You don't understand
a fucking thing.

668
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,353
I was the one
driving the motorcycle that time ...

669
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,115
Yes, when Dad died.

670
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,592
He wasn't driving.

671
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,436
It was me. It was the first time
he let me drive than damn bike.

672
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,919
And she's hated me ever since.

673
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,997
Not once.
She didn't visit me once in prison.

674
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,277
Not one, single time.
Do you realize that?

675
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,757
Do you think
I did it on purpose? Huh?

676
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,792
Do you think it was my fault?

677
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,671
Frank, how could I know ...? If it
was an accident, it's not your fault.

678
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,229
Tell that to Mother!

679
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,233
Everything's
always my fault, isn't it?

680
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,153
But it's always
such a shame for little Timmy.

681
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:32,394
- You're so holier-than-thou.
- Was it just to buy Mother back?

682
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,792
This was my only chance ...
to have a family.

683
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,316
And you've just blown it,
you fucking idiot!

684
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,074
I <i>hate</i> you and Mother!

685
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,674
Jesus ...

686
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,430
Frank, I love you.

687
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,400
Frank ...

688
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,632
Frank?

689
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,190
Tim ...?

690
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,034
Frank ...?

691
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,191
Tim!

692
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,437
Stop, stop.

693
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,195
I'll do what I can
to help your mother.

694
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,828
Can you hear what I'm saying?
