The 405 north is backed up

00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,380
she would go right downstairs
and let him in again.

160
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,858
And there was no signs
of a break in.

161
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,488
No fingerprints that they found
on Dennis Law

162
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,031
in our house anywhere.

163
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,897
Well, he might
have been wearing gloves.

164
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,233
Look, honey, we don't know
what happened that night.

165
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,772
And we never will.

166
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,077
Like I don't know what you did
with that dog, either.

167
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,477
Nothing. I didn't do anything
to the dog.

168
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,847
He just ran away one day.
Dogs do that, you know.

169
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,419
Because he knew you didn't like him.

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,683
You know what, I liked him just fine.

171
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,418
I really don't want
to talk about it anymore.

172
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,558
What happened happened.

173
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,660
No amount of second guessing
is ever gonna change anything.

174
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,123
I raped her, you know.

175
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,626
It felt so good.

176
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,065
Can I show you how I did it?

177
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,567

[Scream]

179
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,340
She just touched me.

180
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,174
Who?

181
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,248
This, this girl.

182
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,340
I'd had a bad dream,
and I came downstairs,

183
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,113
and then l,
there's this girl standing here,

184
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,518
and then l, I heard the water,

185
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,419
and then I went
into the bathroom and,

186
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,186
and then I went to turn it off,
and she touched me.

187
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,419
Well, who was it?

188
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:28,194
I don't know. I didn't see her face.
I just felt her.

189
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,628
[Unintelligible]

190
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,498
I'm scared.

191
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,731
All right, okay, well, come here.

192
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,039
See what's going on.

193
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,218
Oh, Laura.

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,947
-What?
-Come here.

195
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,749
What?

196
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,084
Come on.

197
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,194
How did that get in here?

198
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,593
Well, I don't know,
we left the windows open,

199
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,664
probably just climbed in.

200
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:04,634
It was not the cat, Guy.
I felt her, I saw her.

Huh? Oh, uh, yeah.

206
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,688
That was the, uh, movers.
They're over at our old house.

207
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,890
I think maybe I'll, uh,
go over and supervise.

[Laughs]
I'll go.

209
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,861
Uh, I don't think there's a need
for both of us to go.

210
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,493
Why don't you stay here
and finish up?

211
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,094
I mean,
unless you really want to go.

Guy!

00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,852
Excuse me, I beg your pardon,
I was looking for my cat.

227
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,951
Cat?

228
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:43,501
Yeah, kind of a big white thing,
uh, I live a couple of houses down,

229
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,070
and, uh, she used to belong
to the previous owner.

230
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,570
Yes, we've seen her.

231
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,469
You have?

232
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,168
Well, not right now,
but, uh, the other night she got in,

233
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,937
and she nearly scared me to death.

234
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,273
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

235
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,405
I try not to let her out,
but, you know,

236
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,712
she still thinks Mrs. Gitchell owns
the house, and, uh, you know.

237
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,844
Uh, l, you know,
she, she had a lot of cats,

238
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,551
and she gave me a couple
just before she, her son put her in...

239
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,820
uh, are you okay?

240
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:10,860
No.

[Breathing heavily]

242
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:17,568
I was... yes, l, just a minute ago
l, I was in there and--

243
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,137
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
Mrs. Gitchell gave you--

244
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,104
Yeah, a couple of her cats.

245
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,974
I mean, she had about 20 of them,
uh, she was a batty old thing.

246
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,808
Why?

247
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,405
Well, l, you know, I only moved
in here a couple of years ago,

248
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,385
but, uh, you know,
she never came out of the house.

249
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,455
She used to stay in there,
and, you know,

250
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,821
even in the middle of the night
you'd see all the lights blazing.

251
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:45,329
And, and I'd hear her in there
screamin', talkin' to herself.

252
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,662
And I'd come over, you know,
just to make sure she was okay.

253
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,100
Even then, she never let me inside.

254
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,696
Then, of course, the, the kids
all started talkin' about that.

255
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,706
They would?

256
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,674
Well, you know how kids are.

257
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,304
You know, they got an old house,
an old lady livin' in it,

258
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,349
so they, they say she's a witch,
you know, things like that.

00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,748
[Laughs]
You know kids.

260
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,547
I imagine your daughter's
the same way.

261
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,554
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,715
Oh, uh, isn't that your daughter,

263
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,623
uh, the girl I saw in the window
lookin' down?

264
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,955
Where?

265
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,724
Well, uh, right up, right up there.

266
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:24,599
I saw her lookin' in the window
down here just before you ran out.

267
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,660
Sweetheart, are you okay?

268
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,295
But...

269
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:12,213
Uh, it was almost
seven months ago,

270
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,879
and we had just gotten back from
a recital that my daughter had given,

271
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,354
and I heard the dog barking,

272
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,221
and, you know, my daughter,
she loved that dog so much,

273
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,319
so we think that maybe
she went down and let him in.

274
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,160
And then she vanished.

275
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,692
And it was ten days
before we knew where she was.

276
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,498
NEIL: But you did find her.

277
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,038
Well, we didn't.

278
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,438
We had a lot of strangers
helping us look for her,

279
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,103
and two of them found her.

280
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,171
They were two kids
that lived not that far away,

281
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,979
and one of them was the one
that killed her.

[Cries]

290
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,437
He had molested
other kids in the past,

291
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,564
and he was a minor at the time,

292
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,008
so the police
never really did anything.

293
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,109
[Sighs]

294
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,413
And he only lived four blocks away,
but I'd never seen him.

295
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,354
But he'd seen us, that's for sure.

296
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,188
And the police think that he
was probably stalking Kimberly

297
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,693
for quite some time.

298
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,957
Was he convicted?

299
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,930
No.

300
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,432
They arrested him.

301
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:40,266
And they found a lot of circumstantial
evidence linking him to Kimberly,

302
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,535
but the case never came to trial.

303
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,476
Right after the arraignment,
he hung himself,

304
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,774
which is something
I still don't understand

305
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,008
because how could the police
not have known

306
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,550
that he was a risk for suicide,

307
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,212
but they left him alone,
and he killed himself,

308
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,257
and we never got our day in court.

309
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,522
And that was really important,
you know?

310
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,223
I just wanted to hear him say
that he had done it,

311
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,491
just so I could...

312
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,665
Know for sure he had.

313
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,060
Yeah.

314
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,802
Well, I'm very sorry
you had to go through that.

315
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,277
I realize it's not the same, but, uh,

316
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,942
my wife, uh, she died
about five years ago,

317
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,451
that, that's why I moved here.

318
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,989
Uh, I couldn't stay
in the other place, uh,

319
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,650
too many memories.

320
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,691
Yeah, us, too.

321
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,261
Would you mind looking
at a picture of my daughter?

322
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,768
I, I know you only saw that girl for--

323
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:51,571
But I don't really see
how it could be your daughter.

324
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,679
To a fresh start.

325
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,615
GUY: Here, here.

326
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,983
Now, uh, if you have any complaints
about the food,

327
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,181
don't blame Laura,
this is my own little creation.

328
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,587
I call it Chicken Guy.

329
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,023
I made a plate of vegetables
for you, Claire.

330
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,754
I remember another creation
with, uh, with lamb.

331
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,056
GUY: You didn't like the lamb?

332
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,096
Not especially.

333
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,790
-GUY: What?
-LAURA: Oh, good Lord.

334
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,265
Well, you can't be great
at everything.

335
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,336
-I mean, this house is fantastic.
-LAURA: Thank you.

336
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,600
You and Laura continue to outdo
me and Claire in every way.

337
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,106
-LAURA: Oh, not really.
-GUY: Oh, no, that's not true.

338
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,300
You don't think, sweetheart?

339
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,969
And, uh, a little broccoli
and carrots and everything.

340
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,570
-JASON: Are you still...?
-LAURA: Oh, thank you, thank you.

341
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,376
I think this house is haunted.

342
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,318
I'm sorry, Laura, but I do.

343
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,514
There's something...

344
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,353
There's a very peculiar energy here.

345
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,452
I felt it the second I walked in.

346
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,655
I told you.

347
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,856
GUY: Well, you coached her.

348
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,399
LAURA: No, I didn't.
I didn't say a word.

349
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,765
You're right.
There is a strange energy here.

350
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,895
The very first night we were here,

351
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,236
I felt something or someone standing
next to me in the bathroom.

352
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,004
I felt it there, too.
I feel it everywhere.

353
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,704
Well, I don't feel anything.
How about you, Guy?

354
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,747
No, I don't,
which I find very interesting.

355
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,407
LAURA: Really?
You find that so interesting.

356
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,711
What's that supposed to mean?

357
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,844
It just means, why are you always
the one who feels it?

358
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,582
Why doesn't it ever happen to me?

359
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,317
LAURA: It just happened to Claire.

360
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,858
JASON: I wouldn't take that
very seriously.

361
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,155
-Claire's always feeling things.
-GUY: Hm.

362
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,230
LAURA: Jason.

363
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,525
Thank you so much, Jason.

364
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,031
JASON: It's true.

365
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,796
I just wish she'd feel more
buying some lottery tickets.

366
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,768
[Laughing]

367
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,806
GUY: I'm sorry.
Claire, it was funny. Come on.

368
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,307
LAURA: Look, she's not the only one
who has seen stuff.

369
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,434
Neil.

370
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,374
The other day,

371
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,504
he saw a girl standing up in the
window upstairs in that bedroom.

372
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,206
GUY: Neil.

373
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,873
-LAURA: Neil, that's our new neighbor.
-GUY: Oh.

374
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,317
And it was the same day
that that happened in the bathroom.

375
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,217
GUY: Oh, well, now, come on, now.

376
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,845
You're not gonna say
that that was writing, honey.

377
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,923
That was, that was just,

378
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,787
it was a couple of strokes
left by a paintbrush.

379
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,020
You left them there yourself
without realizing it.

380
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,288
You don't believe that.

381
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,590
GUY: I do.

382
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,794
I did not make this up, Guy.

383
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,599
Wait a minute. What a--?
What are you guys talking about?

384
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,003
Come on, I'll show you. Come on.

385
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,735
JASON: Now?
You're gonna go now?

386
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,640
-LAURA: It's right here.
-GUY: We're eating.

387
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,575
CLAIRE: One second.

388
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,043
GUY: You know, Jason--

389
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,204
LAURA: Come here.
CLAIRE: I want to see this.

390
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,009
-GUY: Don't wait. This is ridiculous.
-CLAIRE: What are you talking about?

391
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,016
LAURA: It's weird, Claire.

392
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,812
CLAIRE: Yeah.

393
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,650
See right there?
You can just make it out.

394
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,087
Do you see it?

395
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,089
CLAIRE: Yeah.

396
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,389
I turned my back for just a second,
and there it was.

397
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,521
And something else was painted
upstairs on the upstairs window,

398
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,431
and I'm telling you right now,
I did not put it there, I'm not crazy.

399
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,127
Nobody said you were.

400
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,296
LAURA:
So, how do you think it went?

401
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,304
Pretty good.

402
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,398
LAURA: Oh, I think it was
much better than pretty good.

403
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,339
I think it went great.

404
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,570
KIMBERLY: You think so?
Maybe I should be a singer.

405
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,170
GUY: Great. I thought you said
you were gonna be a doctor.

406
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,509
KIMBERLY: Maybe I can do both.

407
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,880
I'll go around and be a doctor,
and when people are sick,

408
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,646
I'll sing and make them feel
all better.

409
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,186
GUY:
You think it's that simple, huh?

410
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,812
KIMBERLY: Naturally.

411
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,619
[Laughing]
[Phone rings]

412
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:01,960
Hello?

413
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,796
MALE: Hello, uh, uh, listen.

414
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,564
It's, it's after midnight, okay?

415
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,904
Uh, I have to work tomorrow,
so let's, let's just stop this, okay?

416
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,272
Let's just cut this out.

417
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,845
LAURA: Who is it?

418
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,113
It's a wrong number,
that's what it was.

419
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,913
Jesus Christ, look at me.

420
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,385
The phone rings,
I'm jumpin' out of my skin.

421
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,547
I hope you're happy.

422
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,024
You and all your spook talk,
and you're sister, too.

423
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,685
You're drunk.

424
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,693
Yeah?

425
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,387
LAURA: Yeah.

426
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,658
Well, you've been drunk a lot, too,
you know.

427
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,428
Hey, you know how many times
I come home last two months

428
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,730
I find you passed out?

429
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,770
How many times you ever come
home and find me passed out?

430
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,568
None. That's how many.

431
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,041
LAURA: I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

432
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:50,080
GUY: Talk?
When do you ever want to talk?

433
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,082
You've been shutting me out
ever since it happened.

434
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,887
The other night, that was
the first time we've made love

435
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,115
since I can't remember when.

436
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:05,061
You honestly believe that you're
the only one who's suffering?

437
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,723
I know.

438
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,826
I make one mistake,
I put the goddamn dog out,

439
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,840
and I gotta pay for it
for the rest of my life!

440
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,136
You were the one that heard him,

441
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,642
why didn't you go down
and let him in?

442
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,336
Because I didn't want
to make you mad.

443
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,880
You just flipped out
about your lousy shoes,

444
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,381
and I didn't want to hear it again.

445
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,146
Hey! I told you
when we got that dog

446
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,051
that I wanted him to stay outside,

447
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,987
but you let Kimberly
spoil him so bad,

448
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,719
he started barking the second
anybody put him in the yard.

449
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,556
He was barking in the yard

450
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,529
because Dennis Law
was hanging around the house.

451
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,896
Now, that's, that's why
you got rid of him.

452
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,664
You blame him when all he
was trying to do was to warn us.

453
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,500
It was an accident, Laura.

454
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,438
You want to know
what happened to the dog?

455
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,978
I backed over him, okay?
He's dead!

456
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,082
I'm sorry, he'd, uh...

457
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,019
Oh, Jesus, man.

458
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:10,493
He'd gotten out, and, uh,
I was late for work and l, I just...

459
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,030
I missed him, that's all.

460
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,396
He was just sitting
in the driveway and...

461
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,732
...you know he never had
any sense about cars.

462
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,497
No.

463
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,640
So why didn't you tell me?

464
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,642
Why'd you lie to me if you--?

465
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,509
Because I know that you'd say
I did it on purpose,

466
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,845
but I swear to God I didn't.

467
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,680
I would have replaced him if I could,
and we still can.

468
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,189
We can go tomorrow
and get a new dog if you want.

469
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,316
Oh, sure, Guy,
let's, let's replace the dog,

470
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:46,124
and while we're at it
we'll just replace Kimberly, too.

471
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,789
We can go make some love,
that'll make you happy.

472
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:48,524
GUY: Laura.

473
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,429
-LAURA: Shut up!
-GUY: Laura!

474
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,534
GUY: So, what happened here?

475
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:56,300
Fight. Cut out...
and broke my finger pretty good.

476
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,139
GUY: It's not broken, it's dislocated.
Want to see the X-ray?

477
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,941
You don't remember me, do you?

478
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,483
It's me, Ben.

479
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,553
I found your little girl.

480
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,413
Oh, yeah, right.

481
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,624
Take this down to the lab for me.

482
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,691
I'm sorry, l, uh, I only saw you
that one time at the arraignment.

483
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,893
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

484
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,697
I wanted to walk over
and say something,

485
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,830
but I felt kinda weird, you know,
me being friends with Dennis and all.

486
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,066
Yeah, well, uh,

487
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,337
I guess we don't always know
the people we're close to.

488
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,675
I know.
I knew Dennis my whole life.

489
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,646
He didn't do it.

490
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,547
I mean, when we found her,
he was so upset,

491
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,812
you know, crying and shit.

492
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,788
I just, I don't think he would act
like that if he had done it at all.

493
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
Guilt will make you do funny things.

494
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,422
Yeah, but I really don't think
he did it.

495
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,551
I mean, I know the police says

496
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,323
he fooled around with little girls
and stuff,

497
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,490
but he was just a kid himself
when he did that, you know?

498
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,897
He was a really normal guy.

499
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,366
Look, he did it, okay?

500
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,438
There was all kinds of evidence
linking him to Kimberly.

501
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,369
Yeah, but I think the police
planted that stuff.

502
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,271
I mean, kinda like O.J., you know?

503
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,433
Everybody was freaking out,

504
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,033
so they wanted to grab somebody
right away,

505
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,205
and, you know,
Dennis looked kind of weird so...

506
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,806
Dennis was weird. Let's just
have a look at your finger.

507
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,441
I don't think he killed himself,
either.

508
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,281
I think the police went in there
and hung him themselves.

509
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,548
You know, Ben, let's just change
the subject. All right?

510
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,283
Now, we're gonna have to pop
this back into joint,

511
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,255
and it might hurt a little.

512
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,987
You know, the way I figure it,
they knew he was gonna get away

513
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,790
because they didn't have anything
on him, you know,

514
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,524
but they could never let that happen,
so they strung him, I mean--

Well, not exactly, l, I just told--

00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,145
GUY: I know what you told her.

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,877
You got a big mouth, you know that?

524
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,715
And if Laura was still here, I'd tell
her not to speak to you anymore.

525
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,152
Oh, she, she's not here?

We're separated.

that's what the letters were?

I didn't exactly stick around --

545

Oh, uh, hi, uh, Miss Goldstein,
it's Guy Dykstra,

546
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,112
you sold us the house on Kilkeya
a few weeks back.

547
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,384
No, yeah,
we're very happy there, um,

548
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,689
but I was wondering, uh, do you know
how to contact the former owner?

549
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,162
I found some things there
I'd like to return to her.

550
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,392
You related to Miss Gitchell?

551
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,661
You related or just friends?

552
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,668
Uh, we're friends,
but we haven't seen her for a while.

553
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,261
Well, you'd best prepare yourself.
She's one crazy old witch.

00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,431
What do you mean?

Where the hell ya been, Ralph?
I've been cooking all day.

561
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,954
It's isn't Ralph, Mrs. Gitchell, uh,
it's Guy Dykstra.

562
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,589
I live in the house you used to own.

563
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:17,567
Well. Come over here so I can get
a better look at you, huh?

Uh, Laura lives at the house with me.

00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,518
Do you like spaghetti?

My baby, he don't like spaghetti.

569
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,129
But I make him eat it anyway.

'Cause it's real good for you.

571
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,102
Well, yeah, it is. Spaghetti is
a vital part of a balanced diet.

572
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,972
Yeah, um...

573
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:57,173
But, uh, look, I was wondering, um,

574
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,250
we've been having some strange
things go on at the house.

575
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,514
For instance, the computer
and printer and TV

576
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,145
will go on for no reason,

577
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:10,717
and, and, and there's, uh,
we found writing on the wall.

00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,191
Writing.

579
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,822
That's right.

580
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:26,807
Well, those Mexicans... they spray
crap every now and again.

581
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,645
I don't like those Mexicans.

582
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,910
There's more and more of them
all the time.

583
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,248
Yeah, well, I don't think this has
anything to do with Mexicans.

584
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,346
You never,
back when it was your house,

585
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,188
you never noticed
anything strange going on?

586
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,557
They killed those Kennedy boys,
both of them.

That's when you ruin everything,
when you chase the girls around.

590
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:06,182
My baby, he knows that for sure.

591
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,583

592
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,512
MRS. GITCHELL: I got two.

Only one's alive.

I promised myself no one
would ever take him away.

595
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,792
They'd have to go through me first.

GUY: Hm.

597
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,900
And, and the other one,
what about him?

598
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,239
Or, or was it a him?

599
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,604
What the hell you talking about?

600
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,615
Your baby, Mrs. Gitchell.

601
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,587
He was just two weeks old.

602
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,691
Just two weeks.

603
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,988
And he ups and dies.

604
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,963
It was the year that, that...

605
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,595
Yes?

have you been all day?

610
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,010
Yeah, she got me the same way
one or two times, man.

Stephanie Watkins, don't you?

right before I met Jason?

614

Well, she used to be friends
with a psychic--

not to tell me anything about you,

619
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,485
and you haven't, have you, Claire?

620
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,285
I haven't. No.

621
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,654
Now there's a wonder.

622
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,161
JAY: There's no place here
for that kind of attitude.

623
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,323
Now, if you won't take this seriously,
you can just leave now.

624
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,229
Or I will.

disruptions to the proceedings,

626
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,903
will there, Jason?

627
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:08,869
CLAIRE AND JASON: No.

628
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,873
JASON: There, there won't be.

629
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:16,041
JAY: Now, this is not a séance,
it's a reading.

630
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,211
I'm not going to be writing
anything down.

631
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,479
I just use this
to help me concentrate.

632
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,419
Understood?
Just answer yes or no.

633
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,014
-GUY: Yes.
-LAURA: Yes.

634
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,184
JAY: Now, I'm gonna ask you
a few questions

635
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,990
and whenever I ask one,

636
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,294
I want you to answer yes or no.

637
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,630
Yes.

638
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,466
JAY: I'm not trying to lead you
in any way.

639
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,097
This just helps me to stay focused.

640
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:44,867
Understood?

641
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes.

642
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,936
JAY: There's a girl.

643
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:56,714
She's a very young girl,
I can't quite tell her age.

644
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,282
But her name begins with a C.

645
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,020
No. Make that a K.

646
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,820
Does this mean anything to you?

647
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,831
Yes.

648
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,429
JAY: This girl,
she says she's your daughter.

649
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,676
She says she loved you both
very much,

650
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,677
but she was taken away from you
very suddenly.

651
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,212
CLAIRE: [Gasps]

652
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,044
JAY: Does this mean
anything to you?

653
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,708
She was murdered.

654
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,115
JAY: Just yes or no, please.

655
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,687
Yes.

656
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,888
She says something about singing.

657
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,662
She says she sings for you both
all the time.

658
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,636
Because she knows you feel bad
about the way she left,

659
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,969
and she wants you to feel better.

660
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,675
Does this make any sense to you?

661
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,770
LAURA: Yes.

662
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:05,747
She says she knows
this has been very hard on you both.

663
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,453
She knows you blame each other
for what happened.

664
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,722
And it makes her very sad.

665
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:22,303
She hears you fighting all the time,
and she wants you to stop

666
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:28,606
and realize that she's always
with you...

667
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,112
...everywhere you go.

668
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,210
Is this understood?

669
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,709
Yes.

670
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,087
Now, this house where you're living...

671
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,427
She says it's no accident
that you're here.

672
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:53,963
She led you here
for a very special reason.

673
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,505
Is this understood?

674
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,006
LAURA: Yes.

675
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,578
JAY: There is a man.

676
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,355
His name is...

677
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,652
I can't see it.

678
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,557
This man is the reason
she's no longer with you.

679
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,499
She's been trying to tell you
about this man for the longest time.

680
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:33,002
And this is not the man
the police were blaming.

681
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,479
The true man...

682
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,148
Can't make it out.

683
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,223
His name is...

684
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,155
...priest.

685
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,121
Is he a priest?

686
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,862
But this is the man
who took her from you.

687
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:02,371
He's taken others before,
and he will take others again,

688
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,306
unless you stop him.

689
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,508
Is this understood?

690
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,041
Yes.

691
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,811
JAY: She says you have to do
whatever is necessary to stop him,

692
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:19,287
even if you have to take the life
of this man yourselves.

693
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,182
You must do it.

694
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,295
There are children all around him,

695
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:33,098
and he's planning to do to others
what he did to her.

696
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,536
-What is his name?
-JAY: Can you please be quiet?

697
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,112
Now... She's gone.

698
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,679
GUY: No.

699
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,649
You're just like Stephanie said
you were.

700
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,914
Didn't you hear me tell you before
we started not to say one word?

701
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,181
JASON: She said she was sorry.

702
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,087
Well, it's too late for that,
isn't it?

703
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,820
This young girl had a very
important message for her parents,

704
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,793
and you went and...

705
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,262
[Groans]

706
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,299
GUY: What is it?

707
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:14,669
Oh, my God!

708
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,732
GUY: Sergeant MacDonald?

709
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,928
Oh, look at this.
Oh, boy, it's good to see you.

710
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,299
Uh, are we interrupting?

711
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,235
No, no, have a seat.

712
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:42,862
Oh, good.

713
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,066
I'm just writin' up
a freakin' arrest report.

714
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:45,869
Yeah.

715
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,734
What'd you do to your face?

716
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,779
GUY: Oh, l, uh, cut myself shaving.

717
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,778
Well, that's some nick.

718
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:51,313
GUY: Yeah.

719
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,080
How are you two holdin' up?

720
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,515
-Oh, we're good.
-Well...

721
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,678
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about you.

722
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,915
-Well, that's nice to hear.
-No, I'm serious.

723
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,517
I got in a prayer request at church,
whole congregation's praying for you.

724
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,253
LAURA: Thank you.

725
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,353
My wife asked after you.

726
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,658
Kimberly touched a lot of people.

727
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,460
Yes, she did.

728
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,056
She really did, yeah.

729
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,828
So, you still in the same place?

730
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,529
No, we moved.

731
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,334
MACDONALD:
That's good, that's good.

732
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,965
Must have been tough
living in that house.

733
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,509
It was very tough.

734
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:22,905
A house or...?

735
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,607
Uh, yes, it's a house, it's, it's real
nice, we like it just fine now.

736
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,015
Uh, but...
the last few weeks we've, uh,

737
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,849
we've really started to have
some serious doubts about the case.

738
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,285
Doubts?

739
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,019
Uh, yeah, we're just not convinced
Dennis Law was guilty anymore.

740
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:37,684
MACDONALD: Well--

741
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,626
I know it sounds strange, but he--

742
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,461
We just want to speak
to you about it.

743
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,661
Let me ease your minds
about that right now.

744
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,900
There's not a question in my mind
that he was guilty, not a one.

745
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,942
I'm not talking
about just the hard evidence,

746
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,671
the hair, the fiber, the rest.

747
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,114
I'm talking about a gut feeling.

748
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,012
When you do this work
as long as I have,

749
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,948
you get a sense of these things.

750
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,687
Well, that's what you told us
at the time.

751
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,482
MACDONALD: What?

752
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,047
Well, for instance, the hair
you found on Kimberly's body,

753
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,286
it matched Dennis Law,
that's what you told us, right?

754
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,420
But if he's the one
that found the body,

755
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,897
isn't it just possible that that's
the reason the hair was found on--?

756
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,026
No. Kimberly...

757
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:25,369
She was raped repeatedly,
you know.

758
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:31,539
The hair that we found on her body
was in coagulated blood.

759
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,378
You don't bleed after you die.

760
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,714
That hair was embedded in there.

761
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,515
And, of course,
he knew exactly where to find her.

762
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,317
But he was looking everywhere,
wasn't he?

763
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,016
I mean, that wasn't
the only place he looked,

764
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,491
and why would he go right to her
if he didn't want to get caught?

765
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,496
Dr. Dykstra, can you tell me
where this is going?

766
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,122
'Cause it's been
months and months,

767
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,997
and up until now I was under
that impression you had no doubts.

768
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,570
We just have good reason to think
the case should be re-opened.

769
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,006
And the reason is?

770
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,940
We just do.

771
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,600
We think someone else
is responsible,

772
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,679
and it's very likely
he's going to strike again.

773
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,077
MACDONALD:
And that person is?

774
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,509
We don't know.

775
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,681
You two aren't making this
easy on me.

776
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,020
This case is closed.

777
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,822
I need a name, compelling evidence

778
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:23,832
that I can take to my superior
officers in order to re-open it.

779
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,629
And it has to be
compelling evidence.

780
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,532
LAURA: Okay.

781
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,763
Kimberly told us.

782
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,840
We had a psychic come in
and give us a reading,

783
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:33,967
and Kimberly, she told us
that the killer is still out there,

784
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,875
and he's going to strike again
unless he's stopped.

785
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,080
I see.

786
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,323
A priest.

787
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,155
Jay said that she'd been killed
by a priest.

788
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,755
But I don't ever remember Kimberly
coming into contact with one.

789
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,198
Well, we didn't know she'd come
into contact with Dennis Law

790
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,633
until the police picked him up.

791
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:03,228
If she ever had come
into contact with him.

792
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,508
God, that poor kid.

793
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,873
Killed himself over something
he never even did.

794
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,606
Ah, he did something, all right.

795
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,739
He may not have killed Kimberly,

796
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,750
but he molested
a couple of other kids.

797
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,550
I'm not so sure anymore.

798
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,647
I mean, all we've got to go on
is what the police have told us,

and if they were wrong
about Kimberly,

800
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,354
God knows what else
they're wrong about.

801
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,124
Yeah, that's what the kid
in the ER said.

No, that's okay.

No, I want to be here.

Mrs. Gitchell was not a witch,
she was just a little crazy.

Every time we'd go
anywhere near there,

she'd crack the door open

Well, every time we'd play with it,

he would just sit on the front stoop
staring at us.

I mean, we were only 10 or 11
at the time,

Now, Julie, that's not fair.

866
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,796
You took piano lessons from Kenneth
for three whole months,

867
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,330
and he never once tried anything.

868
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,763
He sure looked at me funny.

869
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,530
He was just shy, and who can
blame him having a mother like that.

00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,334
But, you know, when I first met her,
she was perfectly normal.

871
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,602
But then, of course, Mr. Monk died,

872
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,803
and she married that Ralph Gitchell,

873
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,777
and, oh, what a nightmare he was.

874
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,348
He and his daughter both.

875
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,077
You could hear them yelling
all the way down at my place.

876
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,745
You know, I believe
that's what drove her crazy,

877
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,755
and that's
what made Kenneth shy, too.

878
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,222
Poor boy.

879
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,386
You know, I don't think I ever once
saw him with a girlfriend.

880
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,997

01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,850
No. Not really.

941
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,446
We've been very pre-occupied,
you know?

942
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,753
Turns out, there's a lot
of unanswered questions

943
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,088
about Kimberly's death.

944
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,789
Oh? Oh, yeah, I thought they caught
the person that did it.

945
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:35,659
Yeah, so did we.

946
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,824
We thought so, too,
but we have reason to believe

947
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,993
that the person who did it
may still be out there.

948
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,027
You don't happen to know anything,
do you?

949
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:43,901
Me?

950
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,872
Well, I mean, you were
the director of the recital,

951
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,943
maybe you saw someone
or noticed something...

952
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,773
-...or maybe she confided in you.
-No, no, no, no, no.

953
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,506
No, l, I taught her music
once a week, you know.

954
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:52,581
That's it.

955
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,115
Really.

956
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,343
I barely knew her.

957
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,986
Thought I'd ask.

958
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:04,919
Did you see him?

959
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,518
Yeah.

960
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,663
He's guilty as sin.

961
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,131
NURSE: Oh, Mr. Monk.

962
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,172
There you are.
Did you receive my message?

963
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,205
MONK: Message?

964
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,241
Well, your mother had
a slight heart attack.

965
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:20,900
Oh?

966
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,411
But don't worry.
She pulled through as always.

967
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,780
Good.

968
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,252
MRS. GITCHELL: Who is it?

969
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,753
Is that you, Ralph?

970
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,083
Hm?

971
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,593
It's not Ralph, Mom.
It's me, Kenneth.

972
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,163
MRS. GITCHELL: It's my baby.
Ohh.

973
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,429
Oh, I don't feel so good.

974
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,128
MONK: I know.

975
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,364
MRS. GITCHELL: Ohh.

976
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,236
MONK: I know.

977
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,536
[Groans]

978
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,578
Oh, I wish I was dead.

979
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,147
I feel so bad.

980
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,580
Those nurses, they're so mean.

981
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:08,714
Oh... that's because they're Mexican.

982
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:13,186
Oh, that's all there is anymore.

983
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:13,921
Mom.

984
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,691
MRS. GITCHELL: Hmm?

985
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,131
Uh, Mrs. Dykstra,
she came by the school today.

986
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,261
You know,
the woman who bought the house.

987
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,967
MRS. GITCHELL: Mrs. Dykstra.

988
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,237
Yeah. You remember,
she came by a few days ago. Okay?

989
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,539
You remember you had
some strange visitors.

990
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,275
[Laughing]
I get them all the time.

991
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,146
Okay. But this was...

992
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,185
This was a woman and her husband,

993
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,655
and I think, I think it was
another woman, too. Okay?

994
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,987
-MRS. GITCHELL: Mm.
-MONK: You remember?

995
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,186
You know, Ralph came by,

996
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:50,026
and he brought
some of his whores with him.

997
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,657
The nerve of that man. Oh.

998
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,360
MONK: Ralph's dead, Mom. Okay?

999
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,165
These were the people
who bought your house.

1000
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,464
Mom, Mom.

1001
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,202
Mom, what did you say to them?

1002
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,574
Did they ask about me?

1003
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,447
Uh-uh. Wait, she does,
she always asks about you.

1004
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,581
She's dead, Mom. Okay?

1005
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,987
I hope you didn't say anything
to the Dykstras about them.

1006
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,855
You didn't, did you?

1007
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,593
She comes in the night,
and she sits at the foot of my bed,

1008
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,533
and she tries to hurt me.

1009
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,901
And then she wants me
to hurt you, too,

1010
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:34,636
but no way am I gonna hurt my baby.

1011
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,611
No way am I gonna hurt my baby.

1012
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:40,341
MONK: I know you must have said
something to the Dykstras, Mom.

1013
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:44,476
Mrs. Dykstra, she was asking
the strangest questions.

1014
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:48,448
I tell you not to chase
the girls around?

1015
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:53,860
No, Lord, oh, no, there's she is,
she's right behind you.

1016
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,056
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1017
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:57,858
Mom.

1018
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,367
-MRS. GITCHELL: What?
-MONK: There's nobody there.

1019
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,561
Oh, yes, yes.

1020
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:08,167
Oh, she comes back and back,
and she hurts my kitties,

1021
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:12,407
and she hits me, and, oh,

1022
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:18,044
I swear to God she's just about
driven me out of my mind.

1023
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,587
She has, Mom.

1024
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,351
Make her go away.
I don't want to see her no more.

1025
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,086
Please make her go away.

1026
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,752
I don't want to see Ralph either.

1027
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,659
Okay, Mom.

1028
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,230
-MRS. GITCHELL: Okay?
-I'll make them go away.

1029
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,790
MRS. GITCHELL:
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1030
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,164
I love you, Mom.

1031
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:38,866
MRS. GITCHELL:
Oh, I love you, too, baby.

1032
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,205
I love you.

1033
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,313
MRS. GITCHELL:
[Cries]

1034
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,974
No, no!

1035
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,983
My mom! My mom, I think
she had another heart attack!

1036
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,577
-NURSE: Okay.
-Go, go!

1037
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,662
Molly? Hi. You want a ride?

1038
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,422
No, thanks.

1039
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,624
Ah, come on.
It's not like we're strangers.

1040
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:38,995
Besides, we got a present for you.

1041
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,398
Oh, yeah?

1042
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,244
So, how's school?
How's Mr. Monk?

1043
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,006
He's been absent lately.

1044
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,241
His mom died,
so he's been going to the funeral,

1045
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,511
and, you know, stuff like that.

1046
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,052
LAURA: Well, that's not good.

1047
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,317
Yeah.
We've got a really mean substitute.

1048
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,016
She's really dumb, too.

1049
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,387
Like the other day,

1050
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,518
she was showing us
this math problem,

1051
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,823
and she got it wrong.

1052
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:13,424
So, what'd you get for me?
I hope it's nothing Kimberly owned.

1053
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,868
I mean, she had real nice stuff
and everything,

1054
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,203
but, you know, it'd feel real funny
owning something

1055
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,833
that used to belong
to a murdered person.

1056
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,213
LAURA: So, in your opinion,
Mr. Monk likes girls better than boys?

1057
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,808
Well, he yells at them more.

1058
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,785
But they really deserve it.

1059
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:36,187
And he'll talk to us at recess
about really cool stuff.

1060
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,953
He's not like most teachers.

1061
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,051
He's sorta like a kid himself.

1062
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,654
LAURA: And what does he talk
to you about?

1063
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:45,958
MOLLY: What's this?

1064
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,730
It's a DVD of you singing
at the pageant last Christmas.

1065
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,533
And that's my present?

1066
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,698
Yeah.
We figured you didn't have one.

1067
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,298
Thanks.

1068
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,675
So, Molly, what I was trying
to get at before is does Mr. Monk

1069
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,511
ever talk about anything that's
inappropriate for a girl your age?

1070
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,515
What do you mean?

1071
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:07,214
Well, she means adult type stuff,
uh, things that might be personal.

1072
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:10,850
Well, he talks about Michigan.
He used to live there.

1073
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,793
And he saw a bear one time
when he was walking in the woods,

1074
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,796
and he pretended like he was dead.

1075
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:19,197
Does he ever keep you after school
or give you rides home or, or--?

1076
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,030
Well, he's a real friendly guy.

1077
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,469
Well, except with the boys.

1078
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:24,197
I don't know.

1079
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,366
Jenna says he's a fag,
but he's a really nice fag.

1080
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,568
Uh-huh.

1081
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,167
So, has he ever tried to touch you

1082
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,076
or ask you to sit on his lap
or anything?

1083
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,376
Why do you guys keep asking me
about Mr. Monk?

1084
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,075
He's a real friendly guy.

1085
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,709
Even my mom thinks he's nice,

1086
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,845
and she's never liked
any of my teachers.

1087
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,981
We just want to know some things
about your life, that's all.

1088
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:46,721
We used to see you a lot, and now
we don't see you so much anymore.

1089
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,627
Yeah. You must feel kind of sad
without Kimberly.

1090
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,255
We do.

1091
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,266
Well, you too, right?

1092
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:57,169
Well, you know, I thought I would,
and sometimes I think about her,

1093
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:00,572
but my mom told me I shouldn't
'cause it's morbid.

1094
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,974
And you know,
she wasn't always that nice to me.

1095
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,570
She used to brag about
all the nice things she had,

01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,774
and how her dad was a doctor
and everything.

She thought she was all that.

I mean, the whole story was so crazy
her mother didn't really believe her,

1108
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,311
but she kept asking why
we took Molly back to the house,

1109
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,581
and Molly kept saying we were asking
questions about Mr. Monk,

1110
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,384
and, boy, we had a hell of a time
explaining that.

it doesn't even sound like Kimberly

01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:02,529
to attack another child.

that is really strange, right?

1119
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:08,034
She's mad about it, that's all.

and she's angry about it,
and who can blame her?

1123
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,007
I mean, the police won't even
re-open the case

unless they get some hard evidence,
quote, unquote.

But don't worry, we'll get some.

that he'd do it again,

1130
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,526
and you know he had
to have left a trail.

1131
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,789
But what if he hasn't?

1132
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,128
Well, then, we'll kill him.

1133
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,168
Have you lost your mind
completely?

1134
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,169
You can't run around
saying things like that.

1135
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,205
What, do you want to go to jail?

1136
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:45,637
If that's what it takes.

1137
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,936
We don't even know
if this is the guy yet.

1138
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,533
No, we know.

1139
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,510
We may not have any proof yet

1140
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,515
but deep down,
both of us know he's the one.

1141
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,017
And like Claire said,
we may never get any proof.

1142
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:58,416
And what are we supposed to do,

1143
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,114
just stand back and let him hurt
other innocent children?

1144
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:02,155
Of course not.

1145
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,419
So how are we supposed
to stop him unless we kill him?

-It's not gonna come to that.
-How do you know?

Well, it might,

1148
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,831
but you can't run around shooting
your mouth off before hand.

he's so smart?

Mrs. Dykstra, someone has been
calling me at all hours of the night,

01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,712
and obviously,
if I call back this number

1164

I think for some reason
you have it in your head

1169
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,724
that I had something to do
with Kimberly's death,

1170
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,160
and now you're playing
some kind of game with me,

And I did check on missing kids
dating back to 15 years ago,

1204
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,574
and his name never comes up
as a suspect on a single one of 'em.

1205
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:20,909
Great.

1206

And I'm not finished yet.

1207
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:27,055
I said he wasn't a suspect,
but he was questioned

1208
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,556
along with his mother
when his stepsister disappeared

1209
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,149
almost 10 years ago.

Stepsister?

1211
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:37,858
Yeah. Apparently, uh,
his old man bought the farm

1212
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,900
when Monk was just a kid,

1213
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,266
and then his mother married
this guy named Ralph Gitchell.

1214
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,738
Now, um, he's got a record.

1215
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:49,368
He's arrested twice
for slappin' the old lady around,

1216
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:53,175
and it looks like
he slapped Monk around, too.

1217
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,080
Anyway, he had this daughter
named, um...

1218
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,084
...Elena,

1219
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,484
who was livin' with them
and kept on stayin' there

1220
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,057
even after Gitchell died.

1221
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,821
It appears that, um,
Elena had some troubles of her own

1222
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:10,660
because Mrs. Gitchell had her
sent away to a reformatory.

1223
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,257
Um, I don't know why,
all the records are sealed,

1224
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:17,805
but, um, she ran away from
the home, oh, about 10 years ago

1225
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,271
and has been missing ever since.

1226
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,966
And Monk was questioned about it.

1227
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,941
Yeah. The old lady, too.

1228
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,070
They didn't have anything
on either one of 'em,

1229
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,306
so that's as far as it went.

1230
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,712
But get this.

1231
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:32,412
At the time, Monk was teaching at,
uh, Hepplewhite Elementary, right?

1232
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,921
Well, almost as soon
as Elena vanishes,

1233
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,389
he quits his job
in the middle of the school year

1234
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,756
and moves off to Michigan.

1235
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,887
And that's where he stayed
until just about a year ago.

1236
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,727
Did you check the records
in Michigan?

1237
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,165
Yep. But nothing comes up.

1238
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,329
So, I talked to his principal,

1239
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,408
and she says he's the greatest
teacher that they ever had,

1240
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,567
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
but, you know,

1241
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:59,875
that's what people often say
about, um, pedophiles.

1242
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,314
They tend to work around kids.

1243
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,147
They almost always work harder
than everybody else

1244
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,777
so as not arouse suspicion,

1245
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,254
and, uh, they almost always
start early,

1246
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,918
and there's almost always
incest involved.

1247
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:16,660
So you think maybe... maybe
his stepsister was his first victim?

1248
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,926
In more ways than one.

1249
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,025
LAURA: Oh, God.

1250
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,902
MONK: Okay,
I'm gonna dispose of this.

1251
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,635
I don't want anyone else to read it.

1252
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,711
But I don't want you
passing notes, okay?

1253
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,574
This is, like, this is a class.

1254
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,045
We learn in class, okay?

1255
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,911
So, remember that for next time.

1256
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,211
See you at the recital.

1257
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,410
Don't be late.

1258
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:38,747
Go play.

1259
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:47,922
What's wrong with you?

1260
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,591
You've been acting strange
ever since I got back.

1261
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,998
Something wrong at home?

1262
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,263
No.

1263
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,003
Well, I wish you'd tell me what it is

1264
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:04,340
because from that look on your face,
it can't be good.

1265
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,848
Do you promise
you won't laugh at me?

1266
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,076
Of course not.

1267
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:13,985
I got attacked by a ghost.
You said you wouldn't laugh.

1268
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,148
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry.

1269
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:19,091
It's just, really, there's,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

1270
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,491
Yeah, there is, too.

1271
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,789
No one believes me.

1272
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,888
But this ghost, all of a sudden,

1273
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,365
it just attacked me
for no reason at all.

1274
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,631
Okay.
And, um, where did this happen?

1275
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:32,172
Mrs. Dykstra's house.

1276
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,606
And what were you doing there?

1277
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,845
Yes, I remember Elena.

1278
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,039
Oh, she was a complete nightmare.

1279
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:40,978
But you know,

1280
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:44,143
I always felt sorry for her having
Ralph Gitchell for a father.

1281
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:45,844
You could see exactly
where she got it from.

1282
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:49,583
Well, Ralph Gitchell didn't go
around dressed like a slut, did he?

1283
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,659
She was already a slut
in the sixth grade.

1284
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,421
And she stole from me.

1285
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,894
Remember that down jacket
I had when I was 11?

1286
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,022
Yeah, she stole it
and sold it for drugs.

1287
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,125
Oh, Julie, please.
Children that age don't do drugs.

1288
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,534
[Sighs]
You are so naïve.

1289
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,435
So, do you know
what happened to her?

1290
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,303
I hope you don't mind me asking,

1291
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,640
but we were just curious
about the history of the house.

1292
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,611
EVELYN: Well,
it was the strangest thing.

1293
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:15,945
She kept on running away and
getting into trouble with the police.

1294
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,916
This was after Ralph died.

1295
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,577
Then Mrs. Gitchell, the poor thing,

1296
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,383
wanted her real mother
to take her back,

1297
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,889
but she refused to do it.

1298
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:23,787
Smart.

1299
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,190
No, she just didn't have
a lot of money.

1300
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,228
Mexican, you know.

1301
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:31,390
Then, finally, Mrs. Gitchell
had her declared incorrigible

1302
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,469
and sent her to reform school,
and then she ran away from there,

1303
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,833
and nobody ever heard
from her again.

1304
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,667
Probably killed turning a trick.

1305
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,004
Oh, Julie, please,
she was just a child.

1306
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,242
So, you mentioned before that you
thought Kenneth was a pervert.

1307
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:47,907
I mean, I don't know,
that's what you called him, right?

1308
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,984
Do you think he was a molester?

1309
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,916
I think it's very possible.

1310
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,180
EVELYN: That's not true.

1311
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,722
If anyone was molesting her,
it was Ralph Gitchell,

1312
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,223
but not Kenneth.

1313
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,849
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1314
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,258
If it was human
and dressed the way she did,

1315
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:04,855
yes, he definitely would have.

1316
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,231
You're right.

1317
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,498
He's too clever.

1318
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,500
And I can't live with myself
knowing that he's out there

1319
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,941
walking around free,

1320
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:17,943
I can't sleep at night.

1321
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:19,673
Oh, Laura.
Well, you know what?

1322
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,146
Look, I've given notice
at the hospital,

1323
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,944
so, uh, in a couple of weeks,
I'll be here all the time,

1324
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,177
maybe you can sleep better
that way.

1325
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,048
Where are all my ties?

1326
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,643
You know, that's a good idea.

1327
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,087
That's when we'll do it.

1328
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,886
W--, w--, we'll take a trip, okay,

1329
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,153
and we'll go to the mountains
or someplace,

1330
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,092
and we'll check into a hotel, right?

1331
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,893
And then when everybody's asleep,

1332
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,901
we'll drive back to the city,
and we'll kill him.

1333
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:43,498
We'll kill him.

1334
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,264
Why not?

1335
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:45,532
GUY: How?

1336
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,574
LAURA: We'll poison him.

1337
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,076
And we'll have an airtight alibi, too.

1338
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,304
It will take a couple of hours,

1339
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,244
and then we'll drive back up
to the mountains,

1340
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,317
and then in the morning
everybody'll see us checking out.

1341
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,387
Hey, we can't be in two places
at the same time, right?

1342
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,183
GUY: You know what, I am not gonna
have this discussion with you.

1343
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,222
You know what?

1344
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,793
Would you just listen to yourself
for a moment?

1345
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,294
How are we supposed to get away
without anybody hearing the car?

1346
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,920
LAURA: We'll drive two cars up,

1347
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,932
and we'll park one within
walking distance of the hotel.

1348
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,127
GUY: And how are we supposed
to get access to Monk's place?

1349
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:16,898
And what if somebody
sees us there?

1350
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:17,937
And what if he puts up a fight?

1351
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,597
LAURA: Like the fight
you're giving me right now?

1352
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,300
GUY: Yes,
because you're not thinking.

1353
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,967
I'm thinking, Guy!

1354
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:23,737
You're not!

1355
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,006
You know, we both talked about
the police having to rush to judgment,

1356
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,172
you're doing the exact same thing.

1357
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,648
The police aren't gonna
take care of this.

1358
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,345
And he's gonna kill again,
that's just what Kimberly said.

1359
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,445
Kimberly never said
a goddamn thing!

1360
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,284
Yes, she did!

No, we don't know
who that is or what.

It's Kimberly, of course,
it's Kimberly.

You want to make me
so mad that I'll...

Well, it won't work.

01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:32,862
Will you, uh, excuse me.
Just, just a second.

1402
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:39,229
Yes? Hello?

1403
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,308
FEMALE VOICE:
Come home.

1404
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,569
Who is this?

1405
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,771
FEMALE:
Monk's in the house.

1406
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,212
Laura, is that you?

1407
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,215
TV ANNOUNCER:
It won't open and shut properly.

1408
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,152
It'll swing open and stay open,
or it'll swing shut.

[Grunts]

1410
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:05,393
Laura, pick up the phone.

1411
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,491
I know you're there,
pick up the phone.

1412
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,664
GUY: [On answering machine]
I just want to make sure you're okay.

1413
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:14,105
Um, please pick up
the goddamn phone!

1414
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,806
Go to hell.

1415
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,988
What about scarring?
Is she gonna be scared for life?

1416
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,187
Huh? Is there something
that I can do?

1417
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,388
Yeah, there's something
you can do.

1418
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,556
You can get a job
with regular hours,

1419
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:38,962
so you can keep
a better eye on your kid.

1420
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,627
Excuse me, rudeness.

1421
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,804
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1422
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:46,806
I, I'm having some trouble at home.
I, I apologize.

1423
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:48,466
Yeah. Trouble at home.

1424
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,440
GUY: Don't move, sweetie.

1425

I knew it.
I knew you were here.

1431
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:05,349
Just put the gun down.

1432
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:08,013
No. You killed my daughter.

1433
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,214
No, I never touched Kimberly.

1434
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,951
Oh, yes, you did, you liar.

1435
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:11,957
But I didn't.

1436
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:12,890
Yes, you did.

1437
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:14,757
It's Elena. She's back.
Don't you understand?

1438
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:16,022
My mother, she tried to tell me that.

1439
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,189
Put the gun down.
I'll explain everything.

1440

[Siren]

1441
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,736
See, Elena, she wasn't
like a normal child.

1442
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:32,074
Her and her father,
they were both pure evil.

1443
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,614
But my mother,
she was too good, you see.

1444
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,617
Even after Ralph died, she refused
to throw Elena out in the street.

1445
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,084
You were molesting her.

1446
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,415
No, she seduced me.

1447
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,854
Why don't you people
ever have anything good to eat?

1448
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,722
Oh, well, I hear they have
really good food in jail.

1449
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,592
You know, I think you are
really gonna like jail, Kenneth.

1450
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,723
And I think those big old black guys
are gonna like you a lot.

1451
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,701
Kenneth, call the police.

1452
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:59,204
You are going right back
where you came from, little lady.

1453
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:02,276
I'm not gonna put up with your
foolishness not one more minute.

1454
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:04,038
Sorry, I'm not going
back to that place.

1455
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:06,807
I'm leaving, and your are gonna
give me the money to do it with.

1456
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:10,315
Otherwise, your little
lover boy's going to jail.

1457
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,512
That's right.
I know all about you two.

1458
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:17,421
It's too bad Mr. Kenneth
never told you about me.

1459
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,524
MRS. GITCHELL:
What is she talking about?

1460
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,187
Oh, go on, Kenneth.

1461
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,098
It's perfectly normal for a man your
age to sleep with a 15-year-old.

1462
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,362
Bet all the weirdoes are doing it.

1463
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,961
Even if we had given her
the money,

1464
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,563
it wouldn't have made
any difference.

1465
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:36,838
She just wanted more
and more and more so...

1466
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:37,933
So what?

1467
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,537
MONK: So we had no choice.

1468
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,143
MONK:
She wasn't like a normal child.

1469
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,956
She, she, she was a killer herself,
she killed our animals.

1470
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,618
She stole, she lied,
and she's trying to do it again,

1471
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:27,695
she's tryin' to convince you

1472
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:29,285
that I killed Kimberly
when I know I didn't.

1473
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:31,160
Don't you dare say her name.

1474
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,130
MONK: But I didn't do anything
to Kimberly.

1475
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:33,893
Liar.

1476
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,195
I'm gonna take her now,

1477
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,931
and I'm gonna put her somewhere
where she can't hurt you,

1478
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,202
or me or anyone ever again.

I hope that's not another cat.

No, no, no, no, no,
it's just a little present.

1507
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:23,969
I realize it isn't much,
but after all you did.

1508
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:24,867
I didn't do that much.

1509
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,803
Oh, yes, you really did.

1510
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,138
If you hadn't have told the police
it was self-defense,

Guy could have gotten
into so much trouble.

1512

Well, it was self-defense in a way.

1513
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:33,570
Well.

1514
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,546
Well, come inside,
let's see what you got.

1515
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,951
Ooh, a present...

1516
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:42,783
Oh, that is really good stuff.

1517
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,448
Now, you, you shouldn't have.

1518
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,221
Hey, why don't you come on in
and help me do a little taste test?

1519
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:48,693
Oh, no, no, I really can't.

1520

tomorrow morning,

so much packing to do.

Where'd you say
you were going to?

1523
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:55,633
Aberdeen, Oregon.

1524
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,363
What the hell
are you gonna do there?

1525
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:59,098
Sweetheart,
you're gonna get bored to death.

1526
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:01,800
No, no.
I think it's gonna be okay.

1527
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,707
Guy's brother is there, and Guy's
gonna start his private practice,

1528
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,212
and after everything
that's gone on here,

1529
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:08,782
I think we need a change of pace.

1530
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,077
Eh, you're probably right.

1531

Uh, Laura.

1533
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,252
You never told me.

1534
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:21,590
Do you still think Monk
killed your daughter?

1535
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:24,831
I don't think we'll ever know
for sure.

1536
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,866
But he killed someone's child.

1537
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,994
We made good and sure
he won't do it again.
