00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,854
Nicole,
save some hot water for your dad!

2
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,475
- Mr. Walker.
- Larry.

3
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,611
I've eaten meaner dogs than you
for breakfast, you wimp!

4
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,710
- Did you get the tickets yesterday?
- Huh?

5
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,552
- The Pier? James Taylor?
- Oh, shit!

6
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,649
I'll have Eddie
get 'em today.

7
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,022
- What?
- Nothin'.

8
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,968
Dad, you're looking at me like you
didn't know who I was or something.

9
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,699
No, no, no. I was just thinking
that maybe you'd...

10
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,832
like Laura to take you
to buy new clothes.

11
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,537
What she's got on
is brand-new.

12
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,274
- This is new?
- Yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

13
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,010
It looks like something you wore
when you were 12.

14
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,518
- Yeah, so?
- Look.

15
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,283
All I'm saying
is that it's... it's...

16
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,916
What? I'm not allowed
to have an opinion?

17
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,586
No, Dad, you're allowed to do
whatever you want to do.

18
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,187
I'm the one who has to ask
permission to breathe.

19
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,289
Can I go to school now, Father?

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,300
Have a nice day, Nicole.

21
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,099
Does that count
as quality time?

22
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,939
- Good boy, Kaiser.
- Drink all your juice, sweetheart.

23
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,950
- Congratulations. I heard you won your game last night.
- Spanked 'em.

24
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,385
- I bet that made your dad happy.
- He doesn't really watch the games.

25
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,389
He's too busy trying
to pick up chicks.

26
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,627
I gotta go.

27
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,427
Could you drop me off
at school?

28
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,127
The Mustang's way cooler
than Mom's car.

29
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,464
Please, Dad.

30
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,475
- Okay, hurry up. Get your stuff.
- All right!

31
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,439
He called me "Dad. "

32
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,858
- Morning, Eddie.
- Mm-hmm.

33
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,089
The Sweikert project
went to the bad guys last night.

34
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,097
- You're shittin' me.
- Wish I were.

35
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:29,431
We're on thin ice here, pal.
Vancouver or bust.

36
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,336
Show me the drafts we got.
I'll create the presentation myself.

37
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,136
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- We shouldn't be doing this.

38
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,110
We're just gonna have to turn around and
come back the second we get there.

39
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,512
Yes, but we can say we were there.
Factor in the residual coolness.

40
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,983
Sorry. Mr. Keheela had to stare
at my boobs for 10 minutes...

41
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,350
before he'd give me
an extension.

42
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,424
We should just get
something to go, guys.

43
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,484
Nicole, chill. What do you want
to remember five years from now?

44
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,190
Being on time for English Lit
or having a life?

45
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,562
Well, let me see.
English Lit, life.

46
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,567
- English Lit.
- Shut up, Gary.

47
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,580
Come along and take a ride

48
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,582
With the one
that's got a life

49
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,016
Just leave
your cares behind

50
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,486
Right now it's party time

51
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,785
Come along and take a ride

52
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,087
With the one
that's got a life

53
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,594
Just leave
your cares behind

54
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,099
- Right now it's party time
- Yo, get up, stand up Put your hands up

55
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,103
In the air like you just don't care
You can put down your gun

56
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,105
- Ooh la la!
- Yes?

57
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,164
- Smoked turkey and gouda on a roll.
- To go.

58
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,176
Ow-oo!

59
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,508
So pretty? Davey,
you see me hole that?

60
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,283
God, stop being so obvious.
What do you wanna eat?

61
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,115
Um, just some
chocolate cake, please.

62
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,121
- To go.
- To go.

63
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,681
Swing and a miss. You're outta
here, buddy. Batter up, Davey.

64
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,434
Come along
and take a ride

65
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,700
With the one
that's got a life

66
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,299
Just leave
your cares behind

67
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,811
- Right now it's party time
- Ah-ha, whoo!

68
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,245
Winning is
a good thing, man.

69
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,249
This is what
we're gonna do

70
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,944
We'll leave the guns
and the knives at home

71
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,648
We'll only get busy on the microphone
with no static

72
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,282
- "King and Occidental"?
- I'm there.

73
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,417
- Down by the docks?
- Yeah. So?

74
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,587
- Better bring your Uzi.
- That's $8.75.

75
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,597
- I got it.
- Come with me.

76
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,600
I can't. I've got a family outing.
James Taylor at the Pier.

77
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,104
- Yikes! Isn't he bald?
- Probably.

78
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,299
Gotta go, guys.

79
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,808
Margo, come on.

80
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,811
All right, all right.

81
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,481
It won't stop
It won't ever quit

82
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,646
'Cause wild-ass kids
are for the bids

83
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,316
Sick and tired of
killin' one another

84
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,655
Each man teachin' one
that we'll all be brothers

85
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,925
- God, I'd bet it'd be a rush.
- You wouldn't really do it.

86
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,533
Why not?

87
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,934
Who wouldn't want millions
of guys fantasizing about them?

88
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,605
- It's power.
- It's nuts.

89
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,738
What, it doesn't
feel good to be wanted?

90
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,943
Hey, what about Jason Fuller?
He wants you bad.

91
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,320
He doesn't want me.
He just...

92
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,850
I don't really know
what he wants.

93
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,723
Every time I go out with him, I feel
like I should be paid for baby-sitting.

94
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,889
Come with me tonight. There's sure
to be something going on down there.

95
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,765
I told you, I gotta
do this family thing.

96
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,068
I'm leaving now. There's food in
the fridge and money on the counter.

97
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,076
If you need to reach me, I'll be at the
St. Francis under Vince's name, okay?

98
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,840
- Okay, Mom.
- Be good. Love you.

99
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,210
- Who's Vince?
- Some old coot in San Francisco...

100
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,218
with a potbelly
and a lotta dough.

101
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,278
He promised her a Mercedes.

102
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:14,087
Which means I get the Rabbit.
Don't you just love life?

103
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,288
Nicole?
Your father's here to pick you up.

104
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,093
Oh, yeah.
Life's just great.

105
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,602
- Dad?
- Daughter.

106
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,698
Is it absolutely mandatory
that I see James Taylor again?

107
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
When did you ever see
a James Taylor concert?

108
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,805
You, me, Mom,
summer of '85.

109
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,341
- Does that ring any bells?
- '85?

110
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,581
- You'd have been...
- Six.

111
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,283
That doesn't count.
I'm surprised you even remember it.

112
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,990
I don't think there's a thing
that's ever happened...

113
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,292
or not happened, for that matter...
that I don't remember.

114
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,856
You're the one
who blocks out the past.

115
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,665
Nicole, I don't
block out anything.

116
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,141
It just takes longer
to sort through 40 years of data...

117
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,143
than it does 16.

118
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,543
Maybe you oughta
consider upgrading to a faster chip.

119
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,585
You know, sometimes
you're pretty funny.

120
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,589
- I have my moments.
- It'll be fun tonight.

121
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,592
You, me, Laura. Toby.

122
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,460
Old memories, new adventures...
It'll be like real life.

123
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,591
Okay, my little sugar plum?

124
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,803
Okay, my little nectarine.

125
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,567
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

126
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,939
Want me to help
with anything?

127
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,741
Yeah. Uh, there's, uh,
fruit in the refrigerator.

128
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,078
- Why don't you get that out? Thanks.
- Okay.

129
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,348
- Mmm. Mmm!
- Mmm. Mmm.

130
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,412
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

131
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,424
Get outta there!

132
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,426
I gotta change
and jump in the shower.

133
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,622
- Call Eddie first. He was looking for you.
- Whoops.

134
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,155
Come on. Not even a nice, schmoozy
conference call? Please.

135
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,772
All right.

136
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,274
What choice do I have?
I'll see you at the airport.

137
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,615
She's got this little chain she hooks
through it and wraps around her waist.

138
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,481
- What would Dad do if I got one?
- You know exactly what he would do.

139
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,544
- Bullet to the brain.
- Toby.

140
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,825
What?

141
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,827
I can't go to the concert.
I gotta go to Vancouver.

142
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,386
- Now?
- I have to meet the client for dinner in three hours.

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,058
Oh, Jesus, Steven.
We've been planning this for weeks.

144
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,125
- The whole thing was your idea.
- Honey, nobody wanted to go more than me.

145
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,536
- What would you like me to do about it?
- Keep your word to your family.

146
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,870
Oh, yeah? Then we can
just all starve to death.

147
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,309
- Spare me the melodrama. Nobody's starving.
- You were right, Dad.

148
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,472
It's just like real life.

149
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,127
Margo.

150
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,755
King and Occidental?
I'm with ya.

151
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,077
There's that guy
from Largo!

152
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,616
Let's go say hi.

153
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,084
Nah, I think I'll just be
over here, okay?

154
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
Hey.

155
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,349
Hi.

156
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,977
You're not dancing.

157
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:37,044
I know.

158
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,122
You aren't either.

159
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,804
- How come?
- How come what?

160
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,274
How come
you're not dancing?

161
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,539
Well, because
nobody's asked me.

162
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,416
Oh.

163
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,855
Come on!

164
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,996
Hey, come on.
Let's get outta here.

165
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,694
Logan!

166
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,094
Logan, come on!

167
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,809
Are you all right?

168
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,368
Yeah. How we
gonna get down?

169
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,380
I'll figure
somethin' out.

170
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,043
Hold on.

171
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:19,222
Come on.

172
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,593
Come on.

173
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,967
I promise. It'll be okay.
It's safe. Come on.

174
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,748
Margo!

175
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,377
I'll see ya later!
Come on!

176
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,824
Go ahead.
Just let go.

177
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,756
It's safe. Come on.

178
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:35,929
Isn't this the car they stopped making 'cause
it, I don't know, blows up or something?

179
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,033
I guess that's why
I got her.

180
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,132
I saw her sittin' there all alone,
cold in the junkyard.

181
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,009
You know, it's not her fault
they didn't put her together right.

182
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,949
You just said that
like you really meant it.

183
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,452
I did.

184
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,865
I stayed with my real mom
in L.A. after my dad moved up here.

185
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,502
I was nine years old.

186
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,207
It was just the two of us,
all alone in this big house.

187
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:23,103
She was so sad most of the time that I
felt like I was the one taking care of her.

188
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,149
Must've been tough.

189
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,746
Yeah.

190
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:36,692
How 'bout your dad?
You get along with him okay?

191
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,890
I don't know. I only moved
up here about a year ago.

192
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,899
It's not like we even know
each other that well.

193
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,765
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

194
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,304
How 'bout you?
You have parents?

195
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,433
- I mean, that you see and stuff.
- Yeah.

196
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,445
They're back East,
but I talk to them all the time.

197
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,141
Are they still together?

198
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,274
They're weird, though.

199
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,149
I mean, they're totally cool,
totally together.

200
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,155
It's just that they've never had a
disagreement about anything more serious...

201
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:09,592
than whether it's gonna be
mashed or Stove-Top, or tea or coffee.

202
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,425
Kinda crazy.

203
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,801
- What?
- Nothing.

204
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,635
That was not "nothing" going on
behind those beautiful eyes of yours.

205
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,765
Tell me.

206
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,071
I was just thinking that,

207
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:33,243
you're not at all what I expected
you to be the first time I saw you.

208
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,252
How so?

209
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,424
I don't know.
You're just...

210
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,426
You're sweet.

211
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,091
What? You're the one
that's hiding something.

212
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,272
It's just that I was taught that if
something seems too good to be true,

213
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,501
then it probably isn't.

214
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,339
Yeah.

215
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,006
So far what I know about you
is you're beautiful...

216
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,240
and incredibly perceptive.

217
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:10,345
I just need to know like one flaw
so I can believe the rest.

218
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,358
- Got a week?
- Hmm. I got all the time in the world.

219
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,858
Oh. David.

220
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,401
I gotta go.
My curfew's at midnight.

221
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,345
All the time in the world.

222
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,806
David.

223
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,337
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,005
I guess
you found my flaw.

225
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,378
That's not a flaw.

226
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,475
That's one more perfect thing
for me to admire.

227
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,878
And respect.

228
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,225
And wait for.

229
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,425
The least you could have done
was call, Nicole.

230
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,989
I was sitting here for two hours
imagining God knows what.

231
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,900
Laura, I can't help it
if my watch broke.

232
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,202
I mean, how would I even notice unless
I was staring at it every second.

233
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,902
Go to bed, Nicole.
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

234
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,241
- Laura...
- I'm angry, Nicole. Just go to bed.

235
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,376
And take off your makeup.
You look like a slut.

236
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,927
- Mr. Walker.
- Larry.

237
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,925
So, 2:00 a. m.
Am I missin' somethin'?

238
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,032
Come on, Nicky.
Help me out.

239
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,040
Your were kidnapped
by aliens.

240
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:14,044
They tried to take you to their planet, but
you escaped and hitchhiked back from Pluto.

241
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,918
- So who's this guy you were with?
- Just a guy.

242
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,825
- Is he a good guy?
- He's good to his car.

243
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,987
You'd appreciate that.

244
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,497
Well, that's a start.
Maybe I should meet him.

245
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,057
I just met him. I don't know if
I'm gonna see him again.

246
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,262
Oh.

247
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:41,168
So?

248
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,503
Right.

249
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,600
All right, here's the deal.

250
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,311
Kitchen duty and yard work
for two weeks. No exceptions.

251
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,749
And no subcontracting out
to Tobias.

252
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,752
- Is that fair?
- Do I have a choice?

253
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,482
- No.
- I guess it's fair.

254
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:02,151
And... I want you
to apologize to Laura.

255
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:07,494
Yeah. I'll apologize to her when she
apologizes to me for calling me a slut.

256
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,736
You were too easy on her.
She should have been grounded.

257
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,899
She knows she screwed up.

258
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,637
It's all easy fixes
with you, Steve.

259
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,680
You give her whatever she wants, like
you're forever trying to make it up to her.

260
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,874
Please, Laura.

261
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,611
It's gonna blow up
in your face, Steve.

262
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,623
Everybody needs rules. She'd respect you more
if you laid it out and played it straight.

263
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,457
Straight, huh? Is that why
you called her a slut?

264
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,688
I said she looked like
a slut.

265
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,201
She had about two gallons of makeup on.
That's exactly what she looked like.

266
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,294
Shitty choice of words,
don't you think?

267
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,568
Maybe.

268
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,688
Love and hate
Get it wrong

269
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:09,590
Just cut me right back
down to size

270
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,061
Sleep through the day
Let it fade

271
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,930
Who was there
to take your place

272
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,799
No one knows
Never will

273
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,397
Mostly me
but mostly you

274
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,966
Do you say
Do you do

275
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:30,104
When it all comes down

276
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:34,277
'Cause I don't wanna come back
down from this cloud

277
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,680
It's taken me
all this time

278
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:41,020
To find out what I need
Yeah

279
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:47,522
I don't wanna come back down
from this cloud

280
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,834
It's taken me all this
all this time

281
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,896
You know, every part
of you tastes so good.

282
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:06,049
- Nicole?
- Yeah?

283
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:09,143
I wanna meet
your family.

284
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,711
- Really?
- Yeah. Will that be okay?

285
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:14,757
Yeah.

286
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,553
Dad, meet David McCall.

287
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,899
Mr. Walker.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

288
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,764
Same here, David.

289
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:27,895
Hey, Toby, right?
What's up, big guy?

290
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:30,998
This must be
the savage beast Kaiser.

291
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,837
- Aah.
- That means he likes ya.

292
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,313
Yeah? Tell him
the feeling is mutual.

293
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,873
You know, you look bigger
than your sister described.

294
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:44,318
Or maybe you just grew
since yesterday. Which one?

295
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:47,118
So, David, you're not
in school with Nicole, are you?

296
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:51,025
Um, no, sir.
But maybe U-Doub in the fall.

297
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,689
I'm just kinda explorin'
my options, I guess.

298
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:56,756
Nicole, remember you gotta help me
plant these trees before you leave.

299
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,428
But I gotta get changed.

300
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:01,835
Well, you knew it was
one of your chores.

301
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,840
Excuse me.
It's Laura, right?

302
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,138
Hi, I'm David. I...

303
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,544
I don't wanna interfere, but it so
happens I work summers in a nursery.

304
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:13,481
- I'd be happy to give you a hand.
- Can I help too?

305
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:17,351
I couldn't do it
without you, partner.

306
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,514
Okay. Come on.
Grab the big one.

307
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,084
The main thing is the moisture content
of the soil when you first plant it.

308
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,356
These guys' roots are really sensitive
for about ten days.

309
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,060
Well, you certainly learned
a lot during your summer, didn't you?

310
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:42,438
Is there someplace
I can get cleaned up?

311
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:46,449
I don't know. Hard-earned dirt under
a man's fingernails can be attractive.

312
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:48,485
Maybe I shouldn't wash.

313
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,486
- It's in there, on your left.
- Thanks.

314
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:53,045
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Walker.
I was looking for the bathroom.

315
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,024
Uh, it's right in there.

316
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,356
- I'm not disturbing you, am I?
- No, no. Go ahead.

317
00:24:57,428 --> 00:24:59,692
Thank you.

318
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,756
Did David come in here?

319
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,926
- I'll be right out.
- Margo.

320
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,596
Come on in.
Tell me about life.

321
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:12,665
Mr. Walker, I'm sure you know
a lot more about life than I do.

322
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,836
I wouldn't be so sure.
I get surprised at least once a day.

323
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:17,779
- That's the fun part, though, isn't it, Mr. Walker?
- Depends, David.

324
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:21,340
Kinda cuts both ways.
You just never know.

325
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:24,410
- Two minutes.
Those trash bags have to go out.

326
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:27,685
- You're not gettin' out of that.
- All right.

327
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:30,352
You should come with us
to the Orbit. It'd be fun.

328
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,593
- Nicole! Get me a Coke.
- Yeah?

329
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:36,724
Okay, I'll be right there.

330
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:41,329
Come on, Steve.
You could play pinball.

331
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:44,272
You could ride
the bumper cars.

332
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:47,799
You could do that thing where
you throw the ball at something...

333
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:51,405
and maybe win me a stuffed animal.

334
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,246
Or you could
just walk around,

335
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:57,116
eating cotton candy,
checking everybody out.

336
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:01,748
Hey, thank you.
You almost ready?

337
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,760
- Mm-hmm.
- I wanna get there before dark.

338
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,922
- We still gotta pick Logan up. Hurry, okay?
- Okay. Let me grab my jacket.

339
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,624
Okay.

340
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,594
David.

341
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:17,130
Nicole's curfew is 12:00,
not five after, all right?

342
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,971
All right.

343
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,774
Hello.

344
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,906
Yeah, Eddie.

345
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:30,718
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Walker. Take care.

346
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,120
No, I'm finishing them up
right now.

347
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,124
I'm gonna drop 'em off
at FedEx myself.

348
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,229
I'm not gonna miss it. It'll get there.

349
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,132
- Nicole!
- All right, Eddie. I'll see ya.

350
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,831
Nicole!

351
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:56,135
You let her leave?

352
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:02,048
- Steven.
- Why don't you get your helpmate to do it?

353
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,520
What, Eddie?

354
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:23,370
Childhood living

355
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:29,308
Is easy to do

356
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:36,376
The things
that you wanted

357
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,819
I bought them for you

358
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,922
Graceless lady

359
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:55,129
You know who I am

360
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,773
You know I can't let you

361
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:08,082
Just slide
through my hands

362
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:14,556
And wild horses

363
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:20,654
Couldn't drag me away

364
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,330
Wild horses

365
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:33,604
Couldn't drag me away

366
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,242
Faith has been broken

367
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:49,425
And tears must be cried

368
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:55,959
Let's do some living

369
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:03,899
Oh, after we die

370
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:09,637
Wild horses

371
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:14,716
Couldn't drag me away

372
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:21,484
Wild, wild horses

373
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,188
Couldn't drag me away

374
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:35,804
Wild, wild horses

375
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:40,810
We'll ride them someday

376
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:55,449
Eddie, I'm sealin' the envelope,
I'm out the door.

377
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:01,027
What are you talkin' about?
The last pickup's not until 7:00.

378
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:04,067
I still got
half an hour. What?

379
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:09,070
Shit!

380
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,411
There you go, kid.
Take your best shot.

381
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:19,439
Bull's-eye will get you
anything on the wall.

382
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,082
- We got a winner.
- I'll take that peace pipe.

383
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,681
You look like a basketball player.

384
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,727
Take a shot.

385
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:39,391
I screwed up. I gotta
go back up to Vancouver.

386
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,630
Bye-bye.

387
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,764
I want you to come with me.

388
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,299
We could stay
in that same hotel.

389
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,809
Maybe even get
that same suite.

390
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:58,112
The number
of the hotel is by the phone.

391
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:01,680
So just rent some videos, call Domino's,
and try not to kill each other.

392
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,921
- I'll try and restrain myself.
- I'll sic Kaiser on you.

393
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:07,190
- Ooh-whoo.
- Ooh, I'm shaking.

394
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,356
Try and have a nice time, Nic.
Life is short.

395
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,297
Nobody in the house
but you and Toby.

396
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:13,529
- I hear you, Dad.
- Smile?

397
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:20,574
- Hello.
- David?

398
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:25,137
- Nicole, how are you?
- I'm good. Listen.

399
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:28,742
David, my parents went out
of town for a couple of days,

400
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:30,979
and I'm all alone
in my room.

401
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,722
- Nicole.
- Yes, David?

402
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:38,454
- I promised some friends I'd help 'em out with somethin' tonight.
- Oh.

403
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:42,624
- Um, okay. Whatever.
- But, Nicole.

404
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,634
- Yeah?
- I could come by afterwards.

405
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,636
- Would that be okay?
- Sure.

406
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:49,638
If it gets too late,
I might be in bed.

407
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:53,642
Okay? So just punch 1-4-3-2 into
the keypad and just come on in.

408
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,644
I'll be waiting.

409
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:33,102
Hey.

410
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,654
David.

411
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,601
Nicole.

412
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,606
I love you.

413
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,562
Please don't tell Margo.
Not that it's a secret or anything.

414
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,766
I just...
I don't know, it...

415
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,775
Are we talkin'
the "L" word here?

416
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:16,345
I don't know.

417
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:19,905
Whatever it is,
I definitely never felt it before.

418
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,918
Prince Charming
must be late.

419
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,615
- Do you want me to wait?
- No, that's all right. He'll be here.

420
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,033
David, what the hell
are you doing? Stop it!

421
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,544
Stop it!
Stop it!

422
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:56,382
What? Come on.

423
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,648
Go away!

424
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,721
Get away from me!

425
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,762
Just leave us alone.

426
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,881
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

427
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,554
- Who is it?
- Can I come in?

428
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,114
- Um...
- I, uh...

429
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,093
I thought of you when I saw
this in the hotel gift shop.

430
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,630
Oh, Nicole,
what happened?

431
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:45,294
I was in gym class. We were playing volleyball,
and I caught an elbow right in the eye.

432
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,600
Oh. Well...

433
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,267
Let's see
what we can do.

434
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,541
- Those are pretty shoes.
- Thank you.

435
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,574
Hey there. Doesn't your daughter look
exceptionally pretty today?

436
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,643
Uh-huh.

437
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,485
Oh, hey, yeah.
You look lovely, Nic.

438
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,582
Thanks, Dad.
I gotta go.

439
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,560
Can I get a kiss?

440
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,896
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Nic.

441
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,435
Thanks, Laura.

442
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,965
- What was that about?
- Woman stuff.

443
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,671
She got a black eye in gym class,
so I gave her a makeup lesson.

444
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,680
So she wouldn't
look like a slut.

445
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,681
Hey.

446
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,417
Talk to Travis Bickle yet?

447
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,584
I don't think I ever
wanna see him again.

448
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,655
Are you okay?

449
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,257
Did you see the look in his eye?

450
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:55,271
I can't get it out of my head.
Gave me goddamn nightmares.

451
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,603
I'm sorry, Gary.

452
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,700
I'm just so incredibly confused.

453
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,195
Hey, I'm a murderous
murder man

454
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,561
Comin' from a bad land
Real hard-core

455
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,566
Kickin' down
your front door

456
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,568
Let me get
what's comin' to me

457
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,628
'Cause if I can't use my mind
I'm gonna grab the...

458
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,416
Uh, we're here to see
a man about a dog.

459
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,511
- Does this look like a kennel?
- I, uh... W-We...

460
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:49,625
Woof, woof, woof.

461
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,724
All right, wait in here.
But don't be fooled. He's on red alert.

462
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,502
They're interested
in the dog.

463
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,565
Go tell David
we have to leave soon.

464
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:10,341
Holy smoke, Beaver!

465
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,950
Hey, man.

466
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:17,509
What the hell
you doin' in here?

467
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,786
- Not now, Knobby.
- Logan says we gotta leave soon.

468
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,259
Tell Logan I'm not goin'.

469
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,729
Oh, yeah? Well, he's gonna be pissed,
man. You've been bailin' a lot.

470
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,900
When his old man
gets back into town,

471
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,993
we're all gonna be
out on our ass.

472
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,061
You better start
thinkin' about that.

473
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,757
You're welcome.

474
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,759
Hey, Nicole.

475
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,429
You got a fan.

476
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,206
Thanks.

477
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,634
Never mind.

478
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,877
Steve, let me go?

479
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,022
Were the flowers
from him?

480
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,427
Yeah.

481
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,591
It's just like him,
you know?

482
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,367
He's always so polite
and considerate.

483
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,736
He never has to show off
the way other guys do.

484
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,537
Then all of a sudden
he turns into a monster.

485
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,874
I mean, Gary was down
on the ground, and David...

486
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:24,846
just kept on kicking him
and kicking him so hard!

487
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,213
Did he give you
the black eye too?

488
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,145
Did he?

489
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:36,258
Dad, I told you
how I got the black eye.

490
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,531
Steven, why don't you
let us finish up here?

491
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,200
Toss me the Kleenex?

492
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:07,420
Nicole, I want you to understand that whatever
you think I may have done to disappoint you...

493
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:11,393
is no reason for you
to go screw up your whole life.

494
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:13,429
What?

495
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,465
Dad, I don't know what
you're talking about.

496
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,466
That's what worries me.

497
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,638
Look, Dad, this may come
as a big shock to you,

498
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,641
but every move I make
does not have to do with you.

499
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,940
- Turns out I'm living my own life.
- Not yet you're not.

500
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:31,378
As long as you're living in my house,
you'll follow my rules.

501
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,849
That means when you wanna go out, I wanna
know where you're going and with who.

502
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:37,751
- And if I don't like it, you're not going.
- Don't be ridiculous, Dad.

503
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,757
- I'm not kidding, Nicole. This is gonna stop!
- What?

504
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,952
Why don't you just say it?
This is all about David.

505
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:46,291
- There's something wrong with him.
- That's your problem, not mine.

506
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,490
- He's not a good guy.
- Look, Dad.

507
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:51,227
David and I had
a disagreement.

508
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,496
Maybe we'll get past it,
maybe we won't.

509
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,998
But no matter what happens,
it'll be between us.

510
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,576
This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

511
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,585
Oh, God!

512
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,469
What the hell
was that about?

513
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,774
Oh, boy.

514
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,709
He hit her too, Laura.
I know he did.

515
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,609
You heard what she said.

516
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,614
I don't care what anybody says.
He hit her.

517
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,276
Fine.

518
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:45,845
But don't think you can bully her into
growing up, Steven. It doesn't work that way.

519
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,804
So he hit ya.

520
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,212
Sometimes that's just their asshole way
of showing they love you.

521
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:15,046
- He didn't mean to hit me. It was an accident.
- Fine.

522
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:19,054
- So then what's the problem?
- I don't know.

523
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:23,650
Do yourself a favor and don't think so
much. It gives you premature wrinkles.

524
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,025
My dad hates him,
that's for sure.

525
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,065
Well, that means that he knows
you're sleeping together.

526
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,430
You know, it's that usual
weirdo jealously trip.

527
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,163
How could he possibly know
we were sleeping together?

528
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:38,867
Caught ya, ya ho! You never told
me you were screwin' him!

529
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,968
Ach! Tch. You'll always
remember your first.

530
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,840
Not your second,
not your third.

531
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,679
Just your first.

532
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,345
- Party!
- Oh, shit!

533
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,911
No! No! Logan!

534
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:55,457
- Don't you dare!
- Goin' in.

535
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:12,598
Nicole. Nicole.

536
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,611
Just give me one minute?

537
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,112
I know you never
wanna see me again,

538
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:27,588
but I still
have to explain.

539
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:30,820
There's nothin' that I can say
that'll make what I did all right.

540
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,488
I know that, but I need you to know
that it came from someplace good.

541
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:37,124
It came from me feelin' like
I'd do anything to protect you.

542
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,634
- From Gary?
- I didn't know it was Gary.

543
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,901
I swear. All I saw was some guy
with his paws all over you.

544
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:47,171
I mean, knowin' how many
bad guys are out there...

545
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,475
guys that would take
advantage of somebody like you.

546
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,482
Guys that I would kill if they
ever did anything to hurt you.

547
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:57,817
I just lost it.

548
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,822
I want you to know...

549
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,054
that I'm very sorry about
what happened to Gary, I am.

550
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:06,288
But I can't be sorry
that I love you.

551
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,057
I learned from you,
Nicole, I really did.

552
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:14,433
I learned that I need people
more than I thought.

553
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:18,338
I've always been the one
takin' care of things.

554
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,376
And with you,
it's different.

555
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,637
And I want us to
take care of each other.

556
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:28,550
And I'll promise nothin' like that
will ever happen again.

557
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,492
I'm sorry.

558
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,596
I'm home.

559
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:53,103
Laura?

560
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:09,522
- No! No, no, no.
- Come here. Oh, yes, yes.

561
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:18,833
Hey there! Isn't this
Indian summer great?

562
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,166
- What's goin' on?
- Well, it's warm.

563
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:23,865
We're taking advantage.
You oughta jump in.

564
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,307
What's he doin' here?

565
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,937
What's he doin' here, Laura?

566
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:35,709
Steven, would you rather
she lied and snuck off to see him?

567
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,852
You made the rules.

568
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,714
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

569
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:11,085
- Hello.
- You remember that song and dance Nicole gave us...

570
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:14,089
about David growing up like Beaver Cleaver
in some perfect little town back East?

571
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,284
- Yeah, something like that.
- Well, guess again.

572
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:19,556
The kid bounced from foster home
to foster home to institution...

573
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,359
until he was finally kicked out
on his ass at 18.

574
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,366
Since then, no one knows.

575
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,892
He's got no family, no address,
no work record... nothin'.

576
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,769
All right. So the guy's embarrassed
about being an orphan.

577
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,808
Not his fault, by the way.

578
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:36,642
So he makes up a story about having
a happy childhood to impress a girl.

579
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:40,774
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal, Laura, is that the guy give me the creeps...

580
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,909
and the girl
is my daughter.

581
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,192
- Hello, David.
- Hi, Mr. Walker.

582
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:34,669
- You got a minute? I need to talk to you.
- I'm meeting Nicole.

583
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:36,705
This won't take long.

584
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:40,808
- All right.
- Follow me around the corner.

585
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:01,656
David, I don't want
to beat around the bush.

586
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:04,199
I came to tell you that
you're gonna stop seeing Nicole.

587
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:08,635
Now, either you're as smart as you think
you are and you'll just go away,

588
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:11,502
or else you're gonna make things harder
on yourself than they have to be.

589
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:15,403
You know, Steve,
you're really not a faggot.

590
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:19,610
- What?
- I'm serious.

591
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:22,412
Seem like a pretty solid guy.
You should lighten up on yourself.

592
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:25,784
- We're not talkin' about me. We're talkin' about...
- Yes, we are.

593
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:29,018
That's what this whole thing's
about, Steve. Your inadequacies.

594
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:30,922
- Your fears.
- You just wait a minute.

595
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:35,930
Listen to me. See, I'm hip
to your problems. All of 'em.

596
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:41,527
I know you abandoned Nicole when she needed
you most... 'cause I licked her sweet tears.

597
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:46,098
I know about things comin' apart at work.
Maybe you fuckin' lost it in that department.

598
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,744
I also know you ain't
keepin' up, so to speak,

599
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:52,280
your end of the bargain
with the missus.

600
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:55,408
'Cause if you were,
she wouldn't be all over my stick.

601
00:50:55,484 --> 00:50:59,420
Relax, Steve.
We're friends.

602
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:01,615
We're practically family.

603
00:51:04,493 --> 00:51:07,257
I want you to understand
something, pal.

604
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:10,389
If you don't disappear from my family's
life, I'm gonna rip your balls off...

605
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:13,094
and shove 'em so far up your ass
they'll come out your fuckin' mouth!

606
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,763
You got that, my friend?

607
00:51:38,494 --> 00:51:40,462
Steve, what I'm saying is,

608
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:44,090
even if he's got a record and we can convince
a judge, this thing could still backfire.

609
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:47,602
You tell some kid that the state is
restraining him, you'll make him want it more.

610
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,298
We've gotta do something.
I'm not gonna just sit around.

611
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:52,636
Let me ask you something
as your friend.

612
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,973
Are you sure you're not just
fighting the inevitable here?

613
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:58,980
You didn't expect she
was gonna stay a virgin, did you?

614
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:01,915
Alex, the guy
is a psychopath.

615
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:03,918
Because he's hot
for your daughter?

616
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:06,454
Took a jealous swing at some guy,
talked trash to you?

617
00:52:06,522 --> 00:52:10,288
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- Yeah, of course.

618
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,293
I'll make a couple of calls
for you, all right?

619
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,355
- Where's my father?
- He's in his workroom.

620
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:25,540
You know, Dad, I never expect you
to be perfect, 'cause I know I'm not.

621
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,803
But I never thought
you were a hypocrite until now.

622
00:52:27,877 --> 00:52:30,038
Honey, calm down.
What are you talking about?

623
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,740
I'm talking about you lecturing me
about what David did to Gary,

624
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,875
and then turning around and acting
a million times worse yourself.

625
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:39,887
- I don't know what he told you...
- He didn't have to tell me anything. I saw the bruises.

626
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:43,652
- What bruises?
- You're gonna tell me that you never touched him,

627
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:46,695
that you didn't hit him so hard in
the chest that he's sore and bruised?

628
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:49,856
- Look, I-I may have...
- Yeah, exactly, Dad.

629
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:53,459
You may have. But I'll tell you
what you definitely did.

630
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,562
You lost my respect.

631
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,402
Nicole, come back here!

632
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:02,869
Nicole!

633
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,014
Nicole!

634
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,858
Fuck!

635
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:41,613
She ran to the car, she got in, and she slammed
the door in my face, if you need to know.

636
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:46,113
What?

637
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:48,622
What are you talkin' about?
She's only 16.

638
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:53,884
So what if she wasn't kidnapped?
I still have the right to... Huh?

639
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:58,332
Fine, I'll call a lawyer!

640
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:03,126
Just you and me, Nicole.
Nobody else.

641
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:05,605
Nobody else.

642
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:07,665
Mmm.

643
00:54:07,743 --> 00:54:09,938
- Do you want me?
- Yes.

644
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:13,748
Tell me.

645
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:15,977
Tell me you want me.

646
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:23,255
- I want you, David.
- Yeah?

647
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,763
- David.
- Yeah?

648
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:31,766
I love you.

649
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,897
And wild horses

650
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:45,070
Couldn't drag me away

651
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:50,716
- And wild horses
- Sure you won't change your mind and come home with me?

652
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:54,779
I can't.
My dad will kill me.

653
00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:57,792
Okay. I love you.

654
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:01,392
- Bye.
- Bye.

655
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:34,792
I woke up wanting you

656
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:37,923
But you are rarely there

657
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:44,029
I howl a song
and I prowl at dawn

658
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:47,041
I growl but you don't care

659
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:50,401
Growl

660
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:57,075
I see you walking
around like that

661
00:55:57,152 --> 00:56:00,553
With that animal
on your back

662
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:11,298
I woke up wanting you

663
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:16,031
- But you are rarely there - Get outta
here, you skinny-ass motherfucker!

664
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:20,439
I howl a song
and I prowl at dawn

665
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:23,444
I growl but you don't care

666
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,747
Growl

667
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:32,082
- Come on.
- Hey, fuck you. She's mine.

668
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,549
You want me?

669
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:42,630
Say it
so he can hear you.

670
00:56:42,698 --> 00:56:44,689
Go ahead.
Tell him.

671
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:48,760
Tell him you want me.
Tell him! Now!

672
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:51,635
I want him!

673
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:03,478
Yeah, fuck it. Keep that
dirty little bitch. I don't want her.

674
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,263
What?

675
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:44,746
- Nic.
- Please, Dad. I don't wanna talk about it.

676
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,523
I just wanna be alone.

677
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,959
Okay.

678
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:10,435
The pain'll go away, honey.
I promise.

679
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,784
Is she okay?

680
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,087
I hope so.

681
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:37,469
I got you some anyway. I thought food
might zap you out of your zombie trip.

682
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,101
- Thanks. I'm just not hungry.
- Let me guess.

683
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:44,635
You're preparing a junk food defense before
you and your boyfriend go on a killing spree.

684
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,409
No. Definitely not.

685
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,144
Joke. Joke, Nicole.

686
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,620
As in "ha-ha. "
Remember?

687
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,681
Jesus, cane me in Singapore.

688
00:59:55,758 --> 01:00:00,457
- Was Margo in bio? - Uh-uh.
She called and said she was sick.

689
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,021
- At least she's honest.
- What?

690
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:07,160
- Nothing.
- Speak of the devil.

691
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,006
- Guess who?
- Don't touch me!

692
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,008
Nicole, where are you going?

693
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,601
- Get away from me! Help!
- Get over here. Stop it!

694
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,703
- Somebody help me!
- What's the matter with you? Come here.

695
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,873
- Hey!
- Just stay away from me!

696
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,385
- No. Why?
- You heard her David. Just let her go!

697
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:28,390
All right? Okay?

698
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,361
All right.

699
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,363
Okay.

700
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,877
- Hey. They're in there.
- Hi. Thanks.

701
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,382
Why won't you
take my calls?

702
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:02,550
As you can see, I'm playing
with my little brother.

703
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:06,823
Okay. You don't have to
be so snotty about it.

704
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:10,457
Hey there, handsome. When you
gonna grow up so I can ravage you?

705
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,798
Margo, why don't you
leave Toby alone?

706
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,033
Jesus.
What's your problem?

707
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:32,042
What?

708
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:36,455
The fact that you can stand there and act
cool and fine as if nothing ever happened.

709
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:41,759
That's what scares me
the most about you, Margo.

710
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:47,098
It's like I don't know you, or... Maybe
I don't know anybody for that matter.

711
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,968
- Everybody says one thing and then does another.
- Nicole.

712
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,408
I... I'm sorry. I just... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

713
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,313
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

714
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,659
Who told you?
Did David tell you?

715
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,094
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
You're not a friend of mine.

716
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:18,930
Nicole, I was high, okay?
He forced me. He made me do it!

717
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:23,335
Nicole, please don't do this.
Please don't do this. I need you.

718
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,933
You're my only friend!

719
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,662
Hey, pull over!
I gotta talk to you!

720
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:19,017
- What the fuck do ya think you're doin'?
- David, please leave me alone.

721
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:22,113
- Huh? What did you say to Nicole?
- Nothing.

722
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:25,990
You fuckin', lyin' fuckin' whore.

723
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:29,360
Get the fuck outta the car!
You lyin' fuckin' whore!

724
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:35,630
What did you say to her?
What the fuck did you say to her?

725
01:04:35,704 --> 01:04:40,141
Nothing. I swear, David. I didn't tell
her. I don't know how she knows.

726
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,233
But she knows.

727
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,413
Let me tell you somethin'. You better
fix it. You better make it right.

728
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:53,215
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna hurt you.

729
01:04:53,288 --> 01:04:56,382
Don't cry.

730
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,619
You fuckin' liked it.

731
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:14,003
Mr. Walker, sir, I believe I owe you,
Nicole and your entire family an apology.

732
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,442
Well, I was wonderin' if...

733
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:21,710
I was just wonderin' if you'd be so kind as
to let me come in and explain a few things?

734
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:23,978
I think you might
understand.

735
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:28,750
I'm not interested
in understanding you, David.

736
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:32,351
I'm only interested in
keeping you away from Nicole.

737
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:35,919
And I'll do whatever it takes
to accomplish that. Okay?

738
01:05:37,532 --> 01:05:40,160
Whatever it takes.

739
01:05:57,953 --> 01:05:59,887
Thanks, Dad.

740
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:04,255
Hello?

741
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:07,955
Oh, hey, Eddie.
Just hold on one second.

742
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,362
Yeah, Eddie?

743
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:14,198
I'm gonna work all night.

744
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:16,203
Please, don't panic.

745
01:07:01,149 --> 01:07:04,277
I talked to the school.
Security knows about everything, so...

746
01:07:04,352 --> 01:07:07,753
Don't worry, Dad.
It's over, okay?

747
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,757
- Love you.
- Love you.

748
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,835
Nicole! Wait up.

749
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,929
- Hi.
- Everything copacetic?

750
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:28,635
Yeah. You know, I never thanked you
for the other day.

751
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,644
No sweat.

752
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:45,750
Yes! You did it! This is great.

753
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:48,421
This is a work of art.

754
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,660
You think you can stay conscious long
enough to crunch out the new numbers?

755
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:54,636
I've been livin' on pure adrenalin
for 24 hours. Why stop now?

756
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:57,101
- Sure you don't want
to come to the mall?

757
01:07:57,171 --> 01:07:59,469
Nah. I gotta finish
that story for the paper.

758
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,068
The Washington Post is gonna need to see
something before they make me editor.

759
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:06,875
- Hey, Laura. - Hey,
Gary. - Get in the back.

760
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:08,916
- Hey, Toby bear.
- Hi, Gary.

761
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:10,917
Okay, I'll see you later.

762
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,769
- Hey, Gary.
- David.

763
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:40,780
- Did you know I grew up in a lot of different places?
- Uh, no. Actually, Nicole told...

764
01:08:40,848 --> 01:08:44,011
Oh, yeah. Bridgewater,
Spaford, Rikers, you name it.

765
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,848
- You know what they have in common?
- No.

766
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,378
Weak walls. Actually, that's why
they moved me around so much.

767
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:51,391
I'd pound on the wall,
it'd break.

768
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:53,518
They'd move me to the next one
and the next one...

769
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:57,155
until finally they got sick of
buildin' walls and showed me the door.

770
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:01,167
Pretty useful upbringing it turned out,
though, Gar. There's always walls.

771
01:09:01,235 --> 01:09:07,003
Usually the moist, fleshy kind that try to get
in the way of me and it, whatever it may be.

772
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:12,138
Silly, silly people, though.
They're only to be knocked down.

773
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:14,238
Gary.

774
01:09:35,937 --> 01:09:38,565
- We ready?
- We're ready?

775
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:42,336
I appreciate your efforts. I know how hard the
push has been on yourselves and your families.

776
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:46,870
Today is just another dog and pony show.
I'll kick it off, and then you're up, Steve.

777
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:49,542
Let's sell these guys.

778
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:52,108
How many tickets we got
for the Hawks Sunday?

779
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:56,088
- We got the four. Peterman kept the rest.
- That figures.

780
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:02,894
Holy shit!

781
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:07,967
Jesus, Steve.

782
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:17,267
What does it say?

783
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:22,715
Eddie, I need for you to give me the keys to
your car and for you to catch a ride with Harvey.

784
01:10:22,784 --> 01:10:25,582
- Steve, we gotta...
- Please!

785
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:30,582
Okay.

786
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:59,251
Hello, Laura? Nicole?
Come on. Somebody pick up.

787
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,757
Shit!

788
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:07,886
Hello, Margo. This is Mr. Walker.
Is Nicole with you?

789
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:11,954
Do you know where
David McCall lives?

790
01:11:37,725 --> 01:11:41,161
How are you?
I need to talk to you.

791
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:43,993
- Help!
- Shh!

792
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:49,526
Shh. You gotta listen to me, Nicole.
To me. The real me.

793
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:53,631
- You gotta use the one thing
you have that can hear the real me.

794
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:58,412
It's not here.
It's not what I say.

795
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:00,970
It's not here.

796
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:03,846
It's not the way
you see me acting.

797
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:06,580
It's here.

798
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:10,488
That's what it is, Nicole. You know it.

799
01:12:10,558 --> 01:12:14,824
I know it. Your daddy knows it.
Everybody knows it.

800
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:19,299
That's why they're tryin' to keep
us apart. They're just jealous.

801
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:23,963
- We have somethin' that
everybody wants but nobody has.

802
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:27,565
- We can't let them
take that away from us, Nicole.

803
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:31,408
It belongs to me and you. Okay?

804
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:38,046
I love you.
I love you.

805
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:44,017
Help!

806
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:46,286
Somebody help me.

807
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:04,158
It's your fucking fault!

808
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:08,100
Come on! Now somebody knows
who did this. Now who is it?

809
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:12,765
- I know who did it.
- Well, I'll fucking kill whoever did this!

810
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,570
- Yeah, who?
- Yeah, let's pay the dude a fuckin' visit, then!

811
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:17,577
All right.

812
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,580
Here.

813
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:30,917
Thanks.

814
01:15:33,661 --> 01:15:38,462
I can't get over the feeling that I let
you down, Nic. I should've seen it coming.

815
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:43,896
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Laura.

816
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,566
Thanks, anyway.

817
01:15:49,644 --> 01:15:53,273
I mean that, on top of the fact that
he assaulted her in a public bathroom,

818
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:57,011
and you're tellin' me that that's
not enough to haul him in?

819
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:00,782
Who gives a shit
about warrants?

820
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:06,157
They're runnin' their own cartel, and
you can't do a goddamn thing about it?

821
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:09,924
Well, look, I'm not worried about tonight,
but what about tomorrow and the next day?

822
01:16:09,997 --> 01:16:12,295
She can't stay here
like she's a prisoner.

823
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,369
Pull in over there.

824
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,939
We'll cut through
the woods.

825
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,824
- An eye for an eye.
- A tooth for a fuckin' tooth!

826
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:46,230
Just remember,
Nicole ain't part of this game.

827
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,582
Ohh, Margo.

828
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:14,389
Ohh, what's wrong?

829
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,788
We...

830
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:24,428
Gary's dead.

831
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:30,045
They found his body in the woods
by school, beaten to death.

832
01:17:32,747 --> 01:17:36,148
Kaiser. Kaiser.

833
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:38,549
Come here, boy.
Come here, Kaiser.

834
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,316
Come here, boy.

835
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:45,553
Come here, boy.
Good boy.

836
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:48,255
Okay, fine. You're right.
It's not an emergency.

837
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:51,992
Could I please talk to the people
that try and solve murders?

838
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:55,127
Jesus!

839
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:58,764
Come on.
That's a good boy.

840
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,437
- Come here, Toby.
- Yeah, yeah, um...

841
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:11,007
- Come here.
- My... My name is Steven... Hello?

842
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,680
Hello? Hello?

843
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,918
- The phone is dead.
- You're next, man!

844
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:20,358
No!

845
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:23,886
You don't know what's out there.
Here. Security'll come.

846
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:31,134
- There's no siren.
- Well, they'll still get the signal. Larry'll come.

847
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,767
No, it's disconnected. The system
works through the phone lines.

848
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,812
- Come here.
- It doesn't matter. No one is getting in here.

849
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:42,441
- You designed it, remember? Reinforced doors. No entry without the code.
- Dad?

850
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,577
David's got the code.

851
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:01,396
It all could've been different,
Mr. Walker.

852
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:04,905
You should've allowed nature
to take its course.

853
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,773
In the end it will anyway.

854
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:11,573
So let me in
the fuckin' house!

855
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,656
- Nicole, take Margo and Toby up to your room and stay there.
- Okay.

856
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:29,925
Laura, get the flashlight. Then
turn off every light in the house!

857
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,533
Go, Nicole!
And lock your door!

858
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:57,418
- Turn the flashlight off. I don't want
'em to know where anybody is.

859
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:03,888
- No one's gonna hurt
our family, honey. No one!

860
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,170
An eye for an eye,
eh, Mr. Walker, sir?

861
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:54,511
You fuck up my house,
I'll fuck up yours!

862
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:56,607
Steven?

863
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:02,455
Come on.
The refrigerator.

864
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,093
Oh, they're gonna kill us,
just like they did Gary.

865
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,603
Don't say that.
You need to calm down.

866
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,870
- I can't. I can't. I can't.
- You need to.

867
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:25,936
- Nicole.
- Noo-oo-oo!

868
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,778
Get out of the way!

869
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,884
Go check the kids. Go on.

870
01:21:38,192 --> 01:21:40,126
Nicole, are you all right?

871
01:21:40,194 --> 01:21:42,253
We're okay!

872
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,161
Steve!

873
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:04,913
You gotta do ol' dad
a favor before he kills you.

874
01:22:27,675 --> 01:22:30,940
We're sorry. You've reached a number
that has been disconnected...

875
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:33,572
or is no longer in service.

876
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,528
- Steve!
- Laura!

877
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:13,047
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

878
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,154
I gotta get to a hospital, man.
I'm fucked!

879
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,820
- I'm fucked!
- This gig's tired.

880
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:22,863
Car comin', Logan.
Let's get outta here.

881
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:25,831
- Logan, you comin'?
- It's Larry.

882
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,630
- Gimme the fuckin' gun.
- It's gonna be all right.

883
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,864
Thank you, God.
Thank you.

884
01:23:30,938 --> 01:23:34,374
- Stay here.
- Be careful, Steven.

885
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,355
Hands in the air, son.

886
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:59,764
- Sir, is there somethin' wrong?
- Hands on the hood real slow.

887
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:04,703
Sir, I think there's some confusion. I
just came back from visiting my girlfriend.

888
01:24:04,772 --> 01:24:07,206
Is that right?

889
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:12,078
- Stay where you are!
- Larry!

890
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:15,673
- Mr. Walker, you okay?
- We're all right. We're safe.

891
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,981
- You know these jokers? Are there any more of them?
- I think the others ran away.

892
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:46,910
There's plenty of time. We're gonna take
this inside. Get the cuffs and the guns.

893
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:06,659
Laura, stay back!
Don't open the door.

894
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,703
- What? Steven, what's going on?
- Mrs. Walker?

895
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:13,831
Ma'am, we'd like you to see the
situation from a different point of view.

896
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:17,377
- Oh, God!
- Laura, no!

897
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:22,178
Yo, lady of the house, we're comin' in. You
gotta decide if he's comin' with us, and fast.

898
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:25,617
Say bye-bye.

899
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,293
Laura.

900
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,268
Laura, no!

901
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:55,682
I'm sorry.

902
01:25:56,984 --> 01:26:00,078
Terry, go out there
and keep a watch.

903
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:04,113
If I could get to Laura's car phone...

904
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,218
I can fit through my bathroom window.

905
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,244
Log, cuff her.

906
01:26:30,551 --> 01:26:33,281
Steven!

907
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:36,221
Logan, go find some tape.

908
01:26:57,511 --> 01:27:01,607
I think I'll go check out
the rest of the house.

909
01:27:01,682 --> 01:27:04,412
If you touch any
of those kids...

910
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:08,979
Calm down, Mr. Walker.
Everything's under control.

911
01:27:24,004 --> 01:27:27,804
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

912
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:34,278
- Let go of me!
- Noo-oo-oo!

913
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:37,749
- Leave her alone! Don't you hurt her!
- Jealous bitch!

914
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:40,184
- No! No!
- Come on!

915
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,759
- Stop!
- No, get off me! No!

916
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:50,956
Stop hitting her,
you mother...

917
01:28:04,077 --> 01:28:06,045
Toby!

918
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:31,131
Come on, Mr. Walker.

919
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:34,140
Time to give away the bride.

920
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:05,095
No! No!

921
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,878
It's time to go, Nicole.

922
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:19,943
- First, I want you to do the
right thing and say bye to Daddy.

923
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,858
- No!
- What?

924
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:31,227
You wanna go with me,
don't you?

925
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,936
- Yes.
- Well, all right then.

926
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:42,067
Come here and give your father a kiss good-bye.
It's not easy to give away your daughter.

927
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,111
David! Don't!

928
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:49,038
Please!

929
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:52,711
Nicole.

930
01:29:54,054 --> 01:29:56,215
I know this is hard.

931
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:59,555
I'm sorry it has to be
like this, but it does.

932
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:01,754
It's not our fault.

933
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:05,060
It's his.
I tried so hard to be nice,

934
01:30:05,132 --> 01:30:08,397
to get him to accept me.

935
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:12,303
Can't you see all he wants is for you
to be his little girl forever?

936
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,898
You don't want that,
do you?

937
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:23,143
It's okay.

938
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:27,051
All girls cry at their weddings.
Now, I know this is gonna be hard.

939
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:31,421
We'll get over it... together.

940
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:36,192
Just me and you.
Nobody else, remember?

941
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,268
Daddy.

942
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:47,605
You will forever hold your peace!

943
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:10,029
Now, you get out of here!

944
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:21,029
