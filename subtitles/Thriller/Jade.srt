1
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:03,560
Get the hell
out of my house!

2
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,329
Put that down.

3
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,372
What the hell's wrong with you?

4
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,708
Don't! Please!

5
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,835
No! For heaven's...

6
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,631
No. God, no! Please!

7
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:22,449
I'm gonna miss you.

8
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:37,172
I think you should canceI
your trip to LA.

9
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,548
I really do.

10
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,551
I will if you'll
canceI your triaI.

11
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:45,597
If I do, Mr. Murphy goes
to jaiI for 30 years.

12
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,224
He deserves it.

13
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:52,103
How could you defend
that son of a bitch, anyway?

14
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,064
Ever hear
of the Sixth Amendment?

15
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:57,025
He's entitled to the best
counseI he can buy...

16
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,360
I mean get.

17
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:02,239
You got it right
the first time, honey.

18
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,492
You have to
understand something.

19
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,828
Mr. Murphy doesn't see himself
as a son of a bitch.

20
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,830
He gives to charities.

21
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,833
He reads bedtime stories
to his kids.

22
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,170
You're breaking my heart, Matt.

23
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:21,132
Getting slow
in your old age, Gavin?

24
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:28,348
Thank you for inviting me.

25
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,350
It was Matt's idea.

26
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:31,893
It was?

27
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,147
He couldn't believe you never
went to a black-and-white ball.

28
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,191
I had other priorities.

29
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,943
Really?

30
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,903
Is everything Matt's idea?

31
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,490
You look beautifuI.

32
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,410
Thanks.

33
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,918
It's past your bedtime, David.

34
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,304
I love you, Trina.

35
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,598
Telephone call
for Mr. Corelli.

36
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,310
Mr. Corelli, there's a phone
call for you in the lounge.

37
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,150
Where's your phone?

38
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,367
Corelli.

39
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,785
What?

40
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,037
How?

41
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,082
OK. I'll be right there.

42
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,841
David, was it something I said?

43
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,595
Kyle Medford's dead.

44
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,513
What?!

45
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,684
Oh, my God.
I just saw him today.

46
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,102
You did?

47
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:59,397
Yes. We talked about the new
Matisse for the museum.

48
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,941
What happened?

49
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,277
He was murdered.

50
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:25,340
- It's a freak show.
- I'm not here.

51
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:28,468
- Who's in charge?
- Hargrove and Vasko.

52
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,804
- You on call?
- Yep.

53
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,265
You just hit the jackpot.

54
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,027
Hey.

55
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,489
We guess time of death
about four hours ago.

56
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,991
Want to look upstairs?

57
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:52,867
OK.

58
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,953
Get these people out.

59
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,080
They're stepping on evidence.

60
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,419
Black tie, Mr. Prosecutor?

61
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,088
Four separate cuts.
Two to the jugular.

62
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,132
Take a look
at this little goody.

63
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,427
Some kind of an African hatchet.

64
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:15,432
It's a fertility mask.
The maid says he collected them.

65
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,767
He was wearing it
when she found him.

66
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:20,937
The maid came back about eight
after seeing a movie.

67
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,647
She found him like this.

68
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,566
The weapon belongs to him.

69
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,403
It'll be tough
to show premeditation.

70
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,577
This is rage.

71
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,624
Make sure we get
some random blood samples.

72
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,501
Let's print the toilet.
Maybe he took a leak.

73
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,586
Or she.

74
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,179
Get anything in here?

75
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,349
I got some prints
off the tea set.

76
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:21,873
We'll wrap it.
It won't be a problem.

77
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,877
I'll send the ID tech guy
the prints.

78
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,629
The lab clear this room?

79
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:28,838
Yeah, they're done.

80
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:34,094
See if we can get
a hit this time.

81
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,471
Um... That bothers me.

82
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,641
See where he is with his work.

83
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,424
Karen?

84
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,676
Let's get these to the lab.

85
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,386
What are they?

86
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:19,139
Well, either he
collected pubic hair,

87
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,143
or he's auditioning
for a ClairoI ad.

88
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:08,063
We're all done.
Paramedics are finishing up.

89
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,981
- We're heading out.
- Right.

90
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,484
Don't log this untiI I say, OK?

91
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,487
- What is it?
- I'll tell you later.

92
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,988
Prints on the hatchet.

93
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,490
Perfect 14-pointers.

94
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,825
Do I get a warrant
on phone records?

95
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,077
His privacy's gone.

96
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,829
The media will make it
into a gangbang.

97
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,831
Everything goes through me.

98
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,667
You gotta be loving this shit.

99
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,918
I'm sorry?

100
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,420
Next year's an election year.

101
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,547
Good to see you.

102
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:38,426
Good to see you, too, Corelli.

103
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,222
Better bring Clifford
up to speed.

104
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:45,058
- What are you laughing at?
- I'm not.

105
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,686
Next year is an election year,
isn't it?

106
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,647
Is it? We'll talk later.

107
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,649
Yeah. See you.

108
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,612
- David, Mr. Wong.
- Mr. Wong.

109
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:41,740
Ask Mr. Wong
if he recognises this.

110
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,209
It was bought at his store.

111
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,754
It's good silver
from Chiang-Su in China.

112
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,548
Did he do the engraving?

113
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,220
No. It was done in Hong Kong.

114
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,723
For who?

115
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,856
It was made for a rich man here.

116
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:17,776
A gift from a beautifuI woman.

117
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,072
Ask him what this means.

118
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,661
It means jade.

119
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,830
Jade.

120
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,976
- Morning, HaI.
- Morning, Mr. Gavin.

121
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,852
Thank you.

122
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:54,145
Mmm...

123
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,524
See you in a couple of days.

124
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,694
OK. I'll call you.

125
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:01,903
Be good.

126
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,197
Always. You be carefuI.

127
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,199
- Morning, Mrs. Gavin.
- Morning.

128
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,034
Would you care for breakfast?

129
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,287
Er... just some coffee.

130
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,918
We're ready, Mrs. Gavin.

131
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,337
Father,
you are holy, indeed,

132
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,008
and all Creation
rightly gives you praise.

133
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,344
AII life, all holiness
comes from you,

134
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,306
through your son
Jesus Christ, our Lord,

135
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,474
by the working of
the Holy Spirit.

136
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:36,187
From age to age, you gather
people to yourself

137
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,398
so that from east to west,

138
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,652
an offering may be made
to the glory of your name.

139
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,448
And so, Father,
we bring you these gifts.

140
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:50,493
We ask you to make them holy
by the power of your spirit,

141
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,871
that they may become for us

142
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:58,209
the body and blood of your son
our Lord Jesus Christ...

143
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,920
What are you doing here?

144
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,506
I took Trina to the airport.
Free for lunch?

145
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:05,508
You see the papers?

146
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,761
It's the case you've been
dreaming about.

147
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:11,222
It will put your ambitious ass
into the big office.

148
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,851
You'll be the next DA
of San Francisco.

149
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,436
Where did she go?

150
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:20,565
- LA for a few days.
- Think she's coming back?

151
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:24,069
Maybe when we get a divorce,
you can marry her.

152
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,112
CooI.

153
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:29,074
She said you were
a terrible lover.

154
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,910
She lies
to protect your fraiI ego.

155
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,246
She said that's why
she chose me.

156
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,622
Everybody makes mistakes.

157
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,792
You finally admit that.

158
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,211
- You still playing?
- Sure.

159
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:44,923
- See you at 1:00?
- Take your best shot.

160
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,427
Medford had money problems.

161
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,639
Last year he lost $8 million
on the yen.

162
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,767
That's what he gets
for betting the yen.

163
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,815
And there's something else.
We've got a problem.

164
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:04,359
Only if we make it a problem.

165
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:08,196
We found a roll of film
in Medford's safe.

166
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:43,648
- This a gag?
- No gag.

167
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,153
Those pictures are not relevant
to this investigation.

168
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,988
Who's the girl?

169
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,199
Now, that
is a relevant question.

170
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:55,327
Let's find her.

171
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,495
We don't know anything
about her.

172
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,414
It's a waste of time.

173
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,416
We know one thing...

174
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,460
she's not a nun.

175
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:09,883
What about the, um... gentleman?

176
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,552
You want to bring him in?

177
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,930
I'm not making that call.

178
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,516
I'll take care of it, OK?

179
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,489
You've got pictures of the
governor with some hooker?

180
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,199
Keep that to yourself.

181
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,204
- What will you do?
- I'm seeing him tomorrow.

182
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,331
He could turn you
into road-kill.

183
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,582
No shit.

184
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:44,793
Why don't you come downtown?

185
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,169
As a partner?

186
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:47,796
Eventually.

187
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,090
What for?

188
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,260
Money. ReaI money.

189
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,054
I'm having fun doing what I do.

190
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,849
There's only three fun things
in life - money, sex and power.

191
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:01,935
Two out of three's not bad.

192
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:05,313
Be carefuI your dream case
don't blow your brains out.

193
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,150
What's this divorce stuff?

194
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:10,193
Oh, that.

195
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,737
I was just yanking your chain.

196
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,614
Oh?

197
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,034
You guys OK?

198
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,536
Yeah.

199
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,080
Don't look so disappointed,
David.

200
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,960
You're a cynicaI
son of a bitch, man.

201
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,087
Yeah, that's why we're friends.

202
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,062
Governor, Mr. Corelli.

203
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,859
Morning, sir.

204
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:54,404
David. Good to see you.

205
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:56,698
Always good
to see our rising stars,

206
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,743
even if they're plotting
headaches for my friends.

207
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,745
I like your boss.

208
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:06,291
Word is that you were thinking
about opposing him.

209
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,711
None of us ever run
for anything, do we?

210
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:12,589
We just allow the party faithfuI
to draft us.

211
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,674
You know my AA, Bill Barrett?

212
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,426
- Sit down.
- Thanks

213
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:20,263
I don't know how I can help
with Kyle. I liked him.

214
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:22,515
I've got a meeting
in 10 minutes.

215
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,601
I was hoping to see you alone.

216
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,811
I have no secrets from Bill.

217
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:30,106
He knows where all
the bodies are buried.

218
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:32,651
There's something
I need to show you.

219
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,111
Show me, but quickly.

220
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,382
Push the fucking meeting back
a half-hour.

221
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:56,758
Yes, sir.

222
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,469
I'd like to be alone
with David...

223
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,388
with the distinguished
Mr. Corelli.

224
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,679
Where did you get these?

225
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,556
Kyle Medford's safe.

226
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,017
Son of a bitch.

227
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:52,689
The miserable cock-sucking
son of a bitch.

228
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:00,947
Who knows about them?

229
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:03,617
The investigating officers.
My people.

230
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:10,206
And you, of course.

231
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,791
And me.

232
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,837
If you drag me into this, David,

233
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:20,383
if my name even shows up
on the periphery of this,

234
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,053
you better get the fuck
out of California

235
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:25,764
because you'll have as much
future as Jerry Brown.

236
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,810
Who's Jerry Brown?

237
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:35,232
Wouldn't it be an awfuI shame

238
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:39,444
if one little pussy
and a thimblefuI of sperm

239
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:42,239
were to affect the future
of this state?

240
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,741
Was Medford blackmailing you?

241
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:49,704
I don't get blackmailed,
Mr. Corelli.

242
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,084
I do the fucking.
I never get fucked.

243
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,545
I have my answer, then.
Thank you for your help.

244
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,340
Any time.
I enjoy dispensing advice

245
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,676
to those who care to listen.

246
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,803
Uh, the...

247
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,138
You have other copies,
I presume?

248
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,848
That's correct.

249
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,476
Then I'll just hold on to these.

250
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:15,772
Fine. Good to see you again.

251
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:22,153
Dr. Gavin
is a psychologist

252
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,364
who specialises
in the causes and treatment

253
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,658
of violence in the workplace.

254
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,662
Her work's been published in the
NationaI Review of Psychiatry

255
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,124
and in her two best-selling
works of non-fiction.

256
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:37,294
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Katrina Gavin.

257
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:46,428
Good afternoon.

258
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:50,265
Today I'll examine situations
common to your company

259
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,517
and others
in the changing workplace.

260
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,269
It's important to distinguish

261
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:58,148
between someone having a bad day
that ends in a tantrum

262
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:01,192
and someone whose failure
to resist aggressive impulses

263
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:04,487
results in serious
destructive acts.

264
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:08,992
These people are in many ways
no different from you and me,

265
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,037
but they can no longer
controI their urges.

266
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,706
They disassociate themselves
from their actions,

267
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:17,792
often experiencing
an hystericaI blindness.

268
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,837
They're blind to the darkness
within themselves.

269
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:47,030
You have reached
the law offices

270
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,199
of Gavin, Terry, and Klorinda.

271
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,035
Office hours are 9am to 6pm.

272
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:55,455
After the beep,
please leave a message.

273
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,207
Hey, it's me.

274
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:03,380
I thought maybe you were
working late, but I guess not.

275
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:06,258
I'm so tired of these things,
honey.

276
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,803
I feel like I'm disassociating
myself from my own actions.

277
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:15,100
Maybe I'm reaching
hystericaI blindness.

278
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,812
Hey, be carefuI. I might give in
to an uncontrollable urge.

279
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:22,566
Anyway...

280
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:24,359
I miss you.

281
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,240
How does that
make you feel?

282
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:32,951
Be nice.

283
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:37,497
You don't give a shit
about anyone, do you?

284
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,292
That's none of your business.

285
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,301
Governor Edwards called me.

286
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:52,762
Oh, yeah?

287
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:54,139
Yeah.

288
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,933
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

289
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:02,355
The next time you go there,
check with me first.

290
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,857
OK.

291
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,153
I want you off this case.

292
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,238
Cliff, I am onto something here.

293
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,365
I need a little more time.

294
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:15,744
I want you off the case.

295
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,709
You take me off this,
and I will go public.

296
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:25,670
I don't think the governor
would appreciate that.

297
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,469
Why don't you work it out
and try it yourself?

298
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,471
Maybe I will.

299
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:37,974
You haven't tried a case
in 10 years, Cliff.

300
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,437
Will there be anything else?

301
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,692
Here's the governor's
lady friend.

302
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,695
She's 17 here.

303
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,657
Had to get
into juvenile files for this.

304
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:55,951
Patrice Jacinto, 21.

305
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:58,578
Works for a beauty parlour
in Chinatown.

306
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,875
One arrest for solicitation
when she was a juvenile.

307
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:07,712
- You talk to her yet?
- No, not yet.

308
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,130
Her bank account shows
two $10,000 deposits

309
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:11,049
in the last six months.

310
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:54,968
Medford's had this place
a couple of years.

311
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,929
His investment company
leases it.

312
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:04,394
- Hi, John.
- Vasko.

313
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:08,064
I bet you can't wait
to see the bedroom.

314
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,191
- Corelli.
- Morning.

315
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,363
Deep-seated massage oiI.

316
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:20,327
And over here we have
a harmony pillow.

317
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:22,704
"This pillow allows
deeper penetration

318
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:26,124
"by positioning both partners
most advantageously.

319
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,419
"It raises the female hips,
facilitating male entry.

320
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:32,339
"You can inflate the pillow

321
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,342
"to varying degrees
of hardness or softness

322
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:39,387
"while enjoying the thrill
of floating action. "

323
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,558
Here in the nightstand,

324
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,144
we got about
three grams of coke...

325
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:49,147
Some poppers, some assorted
children's vitamins...

326
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:52,025
My best guess is ecstasy.

327
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:55,278
This is the room the governor
was photographed in.

328
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,198
Maybe it's his bridaI suite.

329
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,866
You look in here?

330
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:02,118
Yeah. It's been photographed.

331
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,206
Cristalle, Beluga,
Wolfgang Puck...

332
00:30:06,248 --> 00:30:09,793
- It's a fuck-house.
- Not just a fuck-house.

333
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:12,379
He's got a nice
little camera over here...

334
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,673
and there's another one
up here...

335
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:17,050
low-light, high-density.

336
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:20,262
Neighbour saw
a lot of women come here.

337
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:23,390
Did you check out these jammin'
jellies and cliterrifics?

338
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:25,183
I was thinking about you.

339
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:28,687
Honey, I'd rip off
some of those butt plugs.

340
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,897
They're designed for
the perfect asshole.

341
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,320
Inspector Vasko.

342
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:43,577
Take a look at this.

343
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,912
You think the lab can do
anything with that?

344
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:49,207
- They can try recycling it.
- Great.

345
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,836
What about this neighbour?

346
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:56,172
Name's Guy Henderson. Claims
he never saw Medford here,

347
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:58,133
but saw women at the house.

348
00:30:58,174 --> 00:30:59,551
Can he identify anybody?

349
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,970
I think he saw more
than he says.

350
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:05,223
His bedroom faces the house
and he's got a scope.

351
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:08,435
I didn't spy on them
or anything.

352
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,937
I'm sure you didn't,
Mr. Henderson.

353
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:13,648
A lot of women came up.
Men, too.

354
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,818
How many different women
you see over there?

355
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,696
I don't know.
Five or six, maybe.

356
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:23,491
Did you ever see any
of these women over there?

357
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:30,457
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

358
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:31,750
I think I saw her.

359
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:34,878
Patrice Jacinto.

360
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,673
She's been working in this
beauty parlour for six months.

361
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:42,177
Fifteen jobs in two years.
Waitress, actress...

362
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:46,056
You wonder how she put so much
dough in her account.

363
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:52,145
Ms. Jacinto?

364
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:53,355
Yes?

365
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:54,481
Could we talk to you?

366
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,483
Yeah. Just a second.

367
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,319
Ah, shit!

368
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,533
Patrice!

369
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,050
Watch it!

370
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,381
Watch out!

371
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,114
Patrice! Stop!

372
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:27,991
Patrice! God damn it!

373
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,160
God damn it, hold still!

374
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,746
God damn it!

375
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,415
Here. Here.

376
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,918
Shut up, sweetheart.
You're going downtown.

377
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,755
- Fuck!
- Come on, damn it!

378
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:04,903
My name is David Corelli.

379
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:07,906
I'm the assistant DA
in charge of homicide here.

380
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:09,074
Congratulations.

381
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,367
Thank you.

382
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,870
Something to drink or smoke?

383
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:16,790
No. They said I couldn't
smoke in here.

384
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:18,500
They were wrong.

385
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:25,924
Let me tell you how this works.

386
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:29,553
I know, damn it!
I'm fucking calling my lawyer!

387
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,347
I can't believe
you did this shit!

388
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,016
Look at this!
Look at my face!

389
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,686
Sit down, Patrice.

390
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:40,188
Now, sit down.

391
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:51,825
You're right. Call your attorney
and say I have a witness

392
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:56,037
who'll identify you visiting
Kyle Medford's Pacifica house.

393
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,167
Sound familiar? I have pictures
of you fucking the governor

394
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:05,088
and those pictures will ruin
the governor's career.

395
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,133
And you know what's going to
happen then, Patrice?

396
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:13,597
Your attorney will tell you
to go fuck yourself and hang up.

397
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:25,942
The pay phone is
right out there in the hall.

398
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,530
Wait a minute.

399
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:37,621
Wait a minute.

400
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:42,626
I met Kyle at a party
and he knew I was broke,

401
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:46,212
so he offered me 500 a pop.

402
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:50,133
I mean, I fuck guys for less.

403
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:52,177
I'd go to the Pacifica house,

404
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,138
a guy would come
and we'd spend the night.

405
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,183
They wouldn't know me.
I didn't know them.

406
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,686
A couple of creeps
didn't even want me.

407
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:04,481
They wanted this other girl
they'd fucked before.

408
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:05,982
They called her Jade.

409
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,655
One of those guys
was the governor.

410
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:14,491
Jade must have rocked his world,

411
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:18,328
because he wanted me to
bend over and turn around,

412
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,248
but I don't take it that way.

413
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,875
He told me that Jade
took it any way.

414
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,670
She couldn't get enough.
She loved it.

415
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:30,757
I saw her once
leaving Kyle's house.

416
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:37,681
She had long, beautifuI hair
and great legs.

417
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:39,891
I think it was her.

418
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:43,770
I never met her.
I'd like to, though.

419
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:45,814
I'm into women, mostly.

420
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:26,706
Uhh!

421
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:35,548
Somebody sawed
through your brake line.

422
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,468
There was no fluid
in your wheeI cylinders.

423
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,136
His blood count's low.

424
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:42,931
He's lost consciousness,
could have a concussion.

425
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:45,058
We'll have to run some tests.

426
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:49,980
Somebody up there
loves you, Corelli.

427
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:57,195
They want to subpoena
my records.

428
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,281
They talked to my CEO.

429
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:02,909
He's pleading to two felony
counts and telling everything.

430
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:06,663
- What does he know?
- Everything.

431
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:12,586
You know Vince. He's my closest
friend - 20 years.

432
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:13,920
Who's representing him?

433
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:14,963
Lawton.

434
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,173
- Harry Lawton?
- Yeah.

435
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,468
Has he signed a plea agreement?

436
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,887
I don't know.

437
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,889
I know Harry.

438
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,599
Don't worry about it.

439
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,559
What do you mean?

440
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,060
He's a bullshit artist.

441
00:39:29,102 --> 00:39:32,522
If it wasn't for me,
he would have been disbarred.

442
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,858
What am I going to do, Matt?

443
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,985
I've got four kids.

444
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:42,574
- A triaI will kill Sara.
- You will not go to triaI.

445
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:45,493
You will not do one day in jaiI.

446
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:47,120
You have my word.

447
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:48,747
Listen to me.

448
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:51,541
When they find out
I'm representing you,

449
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,169
this will all go away -
everything, OK?

450
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:57,964
We got prints on the hatchet.

451
00:39:58,006 --> 00:39:59,007
Patrice?

452
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,592
No, but we got lucky.

453
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:02,677
An arrest in Palo Alto in 1980.

454
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,888
Some animaI rights protest
at Stanford.

455
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,223
No charges ever filed,

456
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:08,183
but the Sacramento computer
held prints.

457
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,645
Anna Katrina Maxwell.

458
00:40:11,686 --> 00:40:15,523
We're trying to locate her
through the admissions office.

459
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:19,194
- You OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

460
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:21,112
Nice work.

461
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,592
I appreciate you doing this,
Mr. Henderson.

462
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:46,137
I want to show you
one more set of pictures.

463
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,352
OK. Anybody look familiar?

464
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:54,271
None of these are familiar.

465
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:56,273
Nobody from that set. OK.

466
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:01,403
One more group.
One, two... One more.

467
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:06,908
Yeah. I've seen her.

468
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,203
- The one in the middle?
- Yeah.

469
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,080
OK.

470
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:15,709
Paisan, get in here.

471
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,835
It's about time.

472
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:19,629
Tell Judge Licaldi
I'll ring him later.

473
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:21,214
Come on.

474
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:26,219
She told you
she saw Medford that day.

475
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,388
They were looking at a Matisse.

476
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,182
Matt, her prints
are on the hatchet.

477
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:33,643
I got to start at the beginning.

478
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:37,188
She probably looked at his
collection while she was there.

479
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,481
What are you saying?

480
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:41,359
To eliminate her,
I need to speak to her.

481
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,904
Fine. She'll be back
from LA tomorrow.

482
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:47,115
- Talk to her.
- Officially.

483
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:51,870
Come on, David... You know her.

484
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:56,207
You know her as well as I do.
You loved her.

485
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,751
- Still do.
- Cheap shot.

486
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:01,129
You think she'd take
a fucking hatchet to somebody?

487
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:04,799
No, I don't, which is why
I need to talk to her.

488
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:08,845
Fine. Come to the house,
have lunch, then talk to her.

489
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:56,393
Yes? Can I help you?

490
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:58,687
Inspector Vasko,
San Francisco Police Department.

491
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:02,566
- In the living room, please.
- Thank you.

492
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:06,486
- Hi, Maria.
- Mr. Corelli. Nice to see you.

493
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:18,164
Cosy little pad.

494
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:21,167
Yeah. Kind of like
Candlestick Park.

495
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:28,758
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Hello.

496
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,802
- Inspector Vasko.
- Trina Gavin.

497
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:34,306
- Hi, Bob Hargrove.
- Hi.

498
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,143
- Matt said you had an accident.
- I'm fine.

499
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:39,519
Let's get something straight.

500
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:44,232
Mrs. Gavin is only talking to you
because she is not a suspect.

501
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:48,111
The investigation does not focus
on her at this time.

502
00:43:48,153 --> 00:43:50,739
I think we can live with that.

503
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,783
What's your
relationship with Kyle Medford?

504
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:57,787
I'm on the board of the Pacific
Museum. Kyle was chairman.

505
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:02,417
He felt we were too conservative
in our acquisitions program.

506
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,211
I supported his efforts
to be more active.

507
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,130
Did you see him socially?

508
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,798
No, not really.

509
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,885
My husband and I saw him
at various functions.

510
00:44:11,927 --> 00:44:14,012
Did you ever meet alone?

511
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:18,642
Yes. One time. The day he died.

512
00:44:18,683 --> 00:44:24,856
He called me to talk about
acquiring a new Matisse.

513
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:31,279
I was leaving town, so I agreed
to meet him at his house.

514
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,822
That was last Saturday?

515
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,449
Yes.

516
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:37,118
What time did you get there?

517
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,329
I got there around 4:00.

518
00:44:39,371 --> 00:44:41,331
We talked about the Matisse.

519
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:44,167
He gave me some tea.

520
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:46,336
He showed me his collection.

521
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:47,837
Was he alone?

522
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:49,339
Yes.

523
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,508
Did anyone see you there?

524
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,635
No. I don't think so.

525
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:57,764
What sort of things
did he show you?

526
00:44:57,806 --> 00:45:01,935
He showed me this God-awfuI mask
from the Cameroon -

527
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:07,232
I think it was a fertility mask
- and a hatchet.

528
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:10,151
He said it was
over 100 years old.

529
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:12,070
Did you touch anything?

530
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:15,073
I touched the hatchet.

531
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:18,368
The mask, he held it up.

532
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,039
I can't remember
whether I touched it or not.

533
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:25,625
What did you do
after you left?

534
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,377
I went home.

535
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:28,878
Was your husband here?

536
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:32,799
- No.
- Was anyone here? Staff?

537
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:35,135
- No.
- Did you use the phone?

538
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:39,097
I had the machine on.
I was preparing a speech.

539
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:43,351
Look, I have no alibi
untiI 9:00,

540
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:45,896
when we went to the ball.

541
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:50,191
- Is that what you're asking?
- What else do you need?

542
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:53,278
Have you ever been
to Medford's beach house?

543
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:59,117
Only his house in the city.
I didn't know he had another.

544
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,912
Ever give Medford
a silver jewellery box?

545
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,705
I never gave any gift.

546
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:06,041
You never had sex with him?

547
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:07,709
What kind of question is that?

548
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:08,960
That's why they're here.

549
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:11,755
You don't have to answer that.

550
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:18,929
I said I had no sociaI contact
with him.

551
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,141
I do consider sex
to be a sociaI contact, David.

552
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:25,477
As you know, I'm married.

553
00:46:27,395 --> 00:46:28,730
I think she did it.

554
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,190
Why?

555
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:32,317
No alibi. Prints on the hatchet.

556
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,694
- And she lied.
- TypicaI shrink.

557
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:36,613
They pull your strings.

558
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:39,783
She was pulling your strings
pretty good.

559
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:06,596
The guy almost
had them convinced...

560
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:08,557
Morning, Corelli.

561
00:49:08,598 --> 00:49:11,601
Hey, Dave, how you doing?

562
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:14,354
Got something to show you.

563
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:16,856
How we doing?

564
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:20,735
Now this... is what you gave us.

565
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:24,489
We were able to enhance it
using software algorithms.

566
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:27,492
Let's see...

567
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:31,871
This is how it looked
when we got it.

568
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:34,457
Medford's beach house.

569
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:41,047
At least it's not
the governor again.

570
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:42,883
Or the president.

571
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:44,926
Thank God.

572
00:49:44,968 --> 00:49:47,429
I can still believe in hope.

573
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:51,016
There's some jump cuts,
but we saved a few minutes.

574
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,440
You ever take it
like that, Corelli?

575
00:49:58,481 --> 00:50:00,525
Is that an offer, Inspector?

576
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,027
You wish.

577
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:05,739
We cleaned it up
a lot more from here on.

578
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,991
Right.
Keep working on this,

579
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:10,118
you'll have a PG rating.

580
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:15,081
Boy, it's a wonderfuI
country, isn't it?

581
00:50:20,837 --> 00:50:22,839
Freeze it right there.

582
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:26,426
Magnify it.

583
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:34,893
Jesus.

584
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:10,679
David?

585
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,972
Got a minute?

586
00:51:12,013 --> 00:51:13,014
Yeah.

587
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:16,935
Miss Jacinto called. She wants
to meet you at 5:00 today.

588
00:51:16,977 --> 00:51:19,229
Tell her Fior d'Italia,
Washington Square.

589
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:21,648
OK. She said it's about Jade.

590
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,485
Hey, you asshole!

591
00:53:37,993 --> 00:53:40,078
Get away from her!

592
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,708
Call an ambulance.
Call 911. Code three. Do it!

593
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:56,029
Hey, you asshole!

594
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:34,776
Fuck! Fuck!

595
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:10,695
Shit!

596
01:01:36,221 --> 01:01:40,058
Man, you fucked up!

597
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,316
MedicaI examiner's
case number 3209.

598
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:50,902
March 16, 1995.

599
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:53,238
Patrice Jacinto.

600
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,782
There are abrasions
to the chin.

601
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:57,701
The abrasions
are minimally haemorrhagic

602
01:01:57,742 --> 01:02:00,495
and red to purple in colour.

603
01:02:00,537 --> 01:02:05,000
The neck wound is
of a "Y" configuration -

604
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:09,296
the horizontaI line
being five inches long

605
01:02:09,337 --> 01:02:11,172
and half an inch in width.

606
01:02:11,214 --> 01:02:14,009
We don't have
a talking head any more.

607
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,761
Somebody knew
she was talking to us.

608
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:19,222
I didn't know
you knew the governor.

609
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:21,975
I don't.
I know Bill Barrett. Why?

610
01:02:22,017 --> 01:02:25,729
- Want me to introduce you?
- Go fuck yourself.

611
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:30,191
- Glad you made her talk?
- What did you say?

612
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:31,818
You heard it.

613
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,528
What?

614
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:38,116
I am onto you! I am onto you!

615
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,952
Get off me, Petey!

616
01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:43,330
I am onto you.

617
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,251
You want to tell me about that?

618
01:02:49,336 --> 01:02:51,171
I can't yet.

619
01:02:52,923 --> 01:02:54,633
What is it?

620
01:02:55,717 --> 01:03:00,013
- It's a cuff link.
- Don't play with me.

621
01:03:00,055 --> 01:03:02,474
I want to know what it means.

622
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:04,184
I don't know.

623
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:09,564
What if this comes
up in triaI, David?

624
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:11,191
There'll be questions asked...

625
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:14,653
I would never put
you up for grabs.

626
01:03:16,071 --> 01:03:18,990
You are taking
a huge chance here.

627
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:22,911
- So are you.
- Yeah. No shit.

628
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:27,249
There was something between
you and Mrs. Gavin...

629
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,000
A long time ago.

630
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,127
And you're OK with that now?

631
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:35,549
I hope so.

632
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:41,471
People who commit these acts are
no different from you and me,

633
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:44,349
but they can no longer
controI their urges.

634
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,851
They disassociate themselves
from their actions,

635
01:03:46,893 --> 01:03:50,772
often experiencing
an hystericaI blindness.

636
01:03:50,814 --> 01:03:53,316
They're blind to
the darkness within themselves.

637
01:03:55,151 --> 01:04:00,323
This is from a speech she made
in LA just a week ago.

638
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:02,701
We have her prints
on the hatchet.

639
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:05,704
We have her Iying to us
in her statement.

640
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:10,041
She was in Medford's house
just before he was killed.

641
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:14,296
- She's got no alibi.
- We don't have a motive.

642
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:15,797
What about blackmaiI?

643
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,217
The murder weapon wasn't hers.
No premeditation.

644
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:22,929
Matt Gavin's wife -
he'll eat us for breakfast.

645
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:26,224
It was her. She did it.

646
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:30,145
What make of car killed Patrice?

647
01:04:30,186 --> 01:04:32,397
Black Thunderbird.

648
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:34,608
You didn't ID the plates?

649
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:36,067
No. No plates.

650
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:37,903
What does Mrs. Gavin drive?

651
01:04:39,195 --> 01:04:42,782
Uh, they've got three cars.
A Jag, a Range Rover...

652
01:04:42,824 --> 01:04:45,660
And a black Thunderbird, right?

653
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,126
All right, bring her in.

654
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:17,442
Just who I wanted to see.

655
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:20,362
Those photographs
you left in Sacramento,

656
01:05:20,403 --> 01:05:23,490
I thought maybe now
that you won't need them,

657
01:05:23,531 --> 01:05:26,117
you could help me
find the negatives.

658
01:05:27,202 --> 01:05:29,788
Why don't you help him, Pat?

659
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:32,749
- Yeah, right.
- Excuse me.

660
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:37,212
Are you putting me on?
What do you need them for?

661
01:05:37,254 --> 01:05:39,881
They're not relevant any more.

662
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:42,008
Beat it.

663
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:49,015
Aren't you going
to read me my rights?

664
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:51,351
You can leave any time.

665
01:05:51,393 --> 01:05:55,272
I've told you about Kyle.
What else is there?

666
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:57,691
This is about Jade.

667
01:06:07,617 --> 01:06:10,996
A couple of creeps
didn't even want me.

668
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:13,415
They wanted this girl
they'd fucked before.

669
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:15,667
They called her Jade.

670
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,587
One of those guys
was the governor.

671
01:06:18,628 --> 01:06:21,131
Jade must have rocked
his world.

672
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:24,342
He wanted me to bend over
and turn around,

673
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,678
but I don't take it that way.

674
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,891
He said Jade took it any way.
She couldn't get enough of it. '

675
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:33,643
What does this have
to do with Katrina?

676
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,938
Could I have
that other tape, please?

677
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:37,742
Mrs. Gavin,
is that you?

678
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:39,452
That's not her!

679
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:43,998
- Mrs. Gavin?
- You don't have to answer.

680
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,501
I'm sorry, Matt.

681
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,420
Fuck you, David!

682
01:07:52,673 --> 01:07:53,758
All right,

683
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:56,177
let's get on with it.

684
01:07:59,263 --> 01:08:02,391
I met Jim at the museum.

685
01:08:04,685 --> 01:08:08,147
I'd never cheated
on my husband before.

686
01:08:08,189 --> 01:08:13,277
He took me to a house.
I spent the night with him.

687
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:15,154
Where?

688
01:08:15,196 --> 01:08:17,531
Pacifica.
Some place on the beach.

689
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:19,825
Did you have sex with other men?

690
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:20,910
No.

691
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:26,749
I cheated on my husband.
I didn't know I'd be arrested.

692
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:28,292
You're not under arrest.

693
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:32,213
You never called yourself Jade
or used Medford's house?

694
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:34,673
Look, bring that girl in here.

695
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:36,884
She'll tell you
I'm not that person.

696
01:08:36,926 --> 01:08:38,636
The girl is dead.

697
01:08:44,225 --> 01:08:45,726
Excuse me.

698
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:50,856
Would it surprise you to know

699
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:53,609
that Medford owned
the Pacifica house?

700
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:54,735
Yes, it would.

701
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,989
What if a witness
saw you severaI times?

702
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,283
I'd say your witness
was mistaken.

703
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:02,493
Would you?

704
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:06,247
Where were you yesterday
between five and six pm?

705
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:10,334
In the city. I met Matt
for a drink around 5:00.

706
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:12,545
Then I went to my office.

707
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:17,174
I returned a few calls
and I got home around 7:45.

708
01:09:17,216 --> 01:09:20,052
- What about Medford?
- What were you driving?

709
01:09:20,094 --> 01:09:23,472
- I asked a question.
- I'll do the questions.

710
01:09:23,514 --> 01:09:25,307
- What were you driving?
- My car.

711
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:30,146
- Black Thunderbird?
- Yes. Anything else?

712
01:09:30,187 --> 01:09:32,898
Can you be
in a line-up tomorrow?

713
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,108
That's enough!

714
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,777
If you're charging her,
do it right now!

715
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:53,419
Well, I think she had
an uncontrollable urge,

716
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:56,297
coupled with
hystericaI blindness.

717
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:06,223
It's time you took yourself
out of this.

718
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:15,775
I don't
understand something.

719
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:18,819
How could you do this to me?

720
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,405
How could I do this to you?

721
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:24,241
- What did you expect?
- Expect?

722
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:26,619
I didn't expect to go downtown

723
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:31,332
and sit and watch a tape
of my wife fucking somebody!

724
01:10:31,373 --> 01:10:34,460
You think I don't know
about you?

725
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:35,669
Know what?

726
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:37,046
I know everything.

727
01:10:37,088 --> 01:10:38,964
I know their names.

728
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:43,302
I know about the Fairmont
Towers, sometimes your office.

729
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,472
I'm not stupid, Matt.

730
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,687
Is that why you did it?

731
01:11:05,116 --> 01:11:08,536
We'll check if that's blood
on the tyres.

732
01:11:08,577 --> 01:11:10,621
You'll get a comparison
with Patrice's?

733
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:11,705
Yeah, right.

734
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,959
What about this?
This looks like blood.

735
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,711
Could be paint transfer
from an impact.

736
01:11:17,753 --> 01:11:19,755
This is the car, Petey.

737
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,925
This car was reported stolen
about a week ago.

738
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:25,678
Belongs to some
computer company executive.

739
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:28,347
Not Mrs. Gavin's car.

740
01:11:28,389 --> 01:11:30,975
Maybe somebody wants us
to think it was.

741
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,439
This is the car, Petey.

742
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,482
This is the car.

743
01:13:36,183 --> 01:13:39,770
What, did the tape
turn you on?

744
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:51,615
Don't ever talk
to me like that again!

745
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:53,743
Do you understand me?

746
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:33,532
What are you doing here?

747
01:14:33,574 --> 01:14:35,785
I need to talk to you.

748
01:14:35,826 --> 01:14:37,661
I can't. You know that.

749
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:40,081
I need your help, David.
I'm afraid.

750
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:41,791
Afraid of what?

751
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,002
Who am I speaking to?

752
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:50,132
Can I come in?

753
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,261
Come on in.

754
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,730
I didn't know Kyle
was taping any of it.

755
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:09,902
I knew they were powerfuI, but
I had no idea he was using them.

756
01:15:09,944 --> 01:15:13,280
He told me they were
friends of his.

757
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:15,408
How many were there?

758
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:20,538
A lot. I don't know.
I lost track.

759
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:23,165
How could you let them do that?

760
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,000
They didn't do anything.

761
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:27,253
It was my choice. I liked it.

762
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:30,381
- And Matt?
- I don't fuck him that way.

763
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:34,176
That's not what I mean.
What did you tell him?

764
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:37,096
Nothing.

765
01:15:37,138 --> 01:15:40,975
He only knows
about the man on the tape.

766
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:51,652
Who were the others?

767
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:53,904
Men with money...

768
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:55,281
reputations.

769
01:15:56,615 --> 01:16:00,536
I didn't have to fall in love
with them, David.

770
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,914
It was safe.

771
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:06,041
At least, I thought it was.

772
01:16:08,627 --> 01:16:11,464
David, I know too much.

773
01:16:13,215 --> 01:16:15,801
One of them killed Kyle
and Patrice.

774
01:16:15,843 --> 01:16:18,637
- I could be next.
- You should go.

775
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:22,641
I know too much!
I know you love me.

776
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,853
Don't do this. Don't do this.

777
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:19,698
Nothing's changed.

778
01:17:20,783 --> 01:17:22,701
Everything's changed.

779
01:17:22,743 --> 01:17:24,453
What?

780
01:17:24,495 --> 01:17:26,372
You killed Medford.

781
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,423
Where are you going?

782
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:03,200
San Francisco DA.

783
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:04,452
All right.

784
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:10,875
No.

785
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:14,295
There's our last link to Jade.

786
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:15,963
Anyone who's ever
seen her is dead

787
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:18,299
or suffering
from penile amnesia.

788
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,134
Jade doesn't exist any more.

789
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:23,012
CarefuI. You nearly stood
on the murder weapon.

790
01:18:23,053 --> 01:18:25,473
He was obviously
killed with that.

791
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:28,058
There doesn't appear
to be forced entry.

792
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,896
His brother came for dinner,
found the body...

793
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:34,023
The brother has a key.

794
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:36,400
He's still warm.

795
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:38,444
He's only been dead an hour.

796
01:18:38,486 --> 01:18:40,404
- How long?
- An hour.

797
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:44,075
- Where's the phone?
- It's right up there.

798
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:47,078
Your friend Trina
sure gets around.

799
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:48,871
She couldn't have done this.

800
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:52,500
- Why not?
- She was with me.

801
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,960
Maria! Maria, it's Mr. Corelli.

802
01:18:55,002 --> 01:18:57,755
Yes. Is Mrs. Gavin home?

803
01:18:57,797 --> 01:19:01,383
No. OK. How about Mr. Gavin?

804
01:19:01,425 --> 01:19:06,806
OK, would you tell Mr. Gavin
that I will be at my apartment?

805
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:08,474
Right. Thanks. Maria.

806
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:10,601
Where are you going?

807
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:27,410
<i>A clouded dream
on an earthly night</i>

808
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:32,123
<i>Hangs upon the crescent moon</i>

809
01:19:32,164 --> 01:19:36,293
<i>A voiceless song
in an ageless light</i>

810
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:40,756
<i>Sings at the coming dawn</i>

811
01:19:40,798 --> 01:19:45,177
<i>Birds in flight
are calling there</i>

812
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:49,348
<i>Where the clouds
move the storms</i>

813
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:53,853
<i>It's there that
my heart is longing for</i>

814
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:58,482
<i>All for the love of you...</i>

815
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:14,239
Stop! Stop!

816
01:20:16,867 --> 01:20:18,535
Stop!

817
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:34,509
<i>So it's there
my homage's due</i>

818
01:20:34,551 --> 01:20:38,972
<i>Clutched by
the still of the night</i>

819
01:20:39,014 --> 01:20:43,184
<i>Now I feel, feel you move</i>

820
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:47,606
<i>And every breath,
breath is full</i>

821
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:51,610
<i>So it's there
my homage's due</i>

822
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,721
Hello? Hello? Hell...

823
01:21:21,556 --> 01:21:23,558
You fucked her, didn't you?

824
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,185
Matt, where is she?

825
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:28,146
- Huh?
- Matt, she's in trouble.

826
01:23:05,577 --> 01:23:07,579
Maria?

827
01:23:12,751 --> 01:23:15,045
Maria, are you in your room?

828
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:27,098
Anybody here?

829
01:23:44,115 --> 01:23:45,617
Matt?

830
01:23:56,628 --> 01:23:58,088
Matt?

831
01:23:58,129 --> 01:24:00,006
Uh!

832
01:24:00,048 --> 01:24:01,383
Oh!

833
01:25:31,056 --> 01:25:34,643
This is Katrina Gavin,
1100 Hillsborough.

834
01:25:35,727 --> 01:25:37,187
No. Hillsborough.

835
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:39,731
Talking to one
of your boyfriends?

836
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:45,403
David, watch it!

837
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,705
Trina.

838
01:25:55,747 --> 01:25:59,709
Trina!

839
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:09,761
You like it like this,
don't you?

840
01:26:11,346 --> 01:26:13,265
Let her go!

841
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:50,635
Who's there?

842
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,636
It's a tragedy for justice when
law enforcement people go bad.

843
01:27:32,677 --> 01:27:35,764
They were cleaning up your shit.

844
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:41,144
They were just
two loyaI supporters...

845
01:27:42,187 --> 01:27:45,065
Two supporters
who got carried away.

846
01:27:45,106 --> 01:27:49,694
They wanted to see if she had
more pictures of the governor.

847
01:27:49,736 --> 01:27:52,781
They acted on their own
out of misguided loyalty.

848
01:27:52,822 --> 01:27:57,202
Kyle Medford was shaking
you down and was killed for it.

849
01:27:57,244 --> 01:27:59,829
Patrice was in those pictures.
She was next,

850
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:01,998
then Henderson,
who could ID everybody.

851
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,125
That left Trina Gavin.

852
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:06,545
Why are you wasting
the governor's time?

853
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:09,256
Anything happens to Trina Gavin,

854
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:12,259
I have film
of you and a dead hooker.

855
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:21,393
And what if something
happens to you?

856
01:28:26,898 --> 01:28:29,442
Leave her alone.

857
01:28:34,406 --> 01:28:38,159
Get the fuck out of here.

858
01:29:40,764 --> 01:29:42,182
Ready, darling?

859
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:44,184
We're going to be late.

860
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:48,563
Where did you get these?

861
01:29:48,605 --> 01:29:52,108
Kyle Medford showed me
the day before I killed him.

862
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:55,362
You knew, and you killed him?

863
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:57,155
He was a scumbag.

864
01:29:57,197 --> 01:30:00,116
He would have taken us
both down.

865
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:03,662
I told you...

866
01:30:03,703 --> 01:30:06,623
I will never let
anyone hurt you.

867
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:12,671
But I don't remember any of it.

868
01:30:12,712 --> 01:30:15,173
You know what I think it is?

869
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,717
HystericaI blindness.

870
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:24,182
Do me a favour, Trina.

871
01:30:24,224 --> 01:30:27,602
Next time we make love,

872
01:30:27,644 --> 01:30:31,022
you introduce me to Jade.

873
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:02,721
<i>A clouded dream
on an earthly night</i>

874
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:06,933
<i>Hangs upon the crescent moon</i>

875
01:31:06,975 --> 01:31:11,354
<i>A voiceless song
in an ageless light</i>

876
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:15,692
<i>Sings at the coming dawn</i>

877
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:19,905
<i>Birds in flight
are calling there</i>

878
01:31:19,946 --> 01:31:24,367
<i>Where the heart
moves the stones</i>

879
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:28,705
<i>It's there that my heart
is longing for</i>

880
01:31:28,747 --> 01:31:33,585
<i>All for the love of you</i>

881
01:31:50,352 --> 01:31:54,522
<i>A painting hangs
on an ivy wall</i>

882
01:31:54,564 --> 01:31:58,944
<i>Nestled in the emerald moss</i>

883
01:31:58,985 --> 01:32:03,198
<i>Eyes declare a truce of trust</i>

884
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:07,452
<i>Then it draws me far away</i>

885
01:32:07,494 --> 01:32:11,790
<i>Where deep
in the desert twilight</i>

886
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:16,169
<i>Sand melts in pools of the sky</i>

887
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:20,340
<i>Darkness lays
her crimson cloak</i>

888
01:32:20,382 --> 01:32:25,345
<i>Your lamps will call,
call me home</i>

889
01:32:29,307 --> 01:32:33,436
<i>So it's there my homage's due</i>

890
01:32:33,478 --> 01:32:37,732
<i>Clutched by
the still of the night</i>

891
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:42,112
<i>Now I feel, feel you move</i>

892
01:32:42,153 --> 01:32:46,491
<i>And every breath,
breath is full</i>

893
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:50,745
<i>So it's there my homage's due</i>

894
01:32:50,787 --> 01:32:55,125
<i>Clutched by
the still of the night</i>

895
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:59,421
<i>Even the distance
feels so near</i>

896
01:32:59,462 --> 01:33:04,843
<i>All for, for the love of you</i>

897
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:25,405
<i>A clouded dream
on an earthly night</i>

898
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:29,618
