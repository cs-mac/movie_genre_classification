1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,029
September third...

2
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,899
I can't believe
it's finally over,

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,819
the summer vacation
every girl dreams of...

4
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,400
sure... 17 national parks
in 28 days...

5
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,600
and all in the company
of her dad.

6
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:52,609
It's like being trapped
in a "father knows best" rerun,

7
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,949
except for this father
doesn't know anything.

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,869
<i>I wish he'd get it
through his head</i>

9
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,619
that tomorrow I turn 14, not 12.

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,169
Madeline's parents
took her to europe

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,070
and let her go to discos
every night.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,600
My dad's idea of independence

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,399
is letting me
roast my own marshmallows,

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,860
which is a good idea
since he always burns his.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,950
Anyway,
it'll all be over tonight...

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,289
tomorrow I'll be back with mom,

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,209
celebrating my birthday
and staying in my own room...

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,300
no more sleeping in bags,
thank God.

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,299
What's the problem?

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,049
Just...

21
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,220
there's gotta be

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,559
another gas station
around here somewhere.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,929
Let's see, it's 36 Miles
to the next exit,

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,400
that's not gonna be any good.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,349
What's this?

26
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,269
Banco.

27
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,550
10 or 12 Miles down there.

28
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
Open the door!

29
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,940
Hello!

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,740
Anybody here?

31
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,620
Hello?

32
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,840
Hello?

33
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Hello?

34
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,719
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

35
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,470
Whoa!

36
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,650
Who are you with, man?!

37
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,979
Nobody, I just want some gas!

38
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,729
This is a gas station, isn't it?

39
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,060
Yeah, but I ain't got no gas.

40
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,789
I've got cash.

41
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,130
Hah! I don't care if you
got gold hub caps...

42
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:46,039
I said I ain't got
no gas, you dig?

43
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,370
The delivery's overdue...
Maybe tomorrow.

44
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,390
Where you headed, man?

45
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,150
Home, to Los Angeles.

46
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,649
Oh yeah?
Far out.

47
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,189
I did some time there.

48
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,100
That is, before
I got some intelligence.

49
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,580
Is she with you?

50
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,329
Yeah.

51
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,669
Look, can I use the phone?

52
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,589
I ain't got one,
try the mini-mart.

53
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,509
Will my car be all right?

54
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,420
Yeah, if I keep an
eye on it for you.

55
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,599
How much?

56
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,349
You see, that's it, man,

57
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,105
that's wrong with this world,

58
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,260
everything's about money.

59
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,610
I'll watch your car
for you for nothing.

60
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,350
All right, thank you.

61
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,700
Get ahold of yourself.

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,369
You say they took no money
out of the register?

63
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,119
You sure?

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,620
Are you all right, ma'am?

65
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,550
Now don't touch nothin',
there may be prints.

66
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,129
You lookin' for somethin'?

67
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,550
Yeah, I wanted to use the phone.

68
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,259
Is there some problem?

69
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,100
You got some I.D.?

70
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,189
My name is Charlie Cox, sheriff,

71
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,110
<i>highways magazine, Los Angeles.</i>

72
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,279
You're off your beat
a little, aren't you?

73
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,620
Please, we've just
run out of gas.

74
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,589
Try the trailer park
down the road...

75
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,830
Agnes Reed might sell you some.

76
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,089
She sells everything else.

77
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,009
She's got a phone there, anyway.

78
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,189
What happened?

79
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,190
Somebody came in here
and blew his brains out,

80
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,529
that's what happened...

81
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,960
most likely a drifter.

82
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,150
It happens out here, Charlie.

83
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,180
Hello?

84
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,769
Hello!

85
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,739
Who's there?

86
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,160
Hi, we'd like to
buy some gas, please.

87
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,629
I ain't got any.

88
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,369
Well, how about using a phone?

89
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,530
You got any money?

90
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,210
Yes, I've got money.

91
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,290
Can't be too careful.

92
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,969
Two dollar phone charge.

93
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,300
It's okay, I'm calling collect.

94
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,190
Two dollar phone charge.

95
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,499
Can I have a soda?

96
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,249
How much for two sodas?

97
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,920
A buck each.

98
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,840
Surprise, surprise.

99
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,929
Got any ice?

100
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,090
Another buck.

101
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,849
Is that per cube?

102
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,180
Ice is out there.

103
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,340
Hi, bill, how are you?

104
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,099
Good, good.

105
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,010
Listen, I'm not going to
get your article in tonight.

106
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,640
Hot out here...

107
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,160
is it always this hot?

108
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,820
Um-mmm.

109
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,580
Somewhere in Nevada.

110
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,180
No, it's really too much
to read over the phone.

111
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,220
Give me a break,

112
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,590
the troll that runs this place
is charging me by the second.

113
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,160
Joleen?

114
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,780
Joleen?

115
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,529
What's goin' on?

116
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,860
Nothin'.

117
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,200
Then get out of here!

118
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,629
Charming kid.
One of the neighbors?

119
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,730
Nah, he's mine.

120
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,859
Always threatening
to run away... never does.

121
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,159
Look, I have to get back to L.A.
by tonight.

122
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,329
Ain't gonna happen unless
your car runs on dirt.

123
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,149
I got a couple others
stranded here too.

124
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,315
I fixed 'em up real nice.

125
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:35,650
Camper, full view
of the pool, kitchen.

126
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,570
I got one more left.

127
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,239
How much?

128
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,570
For you? Fifty bucks.

129
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,090
Fifty bucks?
Out of the question.

130
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,950
<i>Fifty bucks for this?</i>

131
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,919
Come on, it's not that bad.

132
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,639
Just for a night.

133
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,729
This is how real writers live.

134
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,510
In overpriced campers?

135
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,200
God, it's hot in here.

136
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,040
Could I go swimming?

137
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,299
Okay, but go straight there...

138
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,630
and then I come straight back.

139
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,719
And stay away from that boy.

140
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,470
You mean all boys, don't you?

141
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,399
You know which one
I'm talking about.

142
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,309
Dad, I'm not
12 years old anymore.

143
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,810
I know you're not...
That's the problem.

144
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,500
Now, keep your shirt on
till you get to the pool.

145
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,859
Have fun.

146
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,320
Ooh!

147
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,319
Hi.

148
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,070
Who are you?

149
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,250
Pinky.

150
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,909
What's your name?

151
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,079
Joleen.

152
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,580
Joleen? That sounds
kind of funny.

153
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,930
Look who's talkin', pinky.

154
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,840
You hear that?
What?

155
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,600
I hear your mother calling.

156
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,429
Hi.

157
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm Jimmy.

158
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,519
Hi, I'm...

159
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
I know.

160
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,439
I saw you watching them.

161
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,359
I don't know
what you're talking about.

162
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,110
Do you know
what they were doing?

163
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,200
Joleen!

164
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,619
Coming.

165
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,370
I have to go.

166
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,259
Jeez, it's beautiful.

167
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,659
You'd think people would be
out here enjoying it..

168
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,730
During prime time?
Are you joking?

169
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Start dinner, okay?
I'll be right back.

170
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,510
Hello?

171
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,389
Charlie Cox here,
temporary neighbor.

172
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,249
What is it?

173
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,859
Me and my daughter are stranded
here in your lovely town,

174
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,129
and we're wondering
if you had any gas to sell?

175
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,479
No. Beat it.

176
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,969
Thanks. Enjoy.

177
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,889
Don't give me that crap again!

178
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,050
But it's true!

179
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,079
What do you mean
you got no money?

180
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,029
Where's your mom?

181
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,029
At her sister's.

182
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,529
Listen, you're
late with the rent

183
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,460
a week and two days!

184
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,569
You got that?

185
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,580
What are you lookin' at?

186
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,120
You better cough up that cash...

187
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,799
I'm gonna kick your butts
outta here!

188
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,550
I ain't shit'n ya.

189
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,439
Hello?

190
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,340
Fuck off!

191
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,970
Hello? Charlie Cox here, temporary
neighbor and concerned parent.

192
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,629
Single parent...

193
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,980
former angry young man...

194
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,750
and poet laureate of the
interstate highway system.

195
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,020
And you're looking for
a little woman

196
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,879
to start a new life with?

197
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,740
Actually, I was looking for
a little cup of gasoline

198
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,160
to start an old car with.

199
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:42,350
You're not from
around here, are you?

200
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,289
Amy! A real human!

201
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,139
Please, God,

202
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,890
let it be a human
with some cigarettes.

203
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,810
Hi.

204
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,570
He's not from around here,
he smokes,

205
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,230
Let's go for the big win...

206
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,069
does he want a beer?

207
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,819
Sure.

208
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,989
What do I win?

209
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,150
You win a beer.

210
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,330
Alley-cop.

211
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,999
The price is kinda crazy,

212
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,319
if you got a little boy in your
home, regardless of the age,

213
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
stay with me on the next
item and take a look,

214
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:20,050
because there is
a remote controlled pickup...

215
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,089
this one is gorgeous!

216
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,430
Dinnertime!

217
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,830
Hey, Jo, sorry I'm late.

218
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,680
Oh, it looks like
we're going to have to

219
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,970
miss the first day of school.

220
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,560
Met a couple of people, though,
Louise and Amy.

221
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,510
Louise and Amy, huh?

222
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,309
Yeah, Louise and Amy, "huh".

223
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,440
They're stranded here,
just like us.

224
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,349
Take five dollars
off that price,

225
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,690
and we'll let it go
at a price of $12.50!

226
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,020
Just watch it!

227
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,359
Where have you been?
Out.

228
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,529
Out where?

229
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,690
Outside.

230
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,950
Dinnertime!

231
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,469
Thank God, some quiet.

232
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,799
Mm-hmm.

233
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,139
<i>They finally
turned that thing off.</i>

234
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,559
You know, if you
worked on a computer

235
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,480
like everyone else,
you'd be done by now.

236
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,730
Hey, dad,

237
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,655
do you mind if I go out
with a few bikers tonight?

238
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,400
You know, have some laughs?

239
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,580
Sure.

240
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,250
I thought you told him
you were finished.

241
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,580
I lied.

242
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,309
I guess your mom's right...
I am a bad influence on you.

243
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,640
You should see the guy
she's dating now.

244
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,410
Look, I'm really not ready to hear
about the men you're mom's dating.

245
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,430
I'm sorry.

246
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,110
You promised
aqua boy fish sticks!

247
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,789
They're too expensive.

248
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,510
These are just as good...
Eat 'em.

249
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,250
<i>I wanted aqua boy.</i>

250
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,760
They're the same.

251
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,259
They are not.

252
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,590
I'm warning you...

253
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,019
where's the coupon?
There's no coupon.

254
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,769
Just shut up and eat it!

255
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,519
If you loved us...

256
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,559
yum! Disodiumi-n-n-

257
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,609
nosinate pyrodoxide
hydrochloride.

258
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,949
<i>These are poison.</i>

259
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,649
Poison?
Poison.

260
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,819
Mommy...

261
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,570
they're good...

262
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,079
<i>they're good,
they're perfectly fine.</i>

263
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,579
Eat 'em!

264
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,960
Is that what your mom
and I sounded like?

265
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,740
No, you never sounded like
you hated each other.

266
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,469
That's because we didn't.

267
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,010
We loved each other.

268
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,830
A lot.

269
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,820
It's just that we
couldn't seem to...

270
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,390
do you still love her?

271
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,310
Yeah.

272
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,750
Do you think...

273
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,259
never mind.

274
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,739
What?

275
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,430
Nothing.

276
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,930
It's an unfair question.

277
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,720
Poison! Poison!
Poison! Poison!

278
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,639
<i>You promised us aqua boy!</i>

279
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,809
Yeech!

280
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,640
You little bitch!

281
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,119
Ooh, mommy said a bad word.

282
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,449
Get out of here!

283
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,200
Get the fuck in here

284
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,720
you little witch! Get
over there and sit down!

285
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,169
You're just like your father,
you little shit!

286
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,270
At least my father had the
good sense to leave you!

287
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,780
My first and, I guess,
last night in banco, Nevada.

288
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,219
It's probably one of the shittiest
places in the whole world.

289
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,889
I can't get the picture
of that poor man's body

290
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,759
<i>in the mini-mart
out of my mind,</i>

291
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,659
and the woman next door
won't shut up.

292
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,249
It's drmng me crazy.

293
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,030
On the other hand,
there's this boy, Jimmy.

294
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,839
Tall, intense eyes,

295
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,259
so incredibly gorgeous
I just want to die...

296
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,680
<i>and he likes me!</i>

297
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,079
Too bad we're leaving tomorrow.

298
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,260
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

299
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,140
this is going to
take some careful planning.

300
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,000
Hmm...

301
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,490
oh!

302
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,450
Oohhhh...

303
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,209
oh, God.

304
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,159
Aahhh!

305
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,660
Morning, Jo, birthday kiss!

306
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,410
Dad!

307
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,319
Not first thing in the morning!

308
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,070
Come on, Jo, I owe you one.

309
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,415
When we get back to L.A.,
I'm going to take out

310
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,290
<i>for a totally awesome
birthday dinner, dude.</i>

311
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,635
You can even bring that
boy I never liked.

312
00:30:56,636 --> 00:30:58,249
I'm not friends
with him anymore.

313
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,870
Happy Birthday.

314
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,900
We can go to
that place you love,

315
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,129
it'll be great...
Deal? Deal?

316
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,010
Aah!
Aah!

317
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,349
Dad!

318
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,519
Aah!

319
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,850
Up and at 'em!
Ow! Ow!

320
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,695
Alright, maybe 14 is too old
for a babysitter,

321
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:25,020
but you're not safe hanging
around here by yourself.

322
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,370
Anyway, Louise and Amy
are a lot of fun.

323
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:29,700
On my way!

324
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,380
I thought I'd help...
It's only fair.

325
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:36,700
Um, hi, I'm Louise.

326
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,869
Hi.

327
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,620
Happy Birthday, joleen.

328
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,290
Amy!

329
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,135
Get up!
Entertain joleen!

330
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,880
What is this, the loud patrol?

331
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,220
Bye.

332
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,969
He's so perky in the morning.

333
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,869
Your father's a good sport.

334
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,519
No, he's not...

335
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,859
he's single.

336
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,470
Oh.

337
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,480
Well, come on in,
we'll have some fun.

338
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,039
Yeah, see if that fits.

339
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,959
Thanks.

340
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,709
Hi. You're joleen's dad,
aren't you?

341
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,459
Right.

342
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,040
I'm pinky sears.

343
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,379
Nice to meet ya.
What's this?

344
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,129
It's a secret.

345
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,380
Say hi to your mom.

346
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,309
Nice kid.

347
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,480
Can we fill 'er up?

348
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:28,589
No.

349
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,660
The gas truck didn't come?

350
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,309
No.

351
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,399
Someone in Nevada's got to be
able to sell us some gas.

352
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,729
Well, I got a friend,

353
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,569
she lives out by two rock,
about 30 Miles out of here.

354
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,769
She might have some.

355
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,086
Lotta good that does us, there's
no way of getting up there.

356
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,079
I didn't say that.

357
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,670
You've got gas?

358
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,190
Yeah... personal stash
for emergencies.

359
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,449
Can you sell us some?

360
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,380
No, might give you
a ride out there, though.

361
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,580
How much?
Whatever you want.

362
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,339
You know, man,

363
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,089
you're really starting
to piss me off.

364
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,420
I told you already,

365
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,070
I no longer worship
at the alter of mammon.

366
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,679
The word "money"
means nothin' to me.

367
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,849
Mr. duckett?

368
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,870
Does the word "thai stick"
mean anything to you?

369
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,219
Yeah... jail.

370
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,969
How about "please"?

371
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,270
That's the word.

372
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,039
Mr. duckett,
this fence here...

373
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,790
it's federal land.

374
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,720
It's 27 Miles on the road
over to two rock,

375
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:43,629
and only ten in this direction.

376
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,469
Naturally, the dickheads
put up a fence.

377
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,389
Of course, we gotta boogie
through here pretty quick.

378
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,840
What kind of federal land?

379
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,600
Nuclear dump.

380
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,680
God, I love the desert!

381
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,770
I still love him...

382
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,529
so, um...

383
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,649
do you wanna play some cards?

384
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,780
Are you sure?

385
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,540
You want some potato chips?

386
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,289
No, thank you.

387
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,450
Okay.

388
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,289
Oh! My soap's
about to start,

389
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,789
want to watch some TV?

390
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,040
Um, I think I'm going to
go for a swim.

391
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,190
Okay.

392
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,160
Hey, viney.

393
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,660
Howdy-do, ducky?

394
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,330
That's my girl!

395
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,410
Hi.

396
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,009
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

397
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,259
Look, have you
got any gas to sell?

398
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,190
No.

399
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,899
Bummer.

400
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,649
Now, hold on,

401
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,980
there's gotta be some gas
in the tank's of these cars.

402
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,740
Nope, they drain 'em
when they bring 'em in.

403
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,110
'course I might not have gotten
to that one there.

404
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,949
And there might be
a gallon in this 'un.

405
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,280
Yeah, now that I think of it,

406
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,630
there might just be
quite a few gallons around here.

407
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,950
You brung me a live one, ducky!

408
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,220
I thought you didn't
worship at the alter of money.

409
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:53,690
I don't, but old viney here
is a true believer.

410
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,430
Ha ha ha!

411
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,269
September fourth...

412
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,019
Happy Birthday to me.

413
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,350
So here I am
at the pool again...

414
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,279
Madeline's always telling me
to go for it...

415
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,370
easy for her to say, I always
end up feeling like a geek.

416
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,249
Dad was right...
I'm keeping my shirt on today.

417
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,919
God, that was embarrassing
for him to see me like that.

418
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,760
I want him to kiss me,
but I'm really scared.

419
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,259
What if he's not around today?

420
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,099
What if he's gone somewhere?

421
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,260
<i>What if...
Hi!</i>

422
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,180
Did I scare you?

423
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,360
No, I just wasn't
expecting that.

424
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,100
I know who you're waiting for.

425
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,269
I'm not...

426
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,439
I know you like him,

427
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,189
but there's a lot about him
you don't know.

428
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,359
Like what?

429
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,109
You got a problem, pink-ass?
No.

430
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,859
Then what are you staring at?

431
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,029
Nothing.

432
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,779
You saying I'm nothing?

433
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,949
N- no, I was just...

434
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,119
just leaving.

435
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,450
I'll see you later, joleen.

436
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
Bye, pinky.

437
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,120
Come on.

438
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,890
Why are you so mean to him?

439
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,550
Because he's just too weird.

440
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,630
Come on.

441
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,969
<i>Come on.</i>

442
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,309
I can't.

443
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,390
My dad wants me to stay here.

444
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,910
Do you always do everything
your daddy says?

445
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,820
Come on.

446
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,820
Jimmy... Jim... James...

447
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,329
I wonder if he's got
another girlfriend...

448
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,830
I could ask, but it seems like
a pretty dumb question,

449
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,930
and he's definitely not the kind
of guy who likes dumb questions.

450
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,250
<i>So serious...</i>

451
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,929
something about him, though,
is a little scary,

452
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,260
sort of dangerous...

453
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,179
<i>but not really, not underneath.</i>

454
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,099
I know that's just me
being afraid.

455
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,020
<i>Well, here goes.</i>

456
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,090
Where to?

457
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,390
Um, I dunno, someplace cold.

458
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,310
Alaska, maybe.

459
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,230
Ah.

460
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,900
From your dad?

461
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,659
Yeah.

462
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,830
Yep.

463
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,260
You wanna go with me?

464
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,879
Wouldn't it be great?

465
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,099
Hawaii first, then Switzerland.

466
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,619
We could leave tonight...

467
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,740
I know where to get the money.

468
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,930
Are you hot?

469
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,010
That's a dumb question.

470
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,300
Ah!

471
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,300
Ha ha!

472
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,650
Stop!

473
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,149
Stop! Aah!

474
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,899
Jimmy! Stop it!

475
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,069
Jimmy! Aah!

476
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,230
Stop it!

477
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,569
Aah! No!

478
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,320
Stop it!

479
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,820
Jimmy, stop!

480
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,910
Get off of me!
Jimmy!

481
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,170
I'm gonna kill you!

482
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,340
Come on!

483
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,250
Get off me!

484
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,509
Come on!

485
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,090
Let go!

486
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,440
Drink it!

487
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,350
Drink it!

488
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,300
Where are we going, the moon?

489
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,020
Whoa!

490
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,180
Do you think
he's still out there?

491
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,010
Don't worry, joleen,
I'll protect you.

492
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,560
Your turn, you suck.

493
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,280
This is the last of them.

494
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,959
How much gas have we got?

495
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,330
Eleven gallons!

496
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:26,049
That's five and a half apiece.

497
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,719
Amy's rabbit gets
36 to the gallon...

498
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,720
that's 200 Miles,

499
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,229
that'll at least get us
back to California.

500
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,560
How far can you get
on five and a half gallons?

501
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,910
I only get about eight or
ten Miles to the gallon.

502
00:43:45,911 --> 00:43:51,150
Oh, well..
We can carpool,

503
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,489
we'll take the rabbit,
it'll be fun.

504
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,659
What, and leave my rambler here?

505
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,159
Yeah, the black market's
just bustin' for a gem

506
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,649
that gets a whole
nine to the gallon.

507
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,999
Okay, okay, are we done here?

508
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,419
I have to see if Jo's all right.

509
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,870
You know, when we were little,

510
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,670
me and Jimmy used to
hang together all the time.

511
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,219
You know, watch TV,
shoot bottles...

512
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,299
he used to be really nice.

513
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,639
My God, he's such a bastard.

514
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,139
I think he has problems at home.

515
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,309
Doesn't everybody?

516
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,480
I don't.

517
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,310
What's that?

518
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,450
A microwave relay...
Neat, huh?

519
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,800
Brings us TV.

520
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,249
Pinky!

521
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,999
Oh, my God.

522
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,170
Quick!

523
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,009
Pinky! Pinky!

524
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,890
I gotta fuckin' talk to her,
open this...

525
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,410
argh!

526
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,630
Joleen...

527
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,020
Joleen!

528
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,960
Warm.

529
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,480
Shit!

530
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,020
Mrs. Reed!

531
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,679
Mrs. Reed,
I need some ice,

532
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,010
the fridge shorted out again.

533
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,740
Mrs. Reed?

534
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,590
Hello?

535
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,520
What's the matter, 'fraidy cat?
This is only a tiny little bird.

536
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:04,010
Anybody home?

537
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,210
Aah!

538
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,600
My God, you scared me!

539
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,169
Is your mother home?

540
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,309
She's in the bathroom.

541
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,360
Can I sit down and wait for her?

542
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,449
Come on, get up that ladder!

543
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,320
No, I'm scared to go up high...

544
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,659
I get height-rophobia!

545
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,740
No, I don't wanna!
Come on...

546
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,670
you can't make me do it,
you can't make me!

547
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,930
Whoo! He do'd it!

548
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,050
Stay down.

549
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,309
I don't see him, where is he?

550
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,060
There.

551
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,070
It's okay now.

552
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,439
Oh, that was close.

553
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,360
Not that close.

554
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,029
Were you scared?

555
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,199
No.

556
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,360
You were too.

557
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,110
I was not scared.

558
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,669
Pinky, be careful.

559
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,289
Are you scared now?

560
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,509
No, get away from there.

561
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,679
Pinky, don't!

562
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,340
Scared now?

563
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,520
Pinky!

564
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,860
Pinky!

565
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,769
Are you scared now?

566
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,020
Yes, pinky, please!

567
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,899
That was the meanest,
dumbest, stupidest thing ever!

568
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,650
Hey, where you going?

569
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,819
Joleen...

570
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,739
wait, joleen!

571
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,870
I was only kidding!

572
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,640
Joleen...

573
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,130
hey, I thought
you'd think it was cool.

574
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,890
Well, I didn't.

575
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,630
What's the matter?

576
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,969
You shouldn't have done that.

577
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,720
It was dangerous
and it was mean.

578
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,140
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,900
Ah...

580
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,370
I guess Imng here
would drive anyone nuts.

581
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,250
I have a present for you.

582
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,760
Hold out your hand.

583
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,100
That was my dad's.

584
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,929
Pinky, you shouldn't...

585
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,679
you're worth it.

586
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,019
I know it isn't a girl thing,

587
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,519
but it's pretty...
Look at it.

588
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,269
It's very cool.

589
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,609
Is your dad in the army?

590
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,360
No, he's dead.

591
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,860
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,989
I gotta go.

593
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,660
If my dad gets back
before I do, he'll kill me.

594
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,260
I'm off to see the king!

595
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,060
Can I go, too?

596
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,970
Will it be fun there?

597
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,729
Oh yeah, you're going to
have a good time.

598
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,899
Do they have a TV?

599
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,649
Yeah, a big color set.

600
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,399
Can I get ice cream?

601
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,149
Sure, anything you want.

602
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,899
You just wait in here
for me, okay?

603
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,650
I'll be right back.

604
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,909
Will you keep an eye on her?

605
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,190
Sure.

606
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,579
You were supposed to be
looking after her, Amy.

607
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,749
I was looking after her.

608
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,910
Then where is she?

609
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,090
I don't know.

610
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,269
Shit.

611
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,019
Where the fuck were you?

612
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,190
I was at the pool.

613
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,945
Don't you lie to me.

614
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:17,690
You were with that boy,
Jimmy Reed?!

615
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,040
Agnes Reed is dead,
now she can wait!

616
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,289
For once in your life you're gonna
do exactly what I tell you.

617
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,050
You're going to
sit in this chair...

618
00:52:27,051 --> 00:52:28,669
look at me.

619
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,259
You're not gonna wander away,

620
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,870
you're not gonna see anyone,

621
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,470
you're not even gonna
look out the window.

622
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:35,179
Is that clear?

623
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,210
<i>Is that clear?!</i>

624
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,270
Good.

625
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,129
I hate him, I hate him...
Everything is so fucked!

626
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,749
I almost get raped
by a guy I trusted,

627
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,400
and the guy turns out to be a
killer... he killed his mother!

628
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,989
<i>And dad...</i>

629
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,829
I could have died
and he wouldn't have noticed.

630
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,760
He just doesn't
understand me at all.

631
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:32,899
Life is just totally unfair...

632
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,750
if it hadn't been for pinky...

633
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,920
he's really sweet, and he
lives out here in siberia

634
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,950
where I'll probably
never got to see him again...

635
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,619
dad won't even
let me go outside,

636
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:52,370
so I might possibly get to say
at least goodbye to him.

637
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,040
So, you think it was
like an accident?

638
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:02,140
Well, not unless a fan can fly.

639
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,720
A- ha.

640
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,710
I'll be damned.

641
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,460
Duckett, I'm gonna have to
secure this place

642
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,380
until our boys from the lab
can dust it.

643
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,060
I'm shy a few people... how'd
you like to be a deputy?

644
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:39,549
Does that mean
I'm not a suspect?

645
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,720
Oh, shoot.

646
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,059
Okay, bill.

647
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,149
No one gets in here without
your say-so... I'm ready.

648
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,400
Ha ha!

649
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,920
I don't know why you didn't
just bring the gas to the car.

650
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,250
Because I'm a fuckup, all right?

651
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,759
Get off my back.

652
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,679
It's like a furnace in here!

653
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,929
Lighten up, Charlie,
we're all on the same team here.

654
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,680
Great.

655
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,420
Sorry.

656
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,130
I just don't think this trip
with Jo was a good idea.

657
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:48,619
So are you gonna
divorce her too?

658
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,959
I don't think that's legal.

659
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,129
I'm a writer.

660
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,030
I'm supposed to be
so good with words...

661
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,560
I don't know what to
say to her anymore.

662
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,769
We're leaving now.

663
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,749
I wanted to talk to you
in person,

664
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,919
but my father is
holding me prisoner in here,

665
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,339
so I guess this note will
have to convey my appreciation

666
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,789
<i>for what you did for me today.</i>

667
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,790
<i>Ugh.</i>

668
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,599
Thank you for helping me today,

669
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,419
I know it took courage.

670
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,720
I like you a lot, and I know we
will see each other again one day.

671
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,880
Corn, ooh ooh, corn pah!
Oom, ooh ooh, ooh pah!

672
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:13,620
We're her friends

673
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,795
so we should know

674
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,370
today's her birthday

675
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,579
Happy Birthday, Jo!

676
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,329
We've got some gas

677
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,660
and it's time to go

678
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,590
let's leave this dump
before we start to glow!

679
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,690
It's time to go...

680
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,070
eew, it smells like gasoline
all over this place!

681
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,949
Smells like perfume to me.

682
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,870
Must be flooded, give it a rest.

683
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,539
Psst!

684
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,689
Hey, pinky!

685
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,740
Come here!

686
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,800
Hey!

687
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,070
What's up with you?

688
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,199
I thought you liked me.

689
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,360
I do like you.

690
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,699
So why are you leaving?

691
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,489
It's not my fault.

692
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,239
I mean, my dad,

693
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,570
he wouldn't even
let me say goodbye to you.

694
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,729
No...

695
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,659
what?

696
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,879
I won't say goodbye.

697
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,710
Oh, come on...

698
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,049
don't...
Wait, wait!

699
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,800
Aw, shit.

700
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,150
Jo, gimme a hand in here.

701
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,780
Thank you, Jesus.

702
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,999
Let's go,
L.A. or bust.

703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,749
I can't find my journal.

704
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,505
It's probably in the car.

705
00:59:17,506 --> 00:59:19,249
I'll take the back seat.

706
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,999
It's too cramped,
you'll be a mutant

707
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,749
by the time we
get to California.

708
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,169
If you guys are going to
bullshit all night, I'm leaving.

709
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,060
Nice language.

710
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,230
Jo, come on.

711
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,610
I'm not leaving without it.

712
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:05,360
Aah!

713
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,180
Amy!

714
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,920
Aah!

715
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,440
Aaah!

716
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,540
Daddy...

717
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,630
daddy.

718
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,060
Daddy.

719
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,270
Daddy.

720
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,540
Daddy!

721
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,179
It's okay, I'm here.

722
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,340
It's okay.

723
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,820
It's okay.
I'm here.

724
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,340
Having a party, pink face?

725
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,799
You're in a lot of trouble,
they're looking for you.

726
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,469
Shh! Well, they're
not gonna find me.

727
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,419
I'm gone, man, I'm outta here.

728
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,950
They can take this town
and shove it up their asses.

729
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,839
I need your help.

730
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,560
Reach out and touch
someone else.

731
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,890
Listen to me...

732
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,399
you are sick, and you
always have been,

733
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,649
so don't fuck with me!

734
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,820
Just do what I say.

735
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,540
Hey, buddy,

736
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:21,349
what you got for me this time?

737
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,680
Fan motor to mom's
air conditioner.

738
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,610
She didn't get the lifetime
guarantee... can you fix it?

739
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:29,520
I don't know, I'll take a look.

740
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,390
Looks like there's
a screw missing.

741
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,540
Blades are all bent up.

742
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,640
Don't screw around
with that thing, pink.

743
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,429
Hi, can I use the
phone in the office?

744
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,280
You can't go in there.

745
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,990
It's a secured area.

746
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,850
Pink, turn that damn thing
back where I told ya.

747
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,779
Come on, it's really important.

748
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,809
Okay, but be quick,

749
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,990
and don't touch any evidence.

750
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,919
Thanks, I owe you one.

751
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,009
Keep an eye on things for a
minute, I'll be right back.

752
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,175
All right.

753
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:37,510
Let's go take a look
at the unit.

754
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,429
Where you going?

755
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,885
Why don't you just let me fix
the whole thing at once?

756
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,210
Why are you bringin' it
to me piece by bit?

757
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,980
This is the only part
that's broken.

758
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,130
You're sure?

759
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,480
Can't you just
fix it on your bench?

760
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:52,639
No, man,

761
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,970
I gotta hook it up and see
what's wrong with it.

762
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,150
Wait!

763
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,500
Aw...

764
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,680
you have the right to remain...

765
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,569
you have the right to remain
there until the sheriff comes.

766
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,030
You okay?

767
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,150
Come on.

768
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,490
Watch your head!
Get in there!

769
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,990
The kid killed his own mother!

770
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,750
I'm the only thing
resembling a reporter

771
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,500
within Miles of this place!

772
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,500
That's really
uncalled for, Phil.

773
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,040
Hunh... okay,
that's fine with me.

774
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,969
Really... that's
fine with me,

775
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,310
I'm gonna write
the piece anyway.

776
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,390
All right, Cox, let's go.

777
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,720
When I get back,
we're outta here.

778
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:21,070
Jo, do me a favor and stay
up here with Louise.

779
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,560
Okay, daddy.

780
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,240
All right, girl,
let's go inside.

781
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,650
How can you hate your
mother so much?

782
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,970
You hear me?

783
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,229
It was easy.

784
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,560
She was an asshole, like you.

785
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,319
What about Amy?

786
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,660
What about Farrell hovis,
were they assholes, too?

787
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:05,740
I didn't kill nobody, okay?

788
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,840
Oh, yeah.

789
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,500
God, she must be
baking in there.

790
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,750
Mrs. sears?

791
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,540
Mrs. sears?

792
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,640
It's me, duckett.

793
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,879
Thanks.

794
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,630
Sure.

795
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,040
Mrs. sears?

796
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:01,130
Man, it smells rank in here.

797
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,239
Um, I'm gonna go for a swim.

798
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,650
Okay?

799
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,650
Louise?

800
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,530
Ma'am?

801
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,250
Mrs. sears?

802
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,040
Ma'am, are you okay?

803
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,120
You got a fever
or something, ma'am?

804
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,379
Holy shit!

805
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,550
Aah!

806
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:09,979
I'm really sorry,
Mr. duckett,

807
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:15,120
but you absolutely should
not have come in here.

808
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,920
Pinky?

809
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,930
Pinky?

810
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,660
Pinky?

811
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,900
Pinky?

812
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,989
Shhh!

813
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,739
You'll wake up mom.

814
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,079
Did I scare you?

815
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,410
No.

816
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,339
If you ever do that again,
I will kill you.

817
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,680
Do you want to
go up to the hill?

818
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,419
I shouldn't.

819
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,920
Come on!
The adventure continues.

820
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,920
Joleen!

821
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,820
He really hurt you.

822
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,930
So what do you want to do?

823
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,260
I don't know.

824
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,680
Let's just talk.

825
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,170
You can kiss me back
if you want.

826
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,179
Haven't you ever
kissed anyone before?

827
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,630
Of course.

828
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,980
Have you ever... done it?

829
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,020
Done what?

830
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:19,290
You know...

831
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:27,730
oh... that?

832
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:34,490
I seen it in the trailer park.

833
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,420
Yeah, me too.

834
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,689
First they kiss a lot.

835
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,690
French kiss.

836
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,740
And then they...

837
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,570

838
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,950

839
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,200
Joleen!

840
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,789
Ah!

841
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:21,709
Please...
The truck...

842
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,210
I'm just gmng you a chance to
tell your side of the story.

843
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,800
I'm just trying to
understand you, Jimmy.

844
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,889
There is one thing.

845
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,640
Come here.

846
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,560
<i>Come here.</i>

847
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,070
Watch it!

848
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:48,569
Hello, can anybody hear me?

849
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:52,070
Sheriff, pinky's got joleen!

850
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,970
Turn this car around,
come on! Come on!

851
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,379
He's at that condo

852
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,900
under construction
on Morgan path road.

853
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,219
I've gotta go.

854
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,220
No!
Ow!

855
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,550
That hurts!

856
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,320
I'm sorry.

857
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,390
You're really mean sometimes.

858
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,729
I won't be anymore.

859
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:22,400
I've just had a lot
on my mind lately.

860
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,990
I've got a super surprise
for you, joleen.

861
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:34,660
Isn't this cool?

862
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,419
Where did you get that?

863
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,160
It was my dad's.

864
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,000
You know what I'm talking about.

865
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,500
Let's play keep-away.

866
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,839
Give it back to me!

867
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,010
Keep away from joleen...

868
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,770
give it back to me!

869
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:55,019
"Madeline's always telling me
that I should just go for it.

870
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:59,100
"easy for her to say... i always
end up feeling like a geek.

871
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:02,030
You are so fucked!

872
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,690
I know you didn't mean that.

873
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,880
I trusted you!

874
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,599
Look, pinky...

875
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,510
I think you're in
a lot of trouble,

876
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,855
and they know how to
handle boys like you.

877
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:48,600
We can just go to your mom...

878
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,360
my mom!

879
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:56,779
My mom will always
be there for me.

880
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:00,860
Oh, pinky.

881
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:02,040
Jo!

882
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,039
Where are you going?

883
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,540
We were playing keep-away!

884
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,630
Okay...

885
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,130
hide 'n seek is fun, too.

886
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,970
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand,

887
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,979
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand,

888
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,899
five, one thousand,
six, one thousand,

889
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,480
seven, one thousand,
eight, one thousand,

890
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,619
nine, one thousand,
ten, one thousand.

891
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:43,870
Ready or not, here I come!

892
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,699
"I want something
really special for my birthday.

893
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,030
"I want Jimmy."

894
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,949
argh!

895
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:29,290
I hate that part!

896
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,239
Olly-olly-oxen-free!

897
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,990
Where are you?

898
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,260
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

899
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,580
Jo!

900
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,420
Jo, where are you?

901
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,790
Jo!

902
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,390
Jo! Jo!

903
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,720
Jo!

904
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,049
Daddy!

905
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,799
Jo, where are you!

906
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Daddy!

907
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,250
Gotcha!

908
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,469
That hurt, joleen.

909
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:10,550
Take that.

910
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,810
Ungh!

911
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,619
I'm goin' up here!

912
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,949
Jo! Jo!

913
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:28,620
Jo! Jo! Jo!

914
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:37,750
Joleen! Joleen!

915
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,839
Jo! Where are you!

916
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,150
Jo!

917
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,910
Joleen!

918
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,260
Aah!

919
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,440
Jo! Joleen!

920
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,419
What do you want from me?

921
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,580
Drop the knife, pinky!

922
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,089
Pinky, stop!

923
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:14,840
Daddy!

924
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:20,099
I- I'm sorry,

925
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,020
this just isn't working out.

926
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,810
I thought you loved me!

927
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,790
Aah!
Pinky!

928
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,720
Take my hand!

929
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,550
Goodbye.

930
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,070
Daddy!

931
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,509
Long before he ever met joleen

932
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,849
pinky started
slipping over the edge.

933
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:49,769
I think when his mom died

934
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:51,519
he just couldn't
believe she was gone,

935
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,439
so he just iced her down
and kept that old TV goin'

936
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,770
and did what he had to do.

937
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:59,699
He had to eat, so when he
went to the mini-mart

938
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,449
and Farrell tried to
stop him, he popped him,

939
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:07,289
and then Agnes came in
and wanted the rent...

940
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:10,800
it's just a shame.
A shame.

941
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:17,799
She'll be okay.

942
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,140
Thanks, man.

943
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,219
How much do you
want for the gas?

944
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:31,140
You're starting
to piss me off again.

945
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,180
Hey.

946
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:02,120
Stay out of trouble.

947
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,880
You too.

948
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,199
<i>All summer long</i>

949
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,399
I thought my dad was such a
geek and so full of shit,

950
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,819
which he was at times,
if you want to get technical.

951
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,410
But other times,
it's weird how right he was.

952
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:45,330
How is it that someone can be
so right and still be so wrong?
