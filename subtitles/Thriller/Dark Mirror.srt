1
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,007
- You promise to give
this one a chance.

2
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,345
- I'm not promising you nothing.

3
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,642
- Come on, Deb.

4
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,081
14 houses so far.

5
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,516
This cannot last forever.

6
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,882
- I just know what I like.

7
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,183
Just because you don't mind
living in some piece of shit...

8
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,750
- I don't want to live in a piece of shit.

9
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,497
- Well, thanks to Mommy,
you won't have to.

10
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,159
- Hmm.

11
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,065
- I'm sorry.

12
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,569
- Here we are.

13
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,441
- You're in for a treat.

14
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,577
It's not listed yet.

15
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,178
The family's out of state.

16
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,328
A famous painter once lived here.

17
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,391
- Oh, yeah?

18
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,902
- Yes, Rupert Wells.

19
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,268
Maybe you've heard of him.

20
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,772
- I wouldn't.

21
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,331
Deb?

22
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,173
- Name sounds familiar.

23
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,042
- Are you an artist?

24
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,013
- I'm a housewife.

25
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,074
- Uh, no, no,
she's a great photographer.

26
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,609
She just hasn't had time lately.

27
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,785
- I can imagine.

28
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,885
Two bedrooms, 13/4 baths.

29
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,490
It needs a little fixing,
but it's got some charming features.

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,625
Original hardwood floors.

31
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,693
The cut-glass windows

32
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,864
were imported from China,
and it's got built-in cabinetry and...

33
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,305
hey, hey, hey!

34
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,865
We're still painting!

35
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,898
- Come on, Ian.

36
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,031
- Hey, hon.

37
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,907
- Uh, we're still painting.

38
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,209
- Do you want to see
the rest of the house?

39
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,544
It's a little small for the price.

40
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,049
- We'll take it.

41
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,855
Are you sure?

42
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,794
- Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,319
What, you want to move back to Seattle?

44
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,422
- No, no, no, no, no.

45
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,992
No, I don't.

46
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,266
We'll make an offer.

47
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,294
- Great!

48
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,139
We'll go back to my office
and get started on the paperwork.

49
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,701
- All right.

50
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,759
- No, no, no, I'm not playing.

51
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,704
No, Jim, I'm not playing.

52
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,831
Stop it!

53
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,424
- I see you.

54
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,768
- Hey!

55
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,934
- God, you're such a dick!

56
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,603
- What happened?

57
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,633
- Nothing, baby.

58
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,906
Your dad just scared me.

59
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,937
- I got her good, Bud.

60
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,143
- Did you see that weird guy outside?

61
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,481
- What guy?

62
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,579
- He was out there.

63
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,852
He was... he was watching me.

64
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,224
- Hmm, probably just a nosy neighbor.

65
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,819
- I'm hungry.

66
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,057
- No, he... I'm telling you,
he wasn't just passing by.

67
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,761
He was... he was casing the joint.

68
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,332
Hey, we better get some pizza.

69
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,238
I got to get back to the office
for a couple of hours.

70
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,264
- Oh, tonight?

71
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,436
- I'm sorry.
I told you.

72
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,140
The weeks leading up to this project launch
are gonna be crazy.

73
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,809
- "Casing the joint."

74
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,222
- Whatever.

75
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,134
- I'm going to bed, baby.

76
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,573
Don't stay up too late.

77
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,136
- I'll be there soon.

78
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,170
- Hey, don't worry.

79
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:06,208
They're gonna love all your photos.

80
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,277
Good night.

81
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,418
Whoa.

82
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,408
click!

83
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,010
Ow.

84
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,948
Hey.

85
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,614
Have a good day.

86
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,786
- You too.

87
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,285
- You nervous?

88
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,248
Me too.

89
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,386
But we're tough.

90
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,123
We'll be all right.

91
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,688
You're supposed to agree with me.

92
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,097
- Okay.

93
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,503
- Okay, let's go.

94
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,923
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,153
Ooh, wow.

96
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,182
Mmm, this is nice.

97
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,490
This is really nice.

98
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,860
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,886
- Thank you.

100
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,920
Thanks.

101
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,298
- Mm.

102
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:54,102
Special.

103
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,539
- It's a great portfolio.

104
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,931
- Thank you very much.

105
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,036
- I'd like to see a few more product shots.

106
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,068
- Yeah.

107
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,171
- Sure.

108
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,149
- But it's great.

109
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,173
- Thanks.

110
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,519
- Thank you for stopping by.

111
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,993
- So is that it?

112
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,195
- Yeah, we can call you
if we need anything.

113
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,327
- Oh, okay.

114
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,361
- All right?
- Yeah, great.

115
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,804
- Awesome.

116
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,432
- Okay, terrific.

117
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,635
- Okay.

118
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,469
- Oh!

119
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,913
- Yo-ho-ho-ho!

120
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,938
- I'm so sorry about that.

121
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,382
- I hope you got my good side.

122
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,654
- Really great.
- Thank you.

123
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,622
- Thank you for coming in.
Bye-bye.

124
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,646
- Sorry about that.

125
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,766
- What the fuck was that?
Can you believe her shit?

126
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,598
- Use the freakin' focus ring, right?

127
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,864
- Goddamn art photos.

128
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,201
Oh, God.

129
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,833
- Oh, man, I'd fuck her, though.

130
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,399
- Jesus.

131
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,570
That's really disrespectful.

132
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,603
- Get the hell out of here.

133
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,445
"Disrespectful."

134
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,350
Shit.

135
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,959
Yes.

136
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,734
Oh, baby.

137
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,261
Thank God.

138
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,720
Hi, I'm Tammy.

139
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,026
- Deborah.

140
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,054
Nice to meet you.

141
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,694
- I was just finishing up.

142
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,033
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

143
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,799
I didn't mean to look in on you.

144
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,828
I was just...

145
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,431
- That's okay.

146
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,171
I'm a bit of an exhibitionist anyway.

147
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,270
- Oh, right on.

148
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,940
- You need anything to drink?

149
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,278
- No, thank you.

150
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,977
I'm good.

151
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,787
- You do yoga?

152
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,585
It looks like you got an okay body.

153
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,025
- I run sometimes.

154
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,119
- Mmm.

155
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,686
You know, I saw you move in the other day,

156
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,960
and I've been meaning
to come over and say hello.

157
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,263
I've just been so busy.

158
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,325
- Oh, what do you do?

159
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,932
- Well, I'm an actress

160
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,771
and a model.

161
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,108
I also do some singing
but not professionally.

162
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,376
- Wow, sounds exciting.

163
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,179
- Mmm, oh, it is.

164
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,276
So why did you move here?

165
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,117
- Oh, my husband got a job offer.

166
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,555
He's a computer programmer.

167
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,353
It's good money.

168
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,383
I just don't get to see him much anymore.

169
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,022
- Yeah, yeah.

170
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,622
Wow, computers, huh?

171
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,030
Hmm.

172
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,805
- Hey, do you know that lady
that lives right across from me,

173
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,329
my next door neighbor?

174
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,333
- Oh, God, Mrs. Yoshida?

175
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,073
Has she been watching you?

176
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,842
- Yeah, she has.

177
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,782
- She's obsessed with your house.

178
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,149
- Why?

179
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,120
- Well, because of that painter

180
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,621
that used to live there.

181
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,645
- What about him?

182
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,715
Was she in love with him or something?

183
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,751
- Oh, God, no.

184
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,786
Gross.

185
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,162
It's 'cause he disappeared.

186
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,598
I mean, he and his whole family.

187
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,533
They never found any of 'em.

188
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,696
Yeah, you didn't know that?

189
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,999
Oh, yeah.

190
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,939
Well, it must have happened
when she lived there,

191
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,374
I mean, because she watches
that place like a hawk.

192
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,741
Come to think about it,

193
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,575
she kind of watches
the entire neighborhood,

194
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,138
but, I mean, especially your place.

195
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,513
- Does she watch you too?

196
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,018
- Oh, yeah, like, all the time.

197
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- It doesn't bother you?

198
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,219
- Oh, well, I mean, it used to.

199
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,316
But after a while I was like, whatever.

200
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,348
Fuck it.

201
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,724
Let the bitch look, right?

202
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,888
I mean, she wishes she looked like me.

203
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,404
- Are you listening to me?

204
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,239
- You know, babe, there's something really
strange about this place.

205
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,210
We have some weird neighbors.

206
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,076
- I was talking about the assholes at work.

207
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,205
- I'm sorry.

208
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,249
Well, there's always at least
one asshole in every office.

209
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,189
And if you don't see him,
that means that you're the asshole.

210
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,596
- Weird neighbors...
you mean like Tammy?

211
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,896
- You've met her?

212
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,923
- Yeah.

213
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,960
Ian and I were cleaning out the garage
the other day,

214
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,734
and she came by and said hello.

215
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,899
- That's funny.

216
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,876
She didn't mention that,
and neither did you.

217
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,902
- I didn't think about it.

218
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,076
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,748
- Is my massage done already?

220
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,622
So what did you think of Miss Tammy?

221
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,356
- What do you mean?

222
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,864
- Did she tell you she was an actress?

223
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,299
- Honey, she is so hot
I forgot everything she said.

224
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,495
- You are an asshole!

225
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,503
- I'm the king of all assholes!

226
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,909
- Of course Matt doesn't like it.

227
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,936
He's an idiot.

228
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,972
His parents are probably idiots.

229
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,576
The guy has no freakin' taste.

230
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah, would you shut up
and listen to me for a minute?

231
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,349
We'll pitch it to the client, okay?

232
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,652
Let him decide.

233
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,683
He's gonna love it,
and then Matt's gonna take credit

234
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,594
for the whole freakin'...

235
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,792
Yeah, I'm listening.

236
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,357
Look, can we
talk about something else?

237
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,663
Thank you.

238
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,102
About how we're gonna... yes.

239
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,126
Where are we goin' tonight?

240
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,161
What's the plan?

241
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,867
Hang on a second.

242
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,122
- Ian.

243
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,626
- Duh-eee!

244
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,661
- Ian!

245
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,230
Come on, I'm trying to work.

246
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,300
Go outside.

247
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,333
Stay right outside.

248
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,492
Ian?

249
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,564
Ian?

250
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,335
Ian?

251
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,118
Ian!

252
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,406
- Debbie!

253
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,074
There you are.

254
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,207
- Yeah, Mom.

255
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,718
Here I am.

256
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,720
What are you...

257
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,415
Have you seen Ian?

258
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,821
- He's out there.

259
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,290
He's so cute.

260
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,296
Why didn't you call
and tell us you were coming?

261
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,200
- Because I wasn't sure
what you would say.

262
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,171
- Oh, please, Mom.

263
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,639
It was one argument.

264
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,938
It's not like it was our first.

265
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,376
Besides, it doesn't mean
you can't come and visit.

266
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,889
- You're smoking again.

267
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,991
- Not really, just once in a while.

268
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,365
- Is Jim...

269
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,391
- No, Mom.

270
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,131
Everything's fine with Jim.

271
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,036
Ian, Ian.

272
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,907
Hey, baby, come in here
and say hi to your grandma.

273
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,380
Come on, come here, baby.

274
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,280
Go give grandma a kiss.

275
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,118
Ian!

276
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,146
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,818
He just gets shy sometimes.

278
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,264
- He's wonderful.

279
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,232
These windows are beautiful.

280
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,394
- The glass is imported from China.

281
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,734
- Oh, then it's Fun Shooey.

282
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,760
- What?

283
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,501
- You should try it.

284
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,238
It's the ancient Chinese art
of furniture arrangement.

285
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,269
- Oh, feng shui.

286
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,838
I have a book on it.

287
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,872
- Did you know that they

288
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,886
put mirrors along the window ledge

289
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
to scare the evil spirits away?

290
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,888
- Well, in some more remote parts,

291
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,824
the glass was
also considered to be

292
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,918
a vessel for the spirits.

293
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:34,057
You see, a spirit would be
attracted to the glass,

294
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,327
but when it got close to it,

295
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,165
it would get trapped inside,
and then it couldn't get out.

296
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,761
This way, it couldn't hurt anyone.

297
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:44,832
- So this glass will protect your family.

298
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,243
Isn't that nice?

299
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,581
Are you doing some research?

300
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,585
- Huh?

301
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,247
- All these library books.

302
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,383
- Oh, yeah, I guess I am.

303
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,757
A famous painter lived in our house.

304
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,886
- In this house?

305
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,489
- Yeah, there's, like,
a mystery about him or something.

306
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,658
- A mystery?

307
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,133
Oh, look.

308
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,136
That must be him

309
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,637
In front of this house.

310
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,834
- The whole family disappeared.

311
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,901
- Wonder what happened to them.

312
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:26,214
And her name is Eleanor.

313
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:40,853
- Mom!

314
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,922
- Oh, Ian.

315
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,936
- The door's locked!
I can't get out!

316
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,959
- All right, honey.

317
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:46,993
Hang on a second.

318
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,872
Just hang on.

319
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,898
- The handle came off!

320
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:53,967
Oh, my God.

321
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,980
- Don't laugh!
Help me!

322
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,242
- Okay, baby, don't worry.

323
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,271
We'll fix it.

324
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,544
- Open the door!

325
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,052
Open the door!

326
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,021
- Jesus, kid, take it easy.

327
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,379
- Help!

328
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,221
- Baby, baby, listen to me!

329
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,887
The handle on your side of the door,
slide it through.

330
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,055
The handle,

331
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,793
put it through
the hole in the door!

332
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,459
Oh, baby.

333
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,834
It's okay.

334
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,304
Oh, God.

335
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,397
- Why'd you laugh at me?

336
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,308
You're mean.

337
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,607
- Mm.

338
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,743
- Come on.

339
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:38,814
- Come on, please?

340
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,017
Look in the mirror for me.

341
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,083
- Do we have to do this right now?

342
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,151
It's been a long day.

343
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,752
- I know, but when else am I gonna do it?

344
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,957
You're never home.

345
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,987
Please?

346
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,001
- "Please."
Okay.

347
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,094
All right.

348
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:56,870
- All right, look in the mirror
toward the hallway now.

349
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,136
Do you see the door?

350
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,165
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,467
This is stupid.

352
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,912
- Okay, come on.

353
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,141
Now just put your head closer.

354
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,706
- Stop, stop, that tickles.
- All right.

355
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,479
Just put your head closer to the wall now.

356
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,508
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,453
What do you see now?

358
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,547
- I see the door again.

359
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,785
Oh.

360
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,123
- Yeah, but it's not the same door.

361
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,458
It's a different door.

362
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,295
All right, just pull away from it
and then lean back in.

363
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,338
Okay.

364
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,867
Our hallway has one door.

365
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,972
This one, right here.

366
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,004
The hallway in the mirror

367
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,107
has two doors.

368
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,517
The other one should be here.

369
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,718
Just look in the mirror for me.

370
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,292
- I'm confused.

371
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,264
What are you saying?

372
00:28:54,299 --> 00:29:01,000
- Honey, the hallway in the mirror
is not our hallway.

373
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,973
- No?
Well, whose hallway is it?

374
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,874
- Babe, I'm telling you there's
something strange about this house.

375
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,899
I've seen...

376
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,139
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

377
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,874
This isn't about the door.

378
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,510
All right, there's nothing wrong
with this house, okay?

379
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,713
Do you...
do you hear what you're saying?

380
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,089
It's crazy.

381
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,287
- No, it's not.

382
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,558
It's not, baby, if you would
just take another look.

383
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,091
- Deb, will you please...
I'm fuckin' tired, okay?

384
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,295
Will you drop it?

385
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,031
I'll look at your
imaginary door tomorrow.

386
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,403
I promise.

387
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,137
And you have to promise me
that you're gonna get out of this house.

388
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,305
- Hi, I wanted to speak with Chad Walker.

389
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,873
I had interviewed with him last week,

390
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,284
and I just wanted to follow up
and see if he had any photo jobs

391
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,880
or help with anything.

392
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:56,155
- Actually, it doesn't look like
he works here anymore.

393
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,662
He hasn't shown up to work
in over a week.

394
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,685
No one knows where he is.

395
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,967
I think he embezzled some money
and ran off with Stacy from Finance.

396
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,991
- Thank you.

397
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,503
I got to go.

398
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,069
Look, I'm going
a little stir-crazy at home.

399
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,046
I just want to get back to work.

400
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
- Look, I run a very small operation here,

401
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,780
and I got a couple of guys
that do most of the work for me.

402
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,684
- So, spread it around a little, you know?

403
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,709
Throw some my way.

404
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,780
- I got to fix this piece of shit.

405
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,623
- What do you say?

406
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,166
- You know, I'd like to help you out.

407
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,763
- So help me out.

408
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,864
- Well, actually,
"I'd like to help you out"

409
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,602
Is a bunch of bullshit
that most people say.

410
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,880
Look, even if I could hire you,

411
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:56,285
this is about all I could afford
to pay you.

412
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,816
- That's less than the cost of day care.

413
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,761
If I go back to work...

414
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,093
- Well, I told you the pay was crap.

415
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,427
Besides, I got the guys I need.

416
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,454
You know...

417
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,542
In the meantime, it's, you know,
know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

418
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,776
- I have to go.

419
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,341
I have to go.

420
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,353
I've got a lot of meetings.
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,166
bang!

422
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,180
- Hey! Come on!
Oh, my God.

423
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,408
Look what you did to my car!

424
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,437
Look at the car!

425
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,539
- There's no damage.

426
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,677
- No damage?

427
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,311
You get out!

428
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,878
I'm gonna bash your fuckin' skull in!

429
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,986
What do you think you're doing?

430
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,760
Oh, now, what are you doing?

431
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,993
A camera?

432
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,331
What are you gonna do with a camera?

433
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:19,861
Stop with the camera, bitch!

434
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,372
You fuckin' ruined my car!

435
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,897
I'm telling you right now,

436
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,204
get out of the car.

437
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,811
I'm gonna bash your skull in!

438
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,906
- Am I late?

439
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,742
I'm sorry, honey.

440
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,371
I'm so sorry.

441
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,247
It won't happen again.

442
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,720
I know I haven't been the best mom lately,
but that's gonna change.

443
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,622
I promise.

444
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,990
I promise.

445
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,733
You scared the...

446
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,837
you scared me badly.

447
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,869
What's up?

448
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,381
- You're vacuuming.

449
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,384
- Yeah?

450
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,749
What?

451
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,847
What?

452
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,722
The fireplace?

453
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,753
What about it?

454
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,190
Oh, baby.

455
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,702
You're afraid of it?

456
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,761
That's just the wind.

457
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,573
When the wind blows through the chimney,
it makes that sound.

458
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,875
If you'll come take a look over here,
you'll see there's nothing there.

459
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,537
Come on.

460
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,311
Come look.

461
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,546
Huh.

462
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,082
Actually, there is something up there.

463
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,960
It's on the ledge.

464
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,865
- No!

465
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,563
- Don't worry.

466
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,572
It's okay.

467
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,210
Oh, got it.

468
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:05,094
# #

469
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,577
Wow.

470
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,214
Wow.

471
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,377
- Pill for weight loss,

472
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,511
and soon consumers may be able
to get it over the counter.

473
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,680
On tonight's health report,

474
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,781
a drug that blocks
the body's absorption of fat.

475
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,292
Overweight patients say
it's changed their lives.

476
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,352
The prescription version of the drug

477
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,762
has more than double the dose
of the over-the-counter,

478
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,529
which might cause some negative reactions
to the pill's availability.

479
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,300
- Deborah?

480
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,676
- Shh.

481
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,581
Ian's asleep.

482
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,878
- A Northridge woman has gone missing,

483
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,143
and Los Angeles police are asking
for your help finding her.

484
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,171
- Oh, shit.

485
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,877
- 42-year-old Mallory Kuttner

486
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,010
was last seen
leaving her work around noon.

487
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,041
- What?

488
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,147
- I've seen that woman.

489
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,283
- Her vehicle is still at the parking lot.

490
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,885
- What are you talking about?

491
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,020
- But there is no sign of her.

492
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,428
Police are investigating
the woman's disappearance

493
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,695
but have not ruled out
kidnap or murder.

494
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,793
Although a ransom note
has not been found,

495
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,464
police agree Kuttner disappeared
under suspicious circumstances.

496
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,939
- I've seen her.

497
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,963
- That woman?

498
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,376
- She was screaming at me.

499
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,401
- That woman?

500
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,607
You sure?

501
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,813
- Yeah.

502
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,947
- I found out some more
on your painter, Wells.

503
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,184
I do love a good mystery.

504
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,285
- Mom, I'm really not in the mood.

505
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,694
- Listen to this.

506
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,324
"Wells had a hard time
establishing himself.

507
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,960
None of his early work
was taken seriously."

508
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,501
- Uh-huh.

509
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,167
- It was when he'd gotten married
and moved into your house

510
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,302
that his style changed.

511
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,542
The paintings became completely different.

512
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,048
Critics started paying attention.

513
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,644
- Got you, bitch.

514
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,779
- What was that?

515
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,789
- Nothing, Mom, nothing.

516
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:50,351
- His painting style changed so much that...
and I'm reading here...

517
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:54,524
"Some members of the press suggested
he was in some way possessed."

518
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,533
- Deborah!

519
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,761
Deborah!

520
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,737
- Hey!

521
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:01,760
Mom, I got go.

522
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,795
- Wait...

523
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,898
- I'm sorry, Mom, I got to go.

524
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:04,930
- There's more...

525
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,772
- What you up to?

526
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,802
- Nothing.

527
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,674
Okay, one minute.

528
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,211
- Come on in.

529
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:22,157
I'll fix us some drinks.

530
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:28,526
So what are we taking pictures of?

531
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,555
- Well...

532
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,261
- Apple martini okay?

533
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,100
- Oh, yeah, that sounds
really good right now.

534
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:39,440
- Awesome.

535
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,345
So...

536
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,475
Yoshida still bothering you?

537
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,643
- Kind of.

538
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,586
But it's... it's not just her.

539
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,747
I've been seeing things:

540
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:58,126
someone, this guy,

541
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,562
I guess you could call it
"lurking around."

542
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,396
But I mean,
I think he's stalking me.

543
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,959
- No shit.

544
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,227
Oh, wow.

545
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,207
That is scary.

546
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,076
You know, there are a lot
of stalkers here in L.A.

547
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,579
I mean, trust me, honey.

548
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,603
I've had my share.

549
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,047
- Have you?

550
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,846
- Oh, yeah.

551
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,375
You know what you need?

552
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,409
- What's that?

553
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,084
Oh.

554
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,020
Whoa.

555
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,827
- Yeah, it's cute, isn't it?

556
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,333
- Do you know how to use that thing?

557
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,996
- Shit, yes.

558
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,267
I go to this little gun range
in the valley all the time.

559
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,295
You should come with me.

560
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,329
It's a lot of fun.

561
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,241
- Okay.

562
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,575
- Fuck you, asshole.

563
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,840
Give me the money.

564
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,584
- That's very convincing.

565
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,485
That's really good.

566
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,116
- Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

567
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,896
So how's Jim?

568
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,661
Is he getting along any better
with those assholes at work?

569
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,657
- What?

570
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,499
- Mmm, excuse me.

571
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,130
Hello?

572
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,664
Oh, hi, honey!

573
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,698
Uh-huh.
It's my agent.

574
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,937
I'll talk to you later.

575
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,606
Uh-huh.

576
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,908
- Hey, babe.

577
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,975
Mm.

578
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,112
We're off to work.

579
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,189
- Is Mom okay?

580
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,992
She's being kind of weird.

581
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,020
- Don't worry.

582
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,054
She's fine.

583
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,897
You got everything you need
for the sleepover?

584
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:18,924
- Yeah, yeah.

585
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,371
- Oh, no.

586
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,954
Mrs. Yoshida?

587
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:53,231
Are you okay?

588
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,795
Mrs. Yoshida?

589
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,547
Jim?

590
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:34,786
- Hey.

591
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,323
- Hi.

592
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,528
- You been sleeping all day?

593
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,232
- What's going on out there?

594
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,569
- Cops were just next door.

595
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,098
Miss Yoshida's gone missing.

596
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,111
Her son called 'em
when he couldn't reach her

597
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,079
on the phone today.

598
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:54,278
Did you see her leave?

599
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,286
- I had a weird dream.

600
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,312
- Hmm.

601
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,690
- Um, no.

602
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,996
No, I didn't see her leave.

603
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,733
- She probably wandered off.

604
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,137
Shouldn't have been living alone,

605
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,165
not at her age.

606
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,267
- His wife painted this.

607
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,935
- That explains why his style
changed so much

608
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,239
when he moved here.

609
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:05,078
She painted all of them,
and then he took the credit.

610
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,582
- Until they disappeared.

611
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,983
- Until he killed her.

612
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,010
There was a sketchbook behind the frame.

613
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,022
It's like a diary.

614
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,024
Eleanor was afraid of her husband.

615
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,253
At first she was happy
to just have her paintings seen,

616
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,625
but then she wanted to stop.

617
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,220
She was frustrated,

618
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,061
but she was afraid
of what he would do to her

619
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,067
if she tried to leave him.

620
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,228
- He couldn't live without her paintings.

621
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,760
- She was miserable.

622
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,205
She became more and more
frightened and paranoid.

623
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,141
Mom, she actually believed

624
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:37,112
that she could make things happen
by drawing them.

625
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,605
She writes about sketching things,
events, objects,

626
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,640
and then they come true.

627
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,007
- Which makes you wonder,

628
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,177
why would she paint this?

629
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,347
- Okay.

630
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,518
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

631
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,654
But just go through the pictures.

632
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:30,189
- I wouldn't know how.

633
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,257
- All right, first of all,

634
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,566
there are all these pictures
that I didn't take.

635
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:35,798
I mean, maybe I left my camera on.

636
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,307
- What do you mean?

637
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,331
- That's Mrs. Yoshida.

638
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,469
She's the next-door neighbor,
and she's missing.

639
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,479
Her son's going nuts looking for her.

640
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,310
And then that's the woman
from the parking lot.

641
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,010
Gone; nobody knows where.

642
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,610
And this one... that's the first guy.

643
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,247
I mean, he was a jerk but...

644
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:57,727
- Debbie, what are you saying?

645
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:05,532
- Mom, everyone I photograph
with this camera vanishes.

646
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,031
Ma.

647
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,145
- What does Jim think about all this?

648
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,046
- I haven't told him, Mom.

649
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,017
He thinks I'm crazy enough as it is.

650
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,041
- Debbie, I don't know.

651
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,144
This is all so...

652
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,586
- Mom, listen to me.

653
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,613
Rupert Wells is out there.

654
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,783
He took Eleanor,

655
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:33,091
and now he's taking everyone
that I photograph.

656
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,325
- Forget about the camera.

657
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,595
- No, Mom, you're not listening to me.

658
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:42,128
- You have a nice house,
a wonderful family.

659
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,730
Take care of them.

660
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:48,871
If you take care of them,
everything will be all right.

661
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,350
You're bad.

662
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,941
You're terrible.

663
00:51:58,982 --> 00:51:59,971
- You're a doll.

664
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,040
Oh, get out of here.

665
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,642
You are dangerous.

666
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:09,383
It's really weird about Mrs. Yoshida, huh?

667
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,893
- Yeah.

668
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,989
- Hmm, well, I'll see you soon.

669
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,361
- Okay.

670
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,764
- I'll see you around.

671
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,701
- See you.

672
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:47,754
- Deb, I'm home.

673
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:53,927
Just for dinner, though.

674
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,939
I got to back to work
and work an all-nighter.

675
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,736
And I work tomorrow too.

676
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,749
Deb?

677
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,151
You home?

678
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,516
Didn't you hear me?

679
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,585
- Huh?

680
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,722
What?

681
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,995
- What are you doing?

682
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,331
- Nothing.

683
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,630
Nothing.

684
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,033
- Okay, don't tell me.

685
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,609
There's nothing to tell.

686
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:38,603
I'm just gonna...

687
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,742
I'm gonna go start dinner now, okay?

688
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,756
Deborah!

689
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,657
Oh, my God.

690
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,761
It worked.

691
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,536
Where's that camera?

692
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,409
Where is it?

693
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,827
Ian!

694
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,960
- Ow!

695
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,436
You get away from us!

696
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,837
Ian, come on, we have to go.

697
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,862
Ian, now!

698
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,240
Let's go inside!

699
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,693
Ian.

700
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,032
It's okay, baby.

701
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,196
The pictures are gone.

702
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,798
They can't hurt you now.

703
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,809
Look, Mommy smashed them to pieces.

704
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:41,832
Ian.

705
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,369
It's all right!

706
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,746
Ian!

707
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,807
Ian!

708
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,314
It's all in the glass.

709
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,299
- There must be a way out.

710
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,407
Ian!

711
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,240
Ian.

712
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,905
You stay away from him!

713
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:16,742
It's all right.

714
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:17,775
Stay right here.

715
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,014
I don't want you to move.

716
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,388
Stay there, okay?

717
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,148
- Dad!

718
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,322
- Baby, are you okay?

719
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,091
thwack!

720
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,182
- Ian?

721
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,954
Ian, are okay?

722
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:33,951
- Deb, go back to sleep.

723
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,430
I got to think.
- Mommy?

724
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,659
I'm scared.

725
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,565
- Stay in your room, Ian!

726
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,763
- Everything's gonna be okay, baby.

727
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:56,083
- Jim, listen, we need to get him safe.

728
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,176
You got to listen to me, baby.

729
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,653
You got to trust me.

730
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,678
Our baby's in danger.

731
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,418
You're in danger.

732
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:09,160
- I didn't believe it at first.

733
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:14,932
Then I found you lying in
Yoshida's blood, unconscious.

734
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,871
I had to cover for you.

735
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:26,272
I had to protect you.

736
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,449
- You think I killed her?

737
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,582
You think...

738
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,618
you think I killed her?

739
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,461
You think I'm crazy?

740
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,899
No, no, it wasn't me.

741
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,369
It was Rupert Wells,
the painter that lived in this house.

742
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,168
He killed her.

743
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,604
- I just need to know.

744
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,944
What did you do with the bodies?

745
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,576
- No, listen to me.

746
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,848
He was taking the credit
for his wife's paintings,

747
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:07,287
and when she tried to leave him,
he killed her.

748
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,086
He killed all of them.

749
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,492
- Tell me what you did
with the bodies!

750
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,553
Tell me!

751
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:21,264
- All I did was take pictures of them.

752
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,295
I didn't do anything.

753
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,383
- We're going back to Seattle.

754
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,681
We're gonna find you help.

755
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,948
- No, no, no, no, we can't.

756
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,751
Jim, we, we can't go back there.

757
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,779
He'll find us.

758
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,086
He'll get us.

759
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,285
No matter where we go,

760
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,453
he'll find us,
just like he found Eleanor

761
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,655
and everybody else.

762
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:48,720
- There is no Rupert.

763
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,061
There is no Eleanor.

764
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,088
You are sick!

765
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,122
You're sick!

766
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,157
- Listen to me.

767
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,191
We can't leave this house.

768
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,466
This is the only thing
that's keeping us safe.

769
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,938
The glass is protecting us.
- Stop it!

770
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,201
- We have to find another way out.

771
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,230
- Shut up.

772
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,709
- We have to find the door in the mirror.

773
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,904
- Stop talking like that!

774
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,412
You're freaking me out!

775
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,971
- Call my mother.

776
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,778
Call my mother.
We did the research together.

777
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,876
She has proof.

778
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,815
- What?

779
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,422
- Deborah,

780
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:25,457
your mother's been dead for five years.

781
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,375
- I know that!

782
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,044
She killed herself.

783
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:46,480
My mother killed herself.

784
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,514
I know that.

785
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:26,293
- Wake up.

786
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,627
We better hurry
before they wake up.

787
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:33,157
Wake up.

788
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:41,440
- Eleanor was a prisoner in the house.

789
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,571
When she couldn't get out,
she found another way.

790
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,811
- Deeper into the house.

791
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,708
- Into her own world.

792
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,752
It's kind of funny.

793
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,561
- What is?

794
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:04,396
- You and I getting along.

795
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:26,614
Eleanor.

796
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,378
It was you.

797
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,478
You killed them.

798
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,182
You were trapped in the house.

799
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:37,715
Rupert made it a prison.

800
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,785
The glass wasn't meant to keep evil out.

801
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,025
It was meant to keep you in.

802
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:47,001
So you went crazy,

803
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:52,633
and you killed them all

804
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,235
with my hands.

805
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,788
- No.

806
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,126
No, no, no!

807
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,927
Eleanor!

808
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,658
Stop!

809
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,966
No!

810
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:28,069
Oh, no.

811
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,616
No.

812
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:46,848
No.

813
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:51,882
Stop!

814
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:57,695
No, no!

815
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,692
Ian!

816
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,722
No, please don't.

817
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,223
- I don't want to wake up, Mommy.

818
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:42,887
- We don't know what happened
to the bodies.

819
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:53,291
- Did you follow the blood trail?

820
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,327
- Look at this.

821
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,669
Rubbernecker.

822
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,467
- What?

823
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:34,839
- Neighbor trying to take a look.

824
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,950
- It's your reflection.

825
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,977
Dumb ass.

826
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,738
- # Hate to admit it #

827
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,905
# But you were right all along #

828
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:50,816
# Turns out I was just a mirage #

829
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,878
# 'Cause he tried to touch me #

830
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,948
# But his hand went right through #

831
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,823
# Strange enough #

832
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:03,194
# All I thought of was you #

833
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:10,264
# Floodgates are open #

834
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:14,901
# But on the other side there was nothing #

835
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:19,346
# It was all just behind #

836
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,373
# So when he asks the question #

837
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:25,386
# "Why did you bother to lie?" #

838
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:31,222
# "I just wanted something
good enough to hide" #

839
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:36,492
# Was my reply #

840
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,694
# And I can't help but feel changed #

841
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,430
# Parts of me ruined #

842
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:48,636
# From everything that's happened #

843

# But I don't want to be someone #

845
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,282
# Who can't believe in magic #

846
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,723
# So I pretend that I'm amazed #

847

851
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:19,372
# "Did time make me look smarter?" #

852

# I asked in the parking lot #

853
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,540
# He said my hair's gotten longer #

854
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,515
# But I still hide in talk #

855
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,519
# And I thought I knew by now #

856
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,488
# Questions only lead to answers #

857
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:39,789
# You never could allow
any scripted banter #

858
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,826
# I don't want to feel plain #

01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,028
# Hate to admit it #

865
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:27,064
