on her credit card,

in cash.

Thanks, babe.

-Yeah.

So, um, Marvin
came to see me today.

-Again?

659
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,362
Is he okay?

660
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:42,065
-Yeah. Yeah, we went to lunch.

661
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,601
-Oh. Cool. Did you guys
do some catching up?

662
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,102
It's been a while, hasn't it?

663
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,737
-It has.

We don't exactly travel

-Hmm. It's true.

Oh, well, good.
I hope it was fun.

667
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,946
-It was. It was fun.

668
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,217
I'm gonna loan him some money.

669

Oh, Jesus.

670
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,654
-If it's okay with you.

671

-How much?

Just like that?

676
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,766
-It's not like we don't have
the money, Claire.

-It's not like we're rich,
either, kip.

-We can spare it.

679
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:22,071
You know he hasn't worked
for months.

680
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,674
Honestly, what kind of a friend
would I be

681
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,942
if I just let him go under?

-Well, what kind of friend
is he?

683
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,412
Let me get this straight.

684
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,881
He shows up out of the blue,
wants to go to lunch with you,

685
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,350
at which he then proceeds
to ask you for money.

-No.
It wasn't like that.

We...Were talking,

688
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,123
and I found out the straits
he was in,

689
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,324
and...I offered.

690
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,593
-You offered?!
-Yeah.

691
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:46,696
-And you didn't feel like
he entrapped you

692
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,731
with his long tale of woe?

693
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,966

then okay.

preferred cash or check.

for you the other night?

And that was
a really big favor, too.

775
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,861
And the reason I did it --

776
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:14,764
hell, look,
I was glad to do it --

777
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:19,335
was because you were in danger
of losing everything.

778
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,372
And, brother,
I know what that's like.

00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:26,742
I lost everything.

00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,114

00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:37,720
I just --
I didn't want that for you.

783

anyone who might dig him.

-No.

788
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,537
I'm not setting up any
of my friends with Marvin.

789
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,073
-Why?

790
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,374
-Because he's not cute.

791
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,010
He's...Unemployed.
He's weird.

792
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,812
And frankly,
he's a little creepy.

793
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,981
-Creepy?
-Yeah.

794
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,249
Forget all you know about him

795
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,084
and just consider
if you met him today.

796
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,785
You'd never even talk
to a guy like that.

797
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,922
-How can you say that?
He's one of my best friends.

798
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,457
-That you never hang out with

and you don't have anything
in common with.

I take it he came by your office
again today.

801

-So what if he did?

802
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,900
-Ohh. Jesus!

803
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,234
How needy is this guy?

804
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,169
It's like he's stalking you
all of a sudden.
