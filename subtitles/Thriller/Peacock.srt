00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,400
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

159
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,066
?
You looking for this

(GASPS)

161
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
Oh, my.
I got it.

162
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,938
CONNOR: Come on, birdie.

163
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,107
FANNY: Connor, it's over there.

164
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,742
JOHN: (AS WOMAN) You have to 
get out now. Please.

165
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,777
CONNOR: Come on.
Come on, birdie.

166
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,412
Please leave.

167
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,498
Connor, get ready
to close the door.

(LAUGHING)

170
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,593
.
I'm Connor Black

171
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,596
I'm senior political advisor to 
Senator Jackson Wyatt.

172
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,465
And we're here
to see Mr. Skillpa.

173
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,387
Fanny Crill.
Such a pleasure to
meet you, Mrs. Skillpa.

174
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,193
Well, I must say,
there could be less

175
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,196
odd circumstances
to get acquainted.

176
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,814
John's not here.

177
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,649
Fanny.

178
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,570
We're here because
of that monstrosity
in your backyard.

179
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,572
We want to do a rally
in your backyard

180
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,791
using the train as a backdrop.

181
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,293
What?

182
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,878
CONNOR: That train was
part of Senator Wyatt's

183
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,380
Whistle Stop campaign.

184
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,967
The challenger, Ted Johnson,
is a real mudslinger.

185
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,386
He wants to use
the train as a metaphor

186
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,506
for my boss' political career.

187
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,509
To be blunt,
I need you and
your husband's help.

188
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,317
Have you seen this picture?

189
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,488
CONNOR: Ted Johnson's
gonna use this photo
to hurt our campaign.

190
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,940
We're only three weeks
from election day,

191
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,909
and we can't let him
get away with it this time.

192
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,911
And Connor has
been kind enough

193
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,414
to allow me to
organize the event.

194
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,500
All of Peacock will be here.
Marching band, food.

195
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,202
What a very
special day it will be.

196
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,788
You and your husband
together with the Senator.

(SIGHS)

198
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,680
Connor, why don't you take that outside?

199
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,683
You don't mind if I
have a moment alone
with Mrs. Skillpa?

200
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,603
Sure, sure.
I don't have
anything better to do.

201
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,554

(SIGHING)

203
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,476
I knew I should've
come alone.

204
00:19:56,478 --> 00:20:00,899
You know,
I have always been so
curious about this house.

205
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,072
Well, have a seat.

206
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,375
(SIGHING)

207
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,213
How do you know John?

208
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,301
Well, my husband
owns the bank.
He's John's boss.

209
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,088
Ray's been
the Mayor of Peacock
for three terms now.

210
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,898
I guess this must all be just a 
tad overwhelming, Mrs. Skillpa.

211
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,183
Why don't you let me explain?

212
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,270
I run the county
shelter for women.

213
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,939
We mold the modern woman.
The woman who votes.

214
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,026
And Wyatt is viewed
as someone who's,

215
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:47,029
well, a little insensitive
to women's needs.

216
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,531
And so Connor had the idea
that we would get
a bunch of my girls

217
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,834
together with
the Senator and take a photo
and I've agreed to it.

218
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,838
But that oaf has no idea

219
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,176
that I plan to use the rally to raise 
money for my shelter.

220
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,180
Mrs. Crill, I need
to go upstairs.

221
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,049
Come on now.

222
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,720
Life doesn't begin
and end with housework,
and please call me Fanny.

223
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,724
Mrs. Skillpa,
this photo will help us
get donors for the shelter.

224
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,562
I don't know.

225
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:26,201
I know that the Skillpas
have a long history
of keeping to themselves.

226
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,037
But you're your own woman.

227
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,823
Remember that.

228
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,164
Oh. Okay, well,
it was a pleasure meeting you
and if you need anything,

229
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,501
just come out back
and we'll only
stay a few minutes.

232
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,032
I have to tell Wanda.

CONNOR:
What have you
got there?

234
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,588
Mrs. Skillpa,
how're you feeling?

235
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,089
You look so much better.

CONNOR: Careful.
Watch yourself.

238
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,594

FANNY: John should
really fix that step

239
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,095
Fanny?
FANNY: Yes?

240
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,597
When is the shelter
clothing drive this year?

241
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,599
It's closer
to Christmas.

242
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,352
Mrs. Skillpa,
I'm sure you know all about
Fanny's work at the shelter

243
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,937
with displaced
women and children.

244
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,889
Displaced children?

245
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,059
Well, we've been known
to help in
the adoption process.

246
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,644
Find good homes
for children.

247
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:45,814
.
Well, you should
come and meet some
of my girls sometime

248
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,449
So, where are your kids?

249
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,954
Well, Mr. Black,
I don't know how you
folks do it in Lincoln,

250
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,208
but in Peacock,
we don't pry.

251
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,212
I'd love to hear you
say yes to this rally.
If it's John,

252
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,215
only you know the
best way to get through
to your husband.

253
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,218
So get through.
Understand?

254
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,671
It's moments like this
modern women
take advantage of,

because it's
moments like this
that put us on the map.

isn't it, Johnny?

Who?
FANNY: Emma.

274
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,607
She's wonderful
and that house,

275
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,693
I can see
why your family
loved it so much.

Connor, why don't you
explain to John
our plan for the rally?

What we'd like to do is
hold a political rally
in your backyard

using the train
as a backdrop.

will be there.

Well, the train's
gonna be gone on Friday
'cause I spoke to Mr. Clap

and he said...
RAY: John.

Mr. Black out.

the boss of me!

Don't speak to
my wife that way

I...

290
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,064
You don't know
what you're doing.

291

Everything just
needs to get back
to how it was before.

292
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,072
Mr. Clapp promised the train
would be gone on Friday,

293
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,240
and that's what
needs to happen.

294
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,327
John, I spoke
to Albert Clapp
this morning.

295
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:46,912
The train's gonna be
there a while longer.

296

Well, it's my house.

297
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:52,000
And I don't know
what she told you.

298
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,837
.
I don't know
what she told you,
but she's not the boss of me

299
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:58,340
I make the decisions
, not Emma.

I'm the man of the house

the man of the
house, John.

Now, Mark Huggins
is coming to take that
train away on Friday,

303
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:09,517
and that's that.

304
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,942
Connor, why don't
you and I go
to Ray's office

305
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,911
and let him
speak to John alone?

RAY: John.

307

John, I wanna run
for Senate someday.

308
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,190
Now this could
really get me in
with the big guys, hmm?

309
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,063
I don't understand
how your wife can see

310
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,065
how big this is,
and you don't.

311
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,867
No one understands, sir.

312
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,953
John, I don't wanna hear 
another word out of you.

313
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,122
You need to sit here
and think about this.

314
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,626
I can't let her do this.

315
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:29,481
MAGGIE: John?

316
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,736
It's me.

317
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,862
Jake! Come back
to Mama right now.

318
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,671
Is anyone home?

319
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,374
What do you want?

320
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,546
There just isn't
any easy way
to say this, John.

321
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,266
Jake and me, we...

322
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,554
We're getting
out of this town.

323
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,442
I need your help.

324
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,530
What kind of help?

325
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,784
Money help.

326
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,205
It's been almost
a year now.

327
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,792
I've doubled up shifts
just to keep my place.

328
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,295
I don't know
what else to do.

329
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,800
I mean, I've been
planning on getting out
of here for a while now.

330
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,885
You know, saving and all.

331
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,886
Look, I know you've got...

332
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,888
Why are you
asking me for money?

333
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
The checks.

334
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,398
I haven't got a check
in a year now.

335
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,399
If I could just...

336
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,400
What checks?

337
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:58,987
(LAUGHS)

338
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,524
I wasn't sending
you any checks.

339
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:09,197
Your... Your mother was.

340
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,288
My mother died a year ago.

341
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,514
I didn't know that.

342
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,604
What were the checks for?

343
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,397
.
He's two now

344
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:52,207
I... I honestly
thought you knew.

345
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,494
Your mama was
sending me checks as
long as I stayed away.

346
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,549
John, please.
John, where are
you going?

347
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,470
I have my own money.

348
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:11,092
Don't go.

349
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:27,859
John, I really think...

350
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,032
Come here, honey.
I'm so sorry.

351
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,034
.
I didn't realize
anyone else was home

352
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,628
We better be going.
I'm so sorry.

353
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,770
What's his name?

354
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,641
Jake.

355
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,394
Who are you?

356
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,198
I'm Maggie.

357
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,703
.
Just an old friend of John's

358
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,823
Why are you here?

359
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:21,296
I read in the paper
about the train and all.

360
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,300
I just wanted to stop by
and make sure
everything was okay.

361
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,806
I better be going.

362
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,644
I'm Emma. John's wife.

363
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
Nice to meet you.

364
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,150
Good night.

365
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,414
EMMA: Maggie.

366
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,841
Where's your car?

367
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,346
.
I let a friend borrow it

368
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,848
Her aunt's real sick
in Lincoln,

369
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,850
so Jake and I
just been doing
a lot of walking.

370
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,474
You don't really
own a car, do you?

371
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,482
I don't mean
to pry or be rude,
but where's his bed?

372
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,209
Why don't you let me
drive you home?

373
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,213
That'd be real nice.

374
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,760
I'm sorry,
where's John?

375
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,846
Oh, he's sleeping.

376
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,442
You ready?

377
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,503
Do you...
Do you drive much?

378
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,457
You caught me.

379
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,428
You don't drive?

380
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,380
No.

381
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,467
Okay. You just
use one foot.

382
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,969
Don't put one on the gas
and one on the brake.

383
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:45,807
Just use one foot
to go back and forth.

384
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:47,058
All right.

385
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,226
Just like that.

386
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,311
Just easy.

387
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,229
All right.

388
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,797
I think you're
ready for the open road.

389
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,799
Thanks for
driving me
way out here.

390
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,303
I'm sorry if I
caused you any trouble.

391
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,305
You didn't,
you didn't.
Don't be silly.

392
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,809
Let me help you
into the house.

393
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,269
Have a seat.
I'll be right out.

394
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,355
Here you go, sweetie.

395
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,442
Good night, Jakey.

396
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,199
Would you like a drink?

397
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,202
Just a little something would 
be nice.

398
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,545
Do you like it here?

399
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,464

afford right now.

if you got a few minutes.

Not now, cupcake.
I got company.

Oh.

405
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,483
Okay.

406
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,985
Well, you know
where to find me.

407
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,805
Is that how you met John?

408
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,809
Emma, I'm sorry.

409
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,313
I'm so sorry.

410
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,271
It's okay.
It's okay, Maggie.

411
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:02,276
I just want... I just want
what's better for Jake.

412
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:05,279
You know what,
I went...

413
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,782
I went as long as I could
without that money.

414
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:14,288
What money?
Was John sending
you money?

415
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,293
His mother was.

416
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:23,297
Emma, it's bad.

417
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,301
It's really bad.

418
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:31,806
Please, I need to know.

419
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:38,813
I won't judge you.
Please believe me
when I say that.

420
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:42,817
Um,

421
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,819
I met his mother

422
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:52,326
three years ago in a bar
, and she paid me.

423
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,832
She said it was
just to meet John.

424
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:00,334
She brought me to that house.

425
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,837
and she brought me...

426
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,341
She brought me
up those stairs,

427
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:12,847
and I thought you were her.

428
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:16,350
She was wearing this o
ld blue and white dress.

of that bed.

wanna do any of it.

But I couldn't stop he

432
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:36,370
And she just
stayed in the room
the whole time.

433
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,874
And then I was
forced to stay.

434
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,377
I was so scared.

435
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:47,381
She made him do...

436
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:54,388
She made him do
horrible things.

437
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,864

come down for an interview
and fill out the forms.

So, John and I
would both have to
come in together?

00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,533
?
Yes. Is that a problem

447

Well, it's just that
with John's
work schedule and all...

I understand.
You also need references.
Yes.

I'd like to talk to Emma alone.

Maybe you could go
to the typing room

and try your hand at
that again. Thanks.

about the shelter.

What about John?

481

He put up quite a stink at the bank.

You spoke to John?

Yesterday, and he
would have none of it.

going to be huge news.

627
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,460
I know you have a lot going on,
but you or your wife

628
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,962
could pick up the phone.

00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,385
Okay, well,
look, train or no train,
this cannot happen again.

00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,836
WOMAN: Peacock State Bank.

632
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:32,255
You're going to have to skip lunch today.

633
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,341
WOMAN: Okay, sure.
Just one second.
EDMUND: Sit down

634
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:36,810
WOMAN: You have a phone call.
EDMUND: Who is it?

635
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,846
It's not for you, sir.
It's for John.

636
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:41,848
I think it's
your wife Emma.

637
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,531
Hello?

638
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:00,033
John, it's Maggie.

639
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:03,536
Why are you calling?

640
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:05,038
I really need to talk to you.

641

Where are you?

642
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,542
I'm at the women's shelter.

644

John, I really need

Yes, I...

648
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:21,554
You stay right there.
I'll come to you.

649

donate these, please.

And can you get
Maggie for me,
please?

Bring you here.

John. John, what's wrong?

660
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,885
I met Emma the night
I came to your house.

661
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,254
She gave Jake and me
a ride home.

662
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,590
I can't let her do this.

663
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,593
Maggie, you need to
stay away from Emma.

664
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,762
Emma's just trying
to help me and Jake.

665
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,348
I'll give you
the money
so you can leave.

666
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,354
Are you serious?

667
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:41,778
Yes. I need to
get you and Jake
out of Peacock.

668
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,531
It's not safe here for Jake.

669
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:55,875
.
Maggie, I can't go
back to that place

670
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,463
I'll give you
all the money,
all of it.

671
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:04,884
.
I've got $1,409.16

672
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:06,803
Emma doesn't know I have it.

673
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:10,056
It's at work.

674
01:00:10,056 --> 01:00:12,609
But what do you mean?
What place?

675
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,531
You don't understand.
I can't go back home.

676
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,534
I can't go back home.

677
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,290
John, I know you've
been through a lot
in that house,

678
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,047
but you gotta go home.
To Emma.

679
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:37,583
o?
Where do you want to g

680
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,086
o.
Where do you want to g
o? I'll take you
wherever you want to g

681
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:41,004
I'll take you.

682
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:46,426
I've got family
in Madison, but...

683
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:48,811
I'll take you there.

684
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,265
I'll give you the money
and I'll take you to Madison

685
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,350
I'll take you and Jake.

686
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,354
Okay.

687
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,158
Thank you.

688
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:22,211
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
for you and Emma.

689
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,215
She's not my wife.

690
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,278
John?

691
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,868
John, are you okay?

692
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,954
Please don't make me go.

693
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,339
I can't go home.

694
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,758
Are you hurt?

695
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,759
No.

696
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,961
Did you hurt somebody?

697
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:47,013
.
No, I swear I didn't

Emma?

701
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,550
No. When I was a kid.

702
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,552
Your mother?

703
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,478
She's not taking
care of me anymore.

704
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,902
And she would
have liked Emma.

705
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,987
Of course.
Yeah.

706
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,745
I met Emma
the day Mom died.

707

.
John. She's gone

708

.
You know that.
Your mom is gone

709
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,010
Okay, buddy.

710
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,513
I don't want
what happened to me

711
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,016
to happen to anyone else.

712
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:21,524
Okay, buddy, look.
We gotta get you
home, okay?

John, let's
get you home

714

I can't go.

stay out here.

No, you can't do
this to me, Emma.

You can't do this to me.

Good morning, ma'am. Is the man
of the house here?

727
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,209
Who're you?

728
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,794
I'm here about the train

729
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,796
What about it?

730
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,665
Your husband
hired me to remove it.

731
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,001
Did he?

732
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:39,722
You see your husband's name
at the bottom
of this contract?

Yes.
Do you see the $80

734
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,260
Well, as I said before,
my husband is not
here right now...

735
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:45,895
Is Maggie with you?

736
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,813
No. Why?

737
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,398
I'm gonna be back
here tomorrow, ma'am,

738
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,400
at 8:30 and you
better have that $800,

739
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,402
or you'll be
meeting my attorney.

740
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,440
What is that about?
Is everything all right?

741
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,109
Yes, everything's
fine. Why?

742
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,194
Glenda called me at home
and she said that.

743
01:08:02,194 --> 01:08:04,447
John took Maggie and Jake
yesterday

744
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:07,533
and they haven't come back.
Do you know anything about it?

No, I don't.

746
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,120
Well, one of the girls
said that

747
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,291
she seemed a little strange
like maybe she's lying.

748
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,209
I'll call Maggie at the trailer.

749

You don't mind?

750
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,212
No, I insist.

751
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,141
Why weren't you at the shelter
last night?

752
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,230
Emma, please don't be mad at me.

I just want to know
what's going on.

754

John came by the shelter
and he said he'd give me
what I asked for.

755
01:08:53,412 --> 01:08:54,747
The money?

756
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,553
And he'll drive to
my aunt's in Madison.

757
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,055
Well, he never
discussed this with me.

758
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,091
I'm sorry.

759

I didn't mean
to come between
you and John.

760
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,019
I always said
I'd take his help
if he offered it.

What?

01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:26,695
I just spoke to Fanny Crill

01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,198
about getting you
a job at the bank.

766
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,701
And it's a very
respectable position,

767
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:36,288
and obviously the pay
is a step in
the right direction.

768
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:42,211
And we can all stay together
and be here in Peacock.

Hi.

Excuse me, Mrs. Sternberg.
Good afternoon, John.

Why did you come
in the front door?

Emma told me how
neighborly you've been.
