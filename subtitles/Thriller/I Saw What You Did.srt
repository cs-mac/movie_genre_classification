Hi Lib.

What are you doing tonight?

Hmm, nothing, what
did you have in mind?

My mother and
father are going away.

How lucky can you get?

Overnight, they'll
be gone till tomorrow.

Are they leaving you alone?

13
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,501
Well no, they're getting
a babysitter for Tess,

15

Don't they trust you?

you know how parents are.

00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,049
Oh you do have
those numbers now?

169
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,759
Yes Mother, the
Wards and Dr. Sweeney.

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,343
Okay.

Oh all right, goodbye Kit.

Bye bye, have a good time.

It's so different, from

It's so big.

Come on, I wanna
show you my room.

Tess, you set the table.

Libby I wanna show her my room.

You can do that later,
set the table now.

Oh let her come,
Libby. Come on, Tess.

Oh I'll lend you

Do you have any

No.

Oh, Daddy was
supposed to fix this.

He probably did, but

I'd call her so she

505
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:52,412
I put it on the
man in the bathtub.

506
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,621
You what?

507
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,207
The man in the
bathtub remember?

508
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,543
He couldn't talk 'cause
he was taking a bath.

509
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:03,544
I put my sandwich down
then, on the phone book.

510
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,010
Steve, Steve Mara k!

511
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:15,935
Let's see if he's
still in the tub.

00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:30,154
Maybe he drowned!

515
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,459
Hey, I'm hungry, are you?

Steve.

Steve!

520
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:13,785
Steve?

521
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:20,583
I've been waiting for you.

522
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:25,584
Here, let me do that.

523
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,090
You shouldn't be alone,
especially tonight.

524
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:38,139
Come on in.

525
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:45,984
Your shoes are all muddy,
where have you been?

526
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:49,737
I had a flat, I
had to change it.

527
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:52,198
Well we're gonna get
those shoes right off.

528
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,908
Come on, let's sit down,
I'm gonna take care of you

529
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:55,285
whether you like or not.

530
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:57,245
Come on, take your shoes off.

531
00:31:57,246 --> 00:32:01,124
I'm giving the orders now.

532
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,002
I know what you need.

533
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:08,214
But first, I'm gonna give
you a nice stiff drink.

534
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:13,215
I'm gonna have one too.

535
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,313
I'll show you what it is
to be taken care of.

536
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:27,192
Let's drink to that first
night we had together.

537
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:31,070
I never knew anything
could be so wonderful.

538
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:36,071
Now we can drink to a whole
lifetime of nights like that.

539
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:40,580
You know Judith
was wrong for you.

540
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:42,499
She was too young, too
young to be a wife,

541
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,500
a companion or, ugh, anything.

542
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,051
I want you to relax.

543
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:55,345
We're gonna have
a beautiful life.

544
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:58,097
Just being together, that's
all that really matters.

545
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:01,935
We can go away,
anywhere we want.

546
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,811
Oh I need you Steve.

00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,898
Let it ring.

00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,734
You need me.

550
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:14,030
Let it ring!

551
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,573
Yes?

552
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:16,533
I sot him!

553
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:18,326
Well talk to him!

554
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:20,078
Is this Steve?

555
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,329
Steve Mara k?

556
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,582
That's right, who's this?

557
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:29,212
I saw what you did,
and I know who you are.

[mumbling]

560
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,012
What does he say?

561
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:42,141
He's playing along,
sounds exciting.

562
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:45,937
Yes, I know who you are,

563
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:49,190
and I saw what you did.

564
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,317
Who, who is this?

565
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,735
He wants to know who I am.

566
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:55,238
Oh make up a name,
make up a name.

567
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:57,448
Suzette.

568
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:57,993
Suzette?

569
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:06,916
Where are you calling from?

570
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,710
Where can I reach you?

571
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:10,128
What a swinger!

572
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,505
He wants a date?

573
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:16,009
Wouldn't you like to know?

574
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,135
Suzette?

00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,804
[giggling]

00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:20,349
Suzette!

Steve?

578
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,025
What is it?

579
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:35,695
What's wrong?

580
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:39,282
Just a business deal
I've been working on.

581
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:44,283
Look I may have to go out
later, you'd better go home.

582
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,623
No, Steve.

583
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:48,499
I'll wait, right here.

584
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,420
Please, Amy, I wanna be alone
till I can work this out.

585
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:53,755
Who is Suzette?

586
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:56,716
Get off my back, give
me room to breathe,

587
00:34:56,717 --> 00:35:00,178
you don't own me yet.

I'm sorry Steve, truly I am.

I can't help worrying,

590
00:35:05,142 --> 00:35:08,186
I just don't want to
see you hurt again.

591
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:10,897
There's nothing to worry about.

592
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:15,898
It's just a business deal
and Suzette's a part of it.

00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,155
Darling if you're in
trouble, I wanna help

home, I'll be over later.

Look I have money, lots of it!

It's ours now, we
can go away together,

please, please let me help.

00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:31,334
Amy, trust me.

We'll be together,
it'll work out that way,

Hello Suzette.

607
00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:56,984
Why did you hang
up on me before?

608
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:59,946
I've got to see you.

609
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:01,948
As soon as possible.

Hi Steve.

Suzette, I wanna meet you.

613
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,584
I wanna meet you too.

What a sex maniac!

615
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,046
He does want a date.

616
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,173
Anywhere you say.

617
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:23,970
Well, somewhere nice and quiet.

618
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:25,304
I know you realize
how important this is

619
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:29,183
to both of us.

620
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:34,184
It means everything to
me Suzette, everything.

621
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,940
I'll meet you anywhere,
at your home, at work.

622
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:45,032
I know you're smart, I know
you want the same things I do.

623
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,200
That's all that's
keeping me going,

624
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,954
nothing matters but seeing you.

625
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:54,250
You can trust me Suzette, I promise.

You'll be hearing
from me, goodbye now.

630
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:29,243
Wait a minute, please.

631
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,621
I'll call you back, I promise.

632
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:34,999
Then you will meet me?

633
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,544

Where can I reach you?

Oh didn't he sound exciting?

637
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:58,231
Yeah and sexy.

638
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,107
Well Why'd you hang up then?

639
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:03,611
Oh I can't meet him
Kit, you know that.

So what's the use?

Oh call him once more, please.

No, game's over.

00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:12,161
I wonder what he looks like.

644
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:13,538
We'll never know.

Libby!

00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:37,228
I had a bad dream, Libby.

650
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,105
Well, that's all
right, try to forget it.

651
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:41,774
I can't, it was horrible.

652
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:44,861
Try anyway, it
was just a dream.

653
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:48,114
All right, if you'll stay
here until I fall asleep.

654
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:50,741
Okay.

655
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:51,742
Libby?

00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:52,994
What?

657
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,246
If you did meet him,
what would you do?

658
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:58,040
I don't know, go for
a ride or something

659
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,458
or just talk.

660
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,168
About what?

661
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:04,130
Well, whatever he wanted to.

662
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:09,010
His work, girls he's
known, where he's been.

663
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:12,972
But what would you talk about?

664
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:16,809
Boys, where I've been.

665
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,020
Libby you haven't
been anywhere.

666
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:22,148
Well I went to New
York with Daddy once.

667
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:25,902
I guess I'd lie a little bit.

668
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:30,406
Well, what if he
didn't wanna just talk?

669
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:32,742
I'm not exactly a baby Kit.

00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,577
I can take care of myself.

671
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:36,495
Just by talking?

672
00:39:36,496 --> 00:39:39,749
Suppose that he
wanted to kiss you?

673
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,543
Well, maybe I'd let him.

674
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:46,088
Just once, or as
much as he wanted?

675
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:50,468
Well, I don't
know, he sounds nice.

676
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:53,512
His voice was so
deep, so exciting.

677
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:55,056
It was like he was
running his hand

678
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,099
down my back.

679
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,686
Real slowly...

680
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,438
Was it cold?

681
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:05,691
That's a silly question.

682
00:40:05,692 --> 00:40:06,943
I'll tell you what
would happen if you

683
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:08,319
really did meet him.

684
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,280
He'd take one look at you
and send you straight home.

685
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:14,408
Anyway he's probably married.

686
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,662
Oh Kit, you're so naive.

687
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:20,998
Just because a man's married...

688
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:25,127
I just wish I knew
what he looked like.

689
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:28,047
Kit, if we could find out.

690
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:29,048
Tess are you asleep?

691
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:31,217
Sure I'm asleep.

692
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:33,344
We could meet him Kit,
well see him I mean,

693
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,012
without him seeing us.

694
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:36,681
I don't know what you mean.

695
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:38,599
Well we know where he lives,

696
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,226
I could take Mommy's car.

697
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:41,894
I've got my learner's permit.

698
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:43,229
Libby Mannering!

699
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,147
You wouldn't dare!

700
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:49,735
I will if you will.

701
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,488
We could park near
his house and see him.

702
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,408
You're not leaving
me alone, Lib.

703
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:58,119
Ah, well I thought
you were asleep.

704
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,913
I was.

705
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:03,165
I can't leave Tess, Kit.

706
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,001
Well I'd stay with her.

707
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:09,755
No, she's my responsibility.

708
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:14,756
I just couldn't leave her.

709
00:41:15,012 --> 00:41:17,596
Well our problem is
about the same, Tom,

710
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:19,432
trying to convert to
computers without violating

711
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:20,933
the union contracts.

712
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:22,476
Well I'm seeing Roy
Miller next week

713
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:24,020
to go over some of the figures.

714
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:26,063
David?

715
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,940
David there's no answer at home.

716
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:29,150
Well there must be.

717
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:31,068
But I've tried three
times in the last 10 minutes

718
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:33,487
the phone rings but
there's no answer.

719
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:35,114
And you're sure you've
got the right number?

720
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,033
Well of course I had
the operator check it.

721
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:39,118
Well maybe they've got
the TV turned way up.

722
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,412
The phone's in the same
room, they'd hear it if

723
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:42,747
they were there.

724
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:44,415
Now calm down honey,
maybe they're out

725
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,042
saying good night to Carmen.

726
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:47,334
That's our goat.

727
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:48,669
Or taking a look at the
moon or they're up

728
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,629
in their room playing records.

729
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,299
Now relax, what could be wrong?

730
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,300
I don't know, I just wish
we hadn't left them alone.

731
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,430
[frolicking music]

732
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:06,187
Number one, we don't
get out of the car.

733
00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:09,106
Number two, we stay
just 10 minutes.

734
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,941
Well if that's
all we're gonna do,

735
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,194
what did you put on
your best dress for?

736
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:15,196
And all that make-up?

737
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:17,198
Just in case!

738
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,075
Suppose he doesn't come out?

739
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:21,452
It doesn't matter,
now remember,

740
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:23,996
nobody gets out of this
car, is that understood?

741
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:28,997
[frolicking music]

742
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:32,505
[giggling]

743
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:37,506
There it is Lib, stop!

744
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:42,014
Lib turn out the lights.

745
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:45,476
Be quiet!

746
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:47,895
It kinda looks like
him, doesn't it?

747
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:50,022
Like he sounds I mean.

748
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:53,025
Sort of mysterious.

749
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:55,402
Oh Lib there's no reason
for him to come out.

750
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:58,114
He's probably in bed by now.

751
00:42:58,115 --> 00:43:00,533
Well, maybe he's got a dog.

752
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,368
He might have to
take it for a walk.

753
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,205
Oh this is silly Lib,
let's go home please.

754
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,624
We just got here.

755
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,459
He's probably
sitting there, reading,

756
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,920
or watching TV.

757
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:14,380
If I honk I bet he'd hear it!

758
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:16,006
Well don't!

759
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,300
Look we can come
back in the daytime,

760
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:23,301
let's go home now, please!

761
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:28,853
If we don't see him
tonight, we never will.

762
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:31,188
Oh Lib, you said you
wouldn't get out of the car.

763
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:33,691
I'm just gonna
walk past his house.

764
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:36,861
Oh Lib please don't go!

765
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:40,072
Lib, come back Lib!

766
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:45,073
Please, Libby!

767
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:54,170
Go get her Kit,
make her come back!

768
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:57,882
Oh that's all right Tess,
nothing to worry about.

769
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:02,883

[foreboding music]

772
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,194
She's gone Kit,
I can't see her.

[screaming]

You little tramp!

776
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,995
Throwing yourself
at him, chasing him.

777
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:34,621
I don't even know him!

778
00:46:34,622 --> 00:46:36,332
Get outta here!

779
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,709
You're a liar, I heard
you on the telephone.

780
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,085
Now get outta here!

781
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:42,421
Please, we didn't mean
to cause any trouble,

782
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:43,630
it was just a game.

783
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,049
I know what kind of a game,

784
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,509
with a man over twice your age.

785
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,386
Now get outta here!

786
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:50,679
Somebody's coming!

787
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,306
Mrs. Marak please,
you don't understand!

788
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:53,599
You little tramp!

789
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,059
They caught Libby,
get back Tess, quick!

790
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,144
Please, let me explain!

791
00:46:57,145 --> 00:47:00,939
Get outta here, go!

792
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,109
Look, just a minute, if
you ever try to see him

793
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,027
or call him again...

794
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:06,195
I won't, I promise I won't!

795
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:08,864
You'd better promise,
now get in there!

796
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:09,365
Go on!

797
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,247
[foreboding music]

00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:20,209
Oh no, no please
don't take that.

799
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,380
Go on home!

800
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:27,925
Look honey.

801
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:30,135
You're too young.

802

[door slamming shut]

803
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,515

00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,971
I met your little
business deal, Steve.

808
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:15,139
Suzette.

809
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,056
What did she tell you?

810
00:48:16,057 --> 00:48:18,392
She lied of course.

811
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:21,645
Another childish,
empty-headed, little tramp.

812
00:48:21,646 --> 00:48:23,647
Your taste is sickening.

813
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:28,110
She even lied about her name.

814
00:48:28,111 --> 00:48:30,070
Ellie Mannering.

815
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,073
Keep it, as a souvenir.

816
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:36,702
Just a reminder that this
is your last Suzette.

817
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:38,787
And it is your last one,
get that through your

818
00:48:38,788 --> 00:48:40,038
head right now.

819
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,039
Look I don't need
you to plan my life

820
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,666
or to give me orders,
you wanna crack a whip,

821
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,876
get yourself a dog.

822
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,794
Oh but the orders
are just starting.

823
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:47,087
We're gonna get married, go away

824
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,089
and do exactly what
you said, be together.

825
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,799
You're crowding me again Amy.

826
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,928
I got things to do.

827
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:58,098
Sure you have things to do.

828
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,350
With Suzette.

829
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:02,019
I heard you on the
phone with her.

830
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,605
I listened in the bedroom.

831

I also know what
happened here tonight

It's a simple choice, Steve.

834
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:20,329
Life with me or no life at all.

835
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,581
You're blackmailing
me into marrying you.

836
00:49:22,582 --> 00:49:23,999
You must want it awful
bad, the ring with

837
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,876
the Mrs. in front of your name.

838
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:29,630
But only with you.

839
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:32,090
What you're saying
is I have no choice.

840
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:34,510
None at all.

841
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:35,844
Very simple, all I have to do

842
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:40,845
is pick up the phone
and call the police.

843
00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:45,896
Well Amy, maybe it'll work.

844
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:49,733
Who knows, you might
be just what I needed.

845
00:49:49,734 --> 00:49:54,734
How about a drink
huh? I can use one.

846
00:49:57,867 --> 00:49:59,576
It'll work.

847
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:04,039
Maybe not at first,
but it will work.

848
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,250
A little ice.

849
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,501
Steve.

850
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:09,086
Yeah?

851
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:11,755
Please try to understand.

852
00:50:11,756 --> 00:50:13,799
I had to do it this way.

853
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,800
[foreboding music]

854
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:01,013
What'll we drink to?

855
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,223
How about uh, to us?

856
00:51:03,224 --> 00:51:04,349
Okay, to us.

857
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:09,350
[glasses clinging]

858
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,480
[romantic music]

859
00:51:25,705 --> 00:51:30,705
[sudden music]

860
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:42,425
[whimpering]

861
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:47,937
Steve...

862
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,736
Oh I told you we
shouldn't have come.

863
00:51:57,737 --> 00:51:59,279
Who was she, Lib?

864
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,448
Mrs. Marak.

865
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:03,950
I've just got to
get it from her.

866
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:05,285
What Lib?

867
00:52:05,286 --> 00:52:09,122
She took Mommy's
registration card.

868
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:10,540
Maybe if we went back,

869
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,125
but explained it was all a joke?

870
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:13,710
Oh we're in enough trouble.

871
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:18,711
If you go back I'm getting
out of this car now.

872
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:25,555
[phone ringing]

873
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:27,099
Hello, Sgt. Harris.

874
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,143
Oh Sgt. Harris, this
is David Mannering.

875
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:32,187
The Mr. Mannering
in Oakland Hills?

876
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:34,147
Yes that's right,
on Woodbridge Road.

877
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:36,650
I've been calling my
house for almost an hour

878
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:39,444
now my children are there
alone and there's no answer.

879
00:52:39,445 --> 00:52:41,238
Well where are
you calling from?

880
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:43,240
Well I'm in Santa Barbara,
90 miles from the house.

881
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:44,950
Could the phone
be out of order?

882
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:47,202
No, no I had the
operator check the number.

883
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:49,746
I wonder if you could
send a car out there?

884
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:52,290
Well yes, but could
they just be asleep?

885
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:54,292
Well of course
they might be asleep

886
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:57,170
or playing outside, but
I'd certainly appreciate it

887
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,714
if you'd check.

888
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:00,924
I'll send a car out
right away, Mr. Mannering.

889
00:53:00,925 --> 00:53:02,634
Oh thank you
Sergeant, thank you.

890
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:06,263
Yes we'll be at
Santa Barbara 5930.

891
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,597
And will you call us back here?

892
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:09,683
5930, yes sir.

893
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:12,769
Thank you very much.

894
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,272
David let's go home, now.

895
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:17,232
Well look honey,
everything's probably fine.

896
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:18,525
There's no point in leaving now,

897
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:23,526
not until we hear
from the police.

898
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:47,053
You're gonna catch it when
Mommy and Daddy get home!

899
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:50,640
Tess Mannering if you say
one word, just one word!

900
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:55,641
She won't have to, they'll
know we were out in the car.

901
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,444
Oh Libby what are we gonna do.

902
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,029
Oh I wish I knew.

903
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,238
You're gonna catch it!

904
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:08,742
I know one thing,
you're going to bed, now!

905
00:54:08,743 --> 00:54:11,203
But suppose I have
another bad dream!

906
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:12,537
That's your problem.

907
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:14,414
You're gonna catch it anyway.

908
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:18,794
And you better take all that
stuff off your face too!

909
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,420
Oh Lib if my dad
finds out he'll never

910
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:22,172
let me come here again.

911
00:54:22,173 --> 00:54:24,049
You know how strict he is.

912
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:27,344
If my parents find out,
that's the end of the car.

913
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:29,638
And I'll be grounded for years.

914
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,140
Libby you've got to get
it, you've just got to!

915
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:34,476
Well I wanted to go back,
but who chickened out?

916
00:54:34,477 --> 00:54:36,686
Yeah but who got
us into this mess?

917
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:39,189
And remember, we'd
just stay five minutes,

918
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,732
and nobody gets out of the car.

919
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:42,025
Then you got out!

920
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,693
How did I know his
wife would be there?

921
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:45,612
I told you he was
probably married.

922
00:54:45,613 --> 00:54:47,489
Shouldn't have gotten
out in the first place.

923
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:51,284
[phone ringing]

924
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:52,786
Hello?

925
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:54,412
Is Mr. Mannering there?

926
00:54:54,413 --> 00:54:56,206
No he's not.

927
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,041
Is Mrs. Mannering there?

928
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,417
Are you Mrs. Mannering?

929
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:00,836
No, she's gone too.

930
00:55:00,837 --> 00:55:02,879
This is his daughter.

931
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,131
Well when will
your parents be back?

932
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:08,093
Not till tomorrow morning,
can I take a message?

933
00:55:08,094 --> 00:55:10,679
No, just tell them
Mr. Jackson called,

934
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,430
it's a business matter.

935
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:15,475
Good night.

936
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:20,476
[foreboding music]

937
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:53,843
Tess, Tess?

938
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,683
Did you take that pill?

939
00:55:56,684 --> 00:55:57,559
Libby?

940
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,852
What?

941
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,562
How are you gonna get
the registration card?

942
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:04,065
I don't know, maybe I can
call Mrs. Marak in the morning.

943
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:06,401
Get up before my
parents come home.

944
00:56:06,402 --> 00:56:07,485
You've got to Libby!

945
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:10,196
I know, I know, stop worrying.

946
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,781
Tess?

947
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:16,782
Oh where is she?

948
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,711
Tess?

[foreboding music]

950
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:34,596
Tess, are you hiding in there?

[foreboding music]

952
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:47,025
Kit, Tess is gone!

953
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:48,068
Gone where?

954
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:53,069
I don't know, come on,
we've gotta find her.

955
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:57,035
Oh Libby do we
have to go outside?

956
00:56:57,036 --> 00:56:59,245
She's not in the house.

957

[dog barking]

958
00:57:01,624 --> 00:57:04,334
Now he's gone.

959
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:07,379
Tess?

960
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,255
Tess!

961
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:11,216
Tess, are you out there?

962
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:14,177
Come in the house this minute.

963
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:16,554
Come on.

00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:21,555
[dog barking]

965
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:23,645
Libby she wouldn't go this far.

966
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:28,525
That idiot would go anywhere.

967
00:57:28,526 --> 00:57:30,193
Oh that little fool.

968
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,237
Oh when I get my hands on her.

[goat bleating]

970
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:36,116
Tess?

971
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:37,367
Tess!

972
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:39,577
Oh I bet she's in here.

973

[rumbling]

974
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:50,964
Tess.

975
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:53,842
Tess Mannering what
are you doing in here?

976
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:57,178
I couldn't sleep, I
had another bad dream.

977
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,264
Well why didn't you tell me.

978
00:57:59,265 --> 00:58:02,892
It's my problem, you said so.

979
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:05,770
Anyway Gypsy couldn't
sleep either.

980
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:09,149
Oh Libby, let's go back.

981
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,192
Another thing, I was locked in,

982
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:13,069
couldn't open the door.

983

[door slamming shut]

984
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,947
Oh Libby!

[screaming]

987
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:31,963
Relax, relax, relax.

988
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:34,799
Well, no wonder your
folks couldn't find you,

989
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,092
have you been out
here all night?

990
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,927
No we went out in Mommy's car.

991
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:40,180
Yes, with Gypsy.

992
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:42,640
That's our pony.

993
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:47,062
Okay, come on, let's
get back to the house.

994
00:58:47,063 --> 00:58:48,063
You're gonna have to
phone your parents,

995
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:50,106
they're worried
stiff, come on honey.

996
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:52,233

as young and attractive,
was brutally,

in the rocky ground.

Prompted by what she
described as a hunch,

Ms. Carson reported the
incident to the police.

Carson's description,

01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:49,330
I don't know.

1163
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:51,791
The registration.

1164
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,626
I bet he got it from his wife.

1165
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:55,086
He probably knew how
much trouble we'd be in

1166
01:08:55,087 --> 01:09:00,049
without it.

1167
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:02,134
No, now you stay here.

1168
01:09:02,135 --> 01:09:05,680
Can't I look at him from
the top of the stairs?

1169
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:09,767
Well, all right.

1172
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:44,548
Steve, are you in here?

1173
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:07,075
Steve?

1174
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,040
Steve, where are you?

1175
01:10:30,432 --> 01:10:35,432
Mr. Marak are you out there?

[screaming] [sudden music]

1177
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:58,167
You're not Suzette.

1178
01:10:58,168 --> 01:11:01,420
You're just a kid.

1179
01:11:01,421 --> 01:11:03,255
Where is she?

1180
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:06,842
Mr. Marak, I
pretended to be Suzette.

1181
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:09,303
I'm Libby Mannering.

1182
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:10,846
You pretended?

1183
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,807
It was a game, we called people

1184
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:17,808
on the telephone just for fun.

1185
01:11:18,021 --> 01:11:20,105
Steve?

1186
01:11:20,106 --> 01:11:23,609
This is Suzette, I
saw what you did,

1187
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,862
and I know who you are.

1188
01:11:26,863 --> 01:11:31,863
It was just a game.

1189
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,997
You said you saw what
I did, what did you see?

1190
01:11:36,998 --> 01:11:39,333
Nothing, nothing.

1191
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:42,628
That was just part of the game.

1192
01:11:42,629 --> 01:11:43,879
But you knew who I was,

1193
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,464
knew my name, how
did you find that?

1194
01:11:45,465 --> 01:11:49,051
Well in the telephone book.

1195
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:52,137
We just picked any name.

1196
01:11:52,138 --> 01:11:54,056
I put peanut butter
and jelly on it,

1197
01:11:54,057 --> 01:11:55,891
that's how we found it.

1198
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:58,310
We called lots of
other people too.

1199
01:11:58,311 --> 01:12:01,021
We said the same
thing to all of them.

1200
01:12:01,022 --> 01:12:05,568
I'm really sorry Mr. Marak,
we shouldn't have done it.

1201
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:06,944
But I tried to
explain to your wife

1202
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,196
that it was just a joke.

1203
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:13,617
Did she give you the
registration card?

1204
01:12:13,618 --> 01:12:15,661
You know what I should do?

1205
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,121
Tell your parents.

1206
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:18,998
Oh no, no please,

1207
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:22,543
please don't do that.

1208
01:12:22,544 --> 01:12:25,462
You must want
this awful bad huh?

1209
01:12:25,463 --> 01:12:27,506
Oh I sure do.

1210
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:30,551
You don't know what a mess
I'll be in if I don't get it.

1211
01:12:30,552 --> 01:12:33,554
My wife was pretty upset.

1212
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:36,056
I'm really sorry.

1213
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:39,810
It's all right,
I calmed her down.

1214
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:41,270
Well there's no use
making a federal case

1215

out of a silly prank, hmm?

Here.

1217
01:12:47,736 --> 01:12:50,070
Oh, just one thing,

1218
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:53,741
don't use the phone for
fun and games anymore.

Libby?

1224
01:13:07,255 --> 01:13:09,965
Kit, you'll never guess.

1225
01:13:09,966 --> 01:13:12,343
I told you everything
would be all right.

1226
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:15,346
You see, all your
worrying was for nothing.

1227
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:18,182
I hate to say I told you so.

1228
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:23,183
I've got it, Mommy's
registration card.

1229
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:30,861
No he brought it here.

1230
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:32,321
Steve Marak was there?

1231
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:33,572
Mm-hmm!

1232
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:35,282
He didn't want us to
get in any trouble.

1233
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:37,826
Oh thank goodness,
is he still there?

1234
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,996
No he's gone, but
he sure had me scared.

1235
01:13:40,997 --> 01:13:42,373
I would've been scared too,

1236
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:44,375
[sighs] what did he look like?

1237
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:49,376
Well he was kinda tall.

1238
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,300
He had brown hair.

1239
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:56,512
He was older than we
thought, about 40.

1240
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:58,764
Oh Libby this is real weird.

Wait till I tell you,

1242
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:02,643
a woman was murdered tonight,
I heard it on the radio,

1243
01:14:02,644 --> 01:14:04,687
some girl saw the
man who did it,

1244
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:07,564
she saw the murderer
Libby, and he was tall,

and I know who you are.

calling, isn't that
