1
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:29,008
<i> It is me. Joe. </i>

2
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:39,758
<i> And it is Piggy. </i>

3
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,258
<i> Piggy was an Avenger. </i>

4
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,842
<i> He arranged things I could not. </i>
<i> He changed everything. </i>

5
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:57,758
<i> Piggys philosophy and his self-confidence </i>
<i> gave me strength. </i>

6
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,883
<i> He gave me his version of freedom. </i>

7
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,175
<i> To tell me I must </i>
<i> talk about Piggy, and all the violence. </i>

8
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:26,508
<i> And how </i>
<i> I was part of it. </i>

9
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:42,050
A YEAR EARLIER

10
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:49,883
<i> At the beginning of the year I </i>
<i> work as a messenger. </i>

11
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,092
<i> I went with </i>
<i> packages, letters ... everything. </i>

12
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,883
<i> What was now needed. </i>

13
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,175
<i> It was my first job </i>
<i> for several years. </i>

14
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,842
<i> I had been too shy </i>
<i> to work. </i>

15
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:31,008
- <i> I would not at home. </i>
- <i> You full on Friday? </i>

16
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,883
- No.
- Well ... He baked in the thick girl.

17
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,967
- No.
- And you actually spoke with people.

18
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,883
<i> It was not </i>
<i> a good job for me. </i>

19
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,342
<i> It was hard </i>
<i> to be so close to the other. </i>

20
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,842
<i> And the longer I was with them, </i>
<i> the less with I felt. </i>

21
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:11,883
<i> Maybe we feel all such </i>
<i> of time. </i>

22
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:25,717
<i> So I thought about possible dangers </i>
<i> in most situations. </i>

23
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:02,383
- Delivery.
- Thank you! And your name is?

24
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,175
Sorry! Sorry!

25
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:16,717
<i> Otherwise it was day one. </i>

26
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,800
<i> But they felt a little different. </i>

27
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:24,175
<i> I stared at the thing, </i>
<i> I could not get. </i>

28
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:28,592
<i> Tried to sleep all night. </i>

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,967
<i> It was pretty much my life. </i>

30
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:35,800
<i> Every day, almost the same. </i>

31
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,675
<i> floor at work. Work. </i>
<i> Become numb. Try to sleep. </i>

32
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:49,508
<i> floor at work. Work. </i>
<i> Become numb. Try to sleep. </i>

33
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:52,217
- How are you?
- Extra lock? As a grandmother. As a woman.

34
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,717
- Come in.
- Okay, little brother.

35
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:08,758
- The paintings are horrible.
- They were here when I moved into.

36
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:13,425
- I did not think about it.
- It's a little weird.

37
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:19,883
Give me a hug.

38
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,967
You are a poor little thing, huh?

39
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,008
- Here.
- Thank you.

40
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:32,050
- It has always been.
- I just want to be alone.

41
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:36,467
Will you be here for a while?

42
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,925
- I sent my stuff back here.
- Fine.

43
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:44,258
- Would you pay a visit to Claire?
- Yes.

44
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,717
- Do you?
- What?

45
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:51,300
- You have a crush on her.
- No! I do not want your old.

46
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:54,633
It's an eternity ago.

47
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:58,133
I'm kidding.
You have no chance.

48
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,717
Is it yours?

49
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,675
Yes. It was not expensive.

50
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,508
- Let me see.
- No, come on.

51
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,258
Shut up.

52
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,508
We shall see.

53
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:25,258
I look okay.
You look like an idiot.

54
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:27,633
What are you doing these days?

55
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,842
What are you doing these days?

56
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:33,883
I'm waiting ... to determine the me.

57
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:37,675
So you fumble around?

58
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:43,425
You have to do something. Aiming at something.
You can do better. Right?

59
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:48,883
When you were interested in something
as small, threw you feel about it.

60
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,883
- You seem delusional.
- There something pops up.

61
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,592
- Jaså?
- Yes! Do not worry.

62
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,633
But I am.

63
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,842
- What is it?
- Just some fools.

64
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,633
One of the reasons why
I hate London.

65
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:16,425
- Come on. Say hello. Hey.
- Shut up.

66
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:19,217
Hey. I love you.

67
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:23,467
- Do not look, they can come over here.
- Hell with them.

68
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,300
- Hello!
- Hello!

69
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,467
Oh, it was lovely.

70
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,342
- Hi there!
- Hello.

71
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,217
So, that's enough. Dry white wine?

72
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,550
Yes. That sounds good.

73
00:08:55,342 --> 00:09:00,092
<i> year seemed to be better </i>
<i> from then on. </i>

74
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,508
<i> Everything was just as linked. </i>

75
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:34,842
Marco! This is my little brother.

76
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,050
My little brother Joe. Jeff.

77
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,508
- Hey, buddy!
- Yes?

78
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,217
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

79
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,800
Give me your money, dude.
Otherwise you will die, okay?

80
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,758
Hurry up, dammit!

81
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,050
Sorry.

82
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,342
- I know you.
- What? What?

83
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:33,967
Son of a bitch.

84
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:31,758
Hi there. It goes fine.
We're going out tonight, close to you.

85
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,217
- No, forget it.
- No excuses.

86
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:40,883
- You have not been in town long.
- I just do not want.

87
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:45,008
- You owe me 50 pounds.
- I do not have 50 pounds.

88
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:48,717
I'm kidding. I just want to be seen.

89
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:53,092
When?

90
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:59,258
When I saw "the world's largest burger"
on the menu, I thought "yes, yes".

91
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:05,717
There were three steaks,
and bacon, ham, eggs.

92
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,717
There were a hundred things in it!

93
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:14,342
He presses burger down like this.
So he can get it into his mouth.

94
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,300
"You must take it apart."
"Oh no!"

95
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:21,550
Then he opened his mouth up.

96
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,800
Pushed inside.

97
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:28,092
There is a cocktail stick
in the middle of the burger.

98
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,675
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down, fool.

99
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:33,883
- See how you go, buddy.
- Dude?

100
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,883
What the hell is that? Blackcurrant Juice?

101
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,508
You want something,
matching blouse?

102
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,717
Hello!

103
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:48,717
- Flat now down your pussy!
- Go to your friends. Go on.

104
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,342
You're on thin ice.

105
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,842
It's okay. I am calm.

106
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:59,175
- Try, when you feel strong.
- Shut up!

107
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:02,425
Go to hell!

108
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,175
- Crush him, mate.
- It's okay.

109
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:09,883
Damn ... You know what?

110
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:18,925
Fucking idiot. There is always
fools here. What do you do?

111
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,842
- Easy.
- You were lucky.

112
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:25,883
Let it go, John.

113
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,508
Shock.

114
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:41,175
- What was that a shock?
- Shut up.

115
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,883
- Slightly.
- We're over here!

116
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,925
- Jamie! Would you like?
- The second time applies.

117
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,217
The smile I recognize!

118
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:02,175
Damn it!

119
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:11,800
Jamie, relax now.
You do not need beatings or anything.

120
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:18,842
- I'm going home.
- Already?

121
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:23,342
- I'm just tired.
- I play against you next time.

122
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,883
- John. I'm out of here.
- Do not worry about the type.

123
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,467
They will through me
to reach you.

124
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:34,925
I'm just tired. Long days.

125
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,342
Okay. Come here.

126
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,592
Call us next week.

127
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,383
You can ask me out,
you owe me the money.

128
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:49,717
Now he sticks out!

129
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:54,050
I can not take much more
the crap here.

130
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,342
Hello?

131
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,508
What?

132
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,717
When?

133
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,842
Hey. John Burgess, came in this morning.

134
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:59,508
- I'm his brother.
- Burgess? Ground 5th To the right.

135
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,342
Claire.

136
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,050
It is very bad.

137
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:22,550
You, do you remember me?

138
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,883
What? Do you remember me?
Møgfisse!

139
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,258
Do you remember me, your pussy?

140
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:40,217
You're dead!

141
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:45,050
Damn! Fucking ...

142
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,758
Pussy!

143
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,383
Pivskid!

144
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,217
Nurse!
Nurse!

145
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:26,883
<i> There were people enough to </i>
<i> justify a ufuldbyrdet life. </i>

146
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:35,258
<i> It is always good </i>
<i> to make the family proud. </i>

147
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,758
<i> have something to hold on to </i>
<i> on days like this. </i>

148
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:43,842
<i> the morning I smoked grass </i>
<i> and got drunk. </i>

149
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:47,008
<i> Almost forgot </i>
<i> everything about that day. </i>

150
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:17,175
<i> The days flowed like just together. </i>

151
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:20,175
<i> Life just kinda happened. </i>

152
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:30,550
<i> Nothing mattered, </i>
<i> for nothing stood out. </i>

153
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:37,467
<i> It was like trying to see </i>
<i> with a spotlight in the eyes. </i>

154
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:54,092
<i> My best friend was gone. Where </i>
<i> was I who should I charge? </i>

155
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,883
<i> How could I punish </i>
<i> them for what they had taken from me? </i>

156
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:05,883
But one thing I knew.

157
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,925
<i> To those who murdered John, </i>
<i> not have been afraid. </i>

158
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,883
<i> But it should have been. </i>

159
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Hey, buddy. Is everything all right?

160
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:42,675
Yes.

161
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,675
- Do I know you?
- Yes.

162
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,550
When you were little,
I knew your brother.

163
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:52,008
Okay.

164
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:59,842
Do you have some spare time?
I will talk to you.

165
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:22,133
The security above all. It's good.

166
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:41,925
I like it here, Joe.
Fucking ... cozy and such.

167
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,675
Domestically.

168
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:50,592
- What do you want?
- I read what has happened.

169
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,050
It was terrible.
Awful.

170
00:24:56,467 --> 00:25:02,425
- How did you know about me?
- I and John were old friends.

171
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,633
We went to school together.

172
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,425
Yes, I think I recognize you.

173
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,508
I ...

174
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,383
- I read about what has happened.
- Is that why you are here?

175
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,967
Yes ... Yes.

176
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,883
See.

177
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,258
Fine.

178
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:44,717
Who are you?

179
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:47,508
I'm Piggy, Joe.

180
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:51,342
You can call me Piggy. It makes all.

181
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:57,675
Yes. I think I remember you
from when I was a child.

182
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,883
May I sit down?

183
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,383
Rar.

184
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:16,258
It was horrible.

185
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:19,217
Yes.

186
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,133
You know, it just feels ...

187
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:29,800
It feels as if there never
something is done about it.

188
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,842
- Yes.
- That's right.

189
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:40,050
Someone should do something about it, Joe.

190
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,258
- Yes.
- And you must be angry.

191
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:49,217
- I am.
- I would be damned angry.

192
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,050
It's horrible.

193
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:58,800
Awful.

194
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,550
- Your own brother.
- Yes.

195
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:06,217
I mean ... Your own flesh and blood.

196
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:10,050
Your brother, Joe.

197
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:13,508
When these things happen ...

198
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:20,050
... Do not have anything.
- How does it feel. That's it.

199
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,467
If you do not do anything.

200
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:29,008
Yes.

201
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:37,050
It's really terrible,
it happened.

202
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:56,175
But I'm glad I came.
It was great to see you again.

203
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,883
- Yes, that was it.
- See you again, right?

204
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:03,883
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

205
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:08,633
I trades always around.
I can look into, say hi.

206
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,883
I'll see myself out.

207
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:23,133
<i> I dreamed about Piggy. </i>

208
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:26,675
<i> At work </i>
<i> I thought about him all day. </i>

209
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:32,633
<i> Where I had seen him before. </i>
<i> Where he came from. </i>

210
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:37,675
<i> I met him more and more often. </i>

211
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:42,967
<i> I told everything that had happened. </i>
<i> He would help me. </i>

212
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:48,883
<i> It was nice that someone said, </i>
<i> that he loved me. </i>

213
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,175
- I bought something for you.
- Why?

214
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:58,717
- It can cheer you up.
- Jaså?

215
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:01,883
- It makes you happy.
- What is it?

216
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,383
I know how happy
you are cooking.

217
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:09,217
- You do well to cook?
- Of course.

218
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:13,967
See here. Look at that bastard.

219
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:22,550
- You enjoy cooking, right?
- Yes.

220
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:26,383
- And then you have to use a sharp knife.
- Yes.

221
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:29,008
- Right?
- Yes.

222
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:34,675
- Thank you. It was nice of you.
- You're welcome. I enjoyed it.

223
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:45,467
The ones I talk about Joe ...

224
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:52,592
It's the good, like you and me.

225
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,758
Or the evil. The vicious.

226
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:01,550
The monsters, Joe.

227
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:07,967
But you have to drop the fear, mate.

228
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:12,550
You can make the world
to submit to your will.

229
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:15,425
Whatever it is.

230
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,675
Using lies. Using violence.

231
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,508
Use whatever.

232
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:25,425
My old grandmother always said:

233
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:30,050
"If you can not get something, boy ...
so take it, damn it. "

234
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:39,550
Trust me, Joe.
I will help you.

235
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:43,300
Why would you help me?

236
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:48,300
Because I loved your brother.
I loved him, Joe.

237
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:51,883
And I know those people.

238
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:56,425
You would like my help, Joe?

239
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,925
You would suppose that I help you?

240
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,217
Yes.

241
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:06,425
Yes.

242
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:10,300
Okay. We go out.

243
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,633
Apart? Now?

244
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:18,550
Out. Now.

245
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,467
You and me.

246
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:24,467
I have something for you, Joe.

247
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,967
Something I will show you.

248
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:32,592
You'll like it here.
It is a gift more.

249
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,258
Can you see it now?

250
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:06,883
Do you remember him?

251
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:12,050
Yes.

252
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,258
Come!

253
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:24,217
Do nothing. Say nothing.

254
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,967
Follow me.

255
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:50,842
Hello!

256
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:54,883
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb your evening stroll.

257
00:33:55,758 --> 00:33:58,550
- Do you know him?
- Who the hell are you?

258
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:02,383
No, you know him. Look closely.

259
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:07,758
You know him for sure!
Look closely.

260
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:10,717
You know him.

261
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:34,883
- I do not know you, man!
- Kill him.

262
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,008
I've never seen you before.
Tell him!

263
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:43,175
Kill him.

264
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,050
No ...

265
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,800
Joe! Joe!

266
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,217
Come here!

267
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:24,967
It's all right, Joe!
It's okay!

268
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:28,883
Joe! Joe! It's okay.

269
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,633
You'll be fine.

270
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:35,758
He just will not rob you again.

271
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,300
Hopefully he plunders nobody.

272
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:42,050
It's okay, buddy.

273
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:46,092
It's okay. It's okay.

274
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,633
So.

275
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,967
It's all in order.

276
00:35:57,342 --> 00:36:00,133
It's okay.

277
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,258
Now we go. We go our way.

278
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:41,425
Hell, Joe. It's just me.

279
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:46,175
Take it easy, Joe.

280
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:49,883
It was a joke.
I was just kidding!

281
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:59,883
<i> Piggy told me what I should </i>
<i> clear and non-clear </i>

282
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:06,133
- <i> When I ought to say, </i>
<i> take control, say no. </i>

283
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:16,883
<i> He showed me situations, and how </i>
<i> they should have been tackled, </i>

284
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:22,258
- <i> To minimize damage, </i>
<i> or lasting damage. </i>

285
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:26,967
This is London, Joe. Understand it.

286
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:31,008
The fear in people's eyes.

287
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:35,550
<i> He explained to me </i>
<i> on body language. </i>

288
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:39,717
<i> things </i>
<i> I had never thought of before. </i>

289
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:46,467
Your brother often talked about you.

290
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:49,550
- Did he?
- Yes.

291
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:54,508
Two minutes, Joe.

292
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:21,175
<i> Piggy said that he did not </i>
<i> would kill an innocent. </i>

293
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:27,592
<i> He would kidnap one of them and get </i>
<i> him to say who attended. </i>

294
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:35,883
<i> He said that if we made a mistake, </i>
<i> we would be just as bad as them. </i>

295
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,008
<i> The plan seemed good, so </i>
<i> was no undue sacrifice. </i>

296
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,508
Perfect.

297
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,633
It is here we go with
from now on.

298
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,550
What?

299
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:57,883
- Why are you laughing?
- It's a pig nose.

300
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,258
Yes.
And you have to have it on when we go out.

301
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,925
- Why?
- We must apron us, Joe.

302
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:08,550
Shall we?

303
00:40:08,758 --> 00:40:12,633
No one has seen us yet.
It comes to the.

304
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:18,425
And then they will notice
a disguise.

305
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:23,217
- And that is what they will remember.
- Okay.

306
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:27,425
So ...

307
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:33,092
The more silly disguise is ...

308
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:40,550
... The less they will be able to remember
otherwise. Think.

309
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:46,258
All they will remember
This pig's snout.

310
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:52,758
And believe me, if the goofy snout
the last thing they see before they die-

311
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:57,217
- They arrive to hell
humiliated.

312
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:01,633
Psychology, right?

313
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:06,300
It's fucking smart. Honestly.

314
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:34,050
About one hour is dark.

315
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,967
- What should I say to her?
- Do not respond.

316
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:56,092
How are you? Are you outside?

317
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,967
Wait a minute, I let you in..

318
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:10,508
You better hide
in the other room.

319
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:14,008
Do not lose focus, Joe.

320
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:17,342
Do not lose focus.

321
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,092
Hey, you.

322
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:45,008
I miss him so.

323
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,550
That's it.

324
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:52,342
I do not know
how to work with it.

325
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,675
- Nothing gets better. It does not heal.
- Yes, I know what you mean.

326
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:03,425
And that someone did that to him ...
It was not an accident.

327
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:10,508
- I'm sorry. He's your brother.
- It does not matter.

328
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:15,842
I'm not an angry person. I
care about others. I'm not hateful.

329
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:23,425
- I know.
- But if I could ...

330
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:29,467
I think it is clear ...

331
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:37,050
But how can you live with
this in the head rest of your life?

332
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:43,008
They took not only his life,
but also his past.

333
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,967
Because you can not think of him
without thinking about them.

334
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,050
Are you okay?

335
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,550
Yes, it is.

336
00:43:58,758 --> 00:44:01,717
How do you know?

337
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:05,425
I got it just right.

338
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:11,758
John loved you very much.

339
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:18,925
Do you think they ever
catch them, Joe?

340
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,550
They get caught.

341
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,508
I promise you.

342
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:42,217
Okay.

343
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:45,592
- We know that there were five.
- Yes.

344
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:50,883
One by one, Joe.

345
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,467
One by one.

346
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,383
A very cheerful assembly.

347
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:20,258
Ham in blue.

348
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,008
We follow him.
Look where he lives.

349
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:26,883
How we begin.

350
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,758
He is alone.

351
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:37,217
Take your nose on.

352
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:42,300
Now it's not kidding.

353
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:46,800
When I say, so get the car.
Do not think, just do it.

354
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:48,925
- What did I say?
- Get the car.

355
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:52,092
- What?
- Get the car.

356
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,592
Ready? Come on.

357
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,258
Get the car.

358
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,383
Run.

359
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:05,342
Take his cap.

360
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:41,883
Do you know why you are here?

361
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:52,467
Take his knevel of.

362
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:07,133
What is this?

363
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:10,592
What the hell are you doing? I must ...

364
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,467
Get me out of here! You're dead,
do you know? Damn fool!

365
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:20,133
You are not in a situation
where you should swear at anyone.

366
00:50:22,342 --> 00:50:24,467
Take it easy!

367
00:50:26,717 --> 00:50:29,592
Damn!

368
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:46,008
Guess what ...

369
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:50,258
I know that you know
who killed John.

370
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,383
I can guarantee that you were there.

371
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:05,383
It was not me!

372
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:10,050
I know.
There were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of you.

373
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:19,467
Just say who they are.

374
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:21,758
Save yourself.

375
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:26,092
I do not know what you're talking about.

376
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:30,883
Yes, you do, you bastard.

377
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,925
I'll find them.

378
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,217
I find the bastards.

379
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:42,592
I beat them all to death.

380
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:48,175
I'll start with you.

381
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,883
- Yes.
- I know nothing.

382
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,092
I'll start with you.

383
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,092
Damn ...

384
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:46,842
Relax. He comes up.

385
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:52,217
Yes, it's just ...
He looks very paltry out.

386
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:54,800
He'll be fine.

387
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:48,717
Hi, this is Joe.

388
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:52,550
I'm not coming in today, because ...

389
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:55,800
I do not feel so good.

390
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,467
Thank you.

391
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,300
See you tomorrow, I think.

392
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:13,758
- Did I say that I move?
- No.

393
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:18,050
I can not afford
without him fool Justin.

394
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:21,925
- Is it over?
- Yes.

395
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,508
- I did not like him.
- Why not?

396
00:54:25,717 --> 00:54:29,300
I did this just is not.

397
00:54:29,508 --> 00:54:33,967
You can help me move,
if you want.

398
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:41,133
Have you heard that they have arrested
someone for murder?

399
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,467
- No.
- A local newspaper wrote about it.

400
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:52,258
"The arrest was connected to ..."
But they were shown released

401
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:57,092
- I think they are all happy.
- Yes.

402
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:01,217
Sorry, I'm talking about it.

403
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:05,217
It's okay.
It feels alligevel not virkeligt.

404
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:15,008
To the well, that there is virkeligt?

405
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:18,508
Yes.

406
00:55:22,175 --> 00:55:27,175
- What is that?
- You next, I'm here for you?

407
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,550
Yes.

408
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,883
- What do you want that low?
- Just be together.

409
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:48,467
- What do you want?
- The same.

410
00:55:50,092 --> 00:55:54,508
- I think about it. What do you think?
- The little black dress?

411
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:59,342
- Nej?
- Måske. Måske not.

412
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,758
- For the rest ... Shall we go?
- Whither?

413
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:34,925
I just want to go.

414
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:39,800
- Ned ad Gaden there.
- Okay.

415
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:05,258
- Where are we going?
- We can go the Vej.

416
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:09,550
- You wanted to go on Hovedgaden.
- There is enough cramped.

417
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:13,050
Okay. You have suffered strange now.

418
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,383
- What kigger you after?
- Not something.

419
00:57:19,425 --> 00:57:24,342
- Where are we Vej going?
- Primrose Hill ... I'm at it.

420
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,717
Where would you go to? What would you discount?

421
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:31,342
I want to Kentish Town. Okay?

422
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,883
- Nice.
- Is it okay? Come.

423
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:53,092
I, do not, if I should change
or budding at the same kursus.

424
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,383
- I do not.
- Really?

425
00:57:56,592 --> 00:58:00,675
- Listen ... I will have to go.
- What?

426
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:05,008
I have to go.
I'll call you, okay?

427
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:58,592
Good morning, good morning!

428
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:02,842
What the hell ...

429
00:59:03,842 --> 00:59:06,967
Come here.

430
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:09,550
Hello there!

431
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,300
Come now.

432
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,717
Shh ...

433
00:59:15,925 --> 00:59:19,258
Everything is in order.

434
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:43,133
Shh, shh ...

435
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,925
Look. He smiles, see.

436
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:54,175
He is happy. Are not you glad?

437
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:19,300
Ta-da!

438
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:23,550
- What the fuck?
- Hello.

439
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:29,133
What's going on?

440
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:36,217
I know, you kill John.

441
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:42,758
I'm know about it ...
cause your friend, Craig told me that.

442
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:51,842
It was Jamie. It was fucking Jamie.
It was his fuckin thing.There are missunderstood

443
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:54,800
You can not.

444
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:57,050
You were there.

445
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:59,883
Tell the truth.

446
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:04,800
I was there
but I dont kill him. please!

447
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:08,175
It was Jamie.
There are always fuckin Jamie!

448
01:01:08,383 --> 01:01:12,300
Jamie and Andy Pretson ...

449
01:01:12,508 --> 01:01:17,008
Frank Erswell. And Craig. Craig Raaz.

450
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:17,967
please!!

451
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,175
- Jamie Ritler.
- Jamie Ritler?

452
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:27,133
Yes, Jamie Ritler. Do not kill me.
I have a little girl!

453
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:32,675
Okay, okay! It's alright.
Cal Down. Nothing happens.

454
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:36,842
The finder is not Jamie.
He has bolted..

455
01:01:37,008 --> 01:01:39,800
He ran the next day.

456
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:43,717
I swear.

457
01:01:46,592 --> 01:01:49,675
I told you that it was not me!!

458
01:01:49,883 --> 01:01:53,217
It was not me. I swear.

459
01:01:54,675 --> 01:01:57,383
For the devil.

460
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:16,592
Host it. It is fine

461
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,092
It's good.

462
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,925
For the devil then!

463
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:25,092
Dump his body in the wilderness.

464
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:31,883
<i> Everything was different </i>
<i> for me, but was still same as before. </i>

465
01:05:33,258 --> 01:05:36,092
<i> I was a different person. </i>

466
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,842
<i> At least on the way to becoming so.. </i>

467
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:44,425
- What?
- I'm just having fun.

468
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:48,633
- Joe ...
- Shut the fuck up!

469
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:05,092
- Pitstop.
- What?

470
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,383
Jamie Ritler, this Pitstop.

471
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:12,175
- For what?
- Fabrics, apparently.

472
01:06:12,383 --> 01:06:16,217
- Not related to John.
- Satan.

473
01:06:16,425 --> 01:06:21,925
Custody.
It can last an eternity.

474
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:26,342
We should perhaps
take it easy.

475
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,550
Yes ...

476
01:06:29,425 --> 01:06:31,842
Maybe not.

477
01:06:33,133 --> 01:06:37,800
Now I know everything
Frank Erswell. Come on.

478
01:06:58,508 --> 01:07:00,967
This is fine.

479
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,175
A lovely night.

480
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:14,425
Do you think you are going to die now?

481
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,092
I will not die, man.

482
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,425
Say you are sorry.

483
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:41,092
I'm sorry, man.

484
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,842
We would not go that far.
I'm sorry.

485
01:07:46,842 --> 01:07:49,050
Sorry?

486
01:07:49,258 --> 01:07:51,883
- Sorry?
- Damn.

487
01:07:52,092 --> 01:07:55,050
Damn.

488
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:02,508
No ...

489
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,467
Revenge ... feels fucking great.

490
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:52,508
You probably should not be
so much with Claire.

491
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:56,425
What? What are you talking about?

492
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:01,925
What I mean, Joe. You know,
what I think is good for you, so ...

493
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:06,050
Then nothing. It does not concern you.

494
01:09:06,258 --> 01:09:10,425
- It was not nicely said.
- I've done everything you've asked for.

495
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:13,300
What have you,
what I do?

496
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:20,842
I just do not think that you need
becoming too involved. Okay?

497
01:09:21,008 --> 01:09:24,967
- You need to focus on the finish line.
- What a stroke?

498
01:09:26,258 --> 01:09:28,508
Our target.

499
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:34,092
That I do not agree in.

500
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:40,175
Okay.

501
01:09:40,383 --> 01:09:44,425
I have given my opinion.
Follow my advice or not.

502
01:09:44,633 --> 01:09:46,967
I do not.

503
01:09:47,175 --> 01:09:49,675
But do.

504
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:53,758
What you fucking.

505
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:35,633
Well ...! Goddamn it!

506
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:40,050
It stinks like hell!

507
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:43,300
Is he dead?

508
01:10:43,508 --> 01:10:45,967
I do not know. Ask him.

509
01:10:52,925 --> 01:10:55,550
Oh, God! God!

510
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,800
What will you do to me?

511
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,133
Oh ...

512
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:06,883
Your naughty boy.

513
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:09,883
You have shit in my pants.

514
01:11:11,592 --> 01:11:13,883
What shall we do now?

515
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,758
We have not given us.

516
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:21,883
I'm not saying anything to anyone,
if you let me go. I swear!

517
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:26,425
I swear by my father's grave!
I say to no one.

518
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:28,800
No, of course.

519
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:32,092
If my life depends on it ...

520
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:37,883
I will not ... I will not die.

521
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:41,925
- It would be my brother does not.
- Not even John.

522
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:44,717
Your brother?

523
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:47,467
I did not know.

524
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:53,258
Why would you? You asked
he's not a personal question.

525
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,008
- I said that it was not me.
- You were there.

526
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,008
- It was Jamie.
- You were there.

527
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:08,425
It was them. It was fucking Jamie.

528
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:11,217
You were there.

529
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,425
Yes, but Jamie is cooped up.

530
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,883
What? What do you think?

531
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,842
- Custody.
- For this?

532
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:32,508
- Substances.
- Substances, apparently.

533
01:12:32,717 --> 01:12:37,050
So he is fucking lucky!
Damn!

534
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:39,217
It's okay.

535
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:41,925
We get hold of him.

536
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:44,592
Listen.

537
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,467
I beg you, I beg ...

538
01:12:49,675 --> 01:12:51,967
- Listen to me.
- "Listen."

539
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:55,050
Let me go.

540
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,633
Let me go.

541
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,883
You know that we can not.

542
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:12,300
You're like our insurance.

543
01:13:12,508 --> 01:13:16,717
Sadly for you
you must stay here a while.

544
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:22,883
- Get out!
- Up to the chin.

545
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:25,675
No ... I shall not go.

546
01:13:25,883 --> 01:13:28,925
- Do not leave me, hear ye!
- Quiet.

547
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:33,592
I ask you. Do not.
Listen.

548
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,883
I shall not go.

549
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:41,008
Do not let me die like this,
hear ye!

550
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:45,217
I will not die!

551
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:50,217
We move him next time.
Playing a little more with him.

552
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:53,925
- Yes.
- <i> Do not leave me here! </i>

553
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,967
<i> Do not leave me, hear ye! </i>

554
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:02,217
<i> I will not die ... </i>

555
01:14:11,883 --> 01:14:14,842
- Hello!
- Hey, are you around?

556
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:19,175
- <i> Can you come? Do you remember Justin? </i>
- Yes.

557
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:23,550
He's outside, very full.
He has been there a long time.

558
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:28,050
- <i> I can not get him to go. </i>
- Relax. I'm coming.

559
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,133
- Justin ...
- Now close up, damn it.

560
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:37,008
- Who's that little shit?
- What the hell do you want? Go. Now.

561
01:14:37,217 --> 01:14:42,550
- Make me. It will be bloody.
- I think you should go.

562
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:47,050
- Your little pussy.
- How to not speak to her.

563
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:54,508
You are a fucking dickhead!

564
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:05,967
Let me see.

565
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:09,800
It's nothing.
I do not know why you ...

566
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,425
It ...

567
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,092
That's fine. Let me see the other.

568
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,258
Never mind that. Never mind.

569
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:32,300
Thank you.

570
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,258
- I must go now.
- You just got here.

571
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:43,883
Yes, but I ...
I have something to fix.

572
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,800
- You all right?
- Yes.

573
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,342
Joe! Joe!

574
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:05,342
Joe. We are finished.

575
01:17:10,508 --> 01:17:12,967
We are finished!

576
01:17:23,342 --> 01:17:28,425
- We're done, Joe! Finished!
- What the hell?

577
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:32,008
- We have been seen on film.
- How the hell did you get in?

578
01:17:32,217 --> 01:17:35,717
When we took Craig,
filmed a camera us.

579
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:39,175
We're done, dude. Finished!

580
01:17:39,383 --> 01:17:42,592
We must finish this tonight.
Tonight!

581
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,967
I can not do it here.
We run away immediately.

582
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:50,842
- No, we take Danny, tonight!
- It is ridiculous.

583
01:17:51,008 --> 01:17:56,717
- No, mate. Let me think.
- The decision was made for us, Joe!

584
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:59,842
I do not know what to do.

585
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,008
Do you go from me, Joe?
You do not suppose?

586
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:08,883
I did not say. It's just ...
It is much to cope with.

587
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:17,717
We must be one step ahead.
We take it, we can take in the evening.

588
01:18:17,925 --> 01:18:22,717
We save us, we wait a year,
we'll take Jamie.

589
01:18:22,925 --> 01:18:26,467
But you do it this time, Joe.

590
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:30,342
You do it!

591
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:33,758
For your wonderful brother John.

592
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:44,967
<i> I did not know what thoughts </i>
<i> was mine or Piggys. </i>

593
01:18:45,175 --> 01:18:47,925
<i> By sharing brain with anyone. </i>

594
01:18:48,133 --> 01:18:52,300
<i> to be full of ideas, </i>
<i> which may not be one's own. </i>

595
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:57,258
<i> I trusted no longer on my </i>
<i> intuition. What food I liked. </i>

596
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,842
<i> Music, clothes ... </i>

597
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,758
<i> Who is it? Come on! </i>
<i> Who the hell is that? Come on! </i>

598
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:16,592
Who the hell are you?

599
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:24,800
Hell ...

600
01:20:29,633 --> 01:20:33,050
Who the hell are you?
What are you in my house?

601
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:09,800
It did not quite
as planned.

602
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,342
I can not do it here.

603
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:22,050
- Joe, stay.
- It's over.

604
01:21:22,258 --> 01:21:25,467
- I do not want more.
- How it works not.

605
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:29,883
- Says who?
- You! This is what you wanted!

606
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,967
Come on!

607
01:21:36,842 --> 01:21:39,717
<i> I knew what I wanted. </i>

608
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:42,883
<i> My brother's murderer. </i>

609
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:45,883
<i> I wanted them dead. </i>

610
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:48,633
<i> But it was imagination. </i>

611
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:54,342
<i> Now it felt like that when we did </i>
<i> this, we destroyed the imagination. </i>

612
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:59,883
<i> That's the problem with a fantasy. </i>

613
01:22:00,092 --> 01:22:04,675
<i> As soon as it becomes reality, </i>
<i> It no longer exists. </i>

614
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:13,092
Do not be afraid.
You can come home after this.

615
01:22:24,092 --> 01:22:28,967
<i> Every day I waited for the police. </i>
<i> When the phone rang, because I up. </i>

616
01:22:29,175 --> 01:22:32,925
<i> When the doorbell rang, </i>
<i> I hid. </i>

617
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:56,883
<i> I began to hope </i>

618
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:01,092

619
01:23:14,425 --> 01:23:17,967
<i> And for a while everything was quiet. </i>

620
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:28,508
<i> But only one time. </i>

621
01:23:36,508 --> 01:23:39,383
Joe? Joe!

622
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,217
Wake up, Joe!

623
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:47,467
Wake up, honey,
the food is ready.

624
01:23:49,092 --> 01:23:51,217
Joe?

625
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,717
Joe!

626
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:20,925
Damn!
Banks never on?

627
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:26,092
We're going to hunt, Joe.

628
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,258
What?

629
01:24:29,758 --> 01:24:34,342
- What the hell are you doing?
- I told you, she made you crazy.

630
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:38,883
You know nothing about her.
Do not mix her into this.

631
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:42,592
We're going out, Joe. Tonight.

632
01:24:44,383 --> 01:24:47,592
What are you talking about?
It is no more left.

633
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,217
Yes, it is.

634
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:54,592
There are other, Joe.

635
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,592
You can help.

636
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,925
We are finished!

637
01:25:03,967 --> 01:25:06,508
It's over! Okay?

638
01:25:10,925 --> 01:25:13,842
We are not finished, Joe.

639
01:25:14,925 --> 01:25:17,883
We are not finished, Joe!

640
01:25:20,717 --> 01:25:23,592
We are not finished, Joe.

641
01:25:25,633 --> 01:25:28,342
We are not finished.

642
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,217
We are not finished.

643
01:25:35,425 --> 01:25:38,133
We are not fucking finished.

644
01:25:44,508 --> 01:25:47,925
I have no idea who the hell you are.

645
01:25:54,342 --> 01:25:58,258
I have no idea who the hell you are.

646
01:26:06,175 --> 01:26:09,633
I have no idea who the hell you are!

647
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,383
I have no idea ...

648
01:26:30,342 --> 01:26:34,300
Why do you never talk about,
what happened?

649
01:26:41,592 --> 01:26:44,342
- I do not know.
- It's just ...

650
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:47,217
I see no reason for it.

651
01:26:47,425 --> 01:26:50,842
I know you're upset.

652
01:26:51,008 --> 01:26:53,800
It felt just not.

653
01:26:55,342 --> 01:27:01,467
If you wanted to talk about it ...
If you would be upset ...

654
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,883
Why would anyone want
to be outraged?

655
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:13,133
I did not mean it like that, but just ...

656
01:27:14,133 --> 01:27:16,883
If you wanted to talk about it ...

657
01:27:18,217 --> 01:27:20,675
I'm here.

658
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:28,008
The only thing in my head.

659
01:27:30,467 --> 01:27:32,883
I mean ...

660
01:27:34,633 --> 01:27:38,758
... Nothing changes just because
you walk up to it. Well?

661
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,008
Well ...

662
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:45,217
Rubbish ...

663
01:27:46,592 --> 01:27:48,925
Good or bad.

664
01:27:51,592 --> 01:27:54,883
Nothing changes you
No matter what you think.

665
01:28:20,383 --> 01:28:23,550
I understand.

666
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:25,717
That's my fault.

667
01:28:29,425 --> 01:28:32,842
It was my fault.

668
01:28:34,592 --> 01:28:37,133
Are you okay?

669
01:28:46,883 --> 01:28:50,925
Associate you not to me, you hear!

670
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:57,175
You are still safe.
It was my fault!

671
01:30:16,258 --> 01:30:18,425
Piggy!

672
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,717
Piggy?

673
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:55,675
THE notorious DRUG SELLER AND
BAND LEADER RITLER convicted Today

674
01:32:00,592 --> 01:32:01,800
RITLERS RECORD LONG PENALTY

675
01:32:52,842 --> 01:32:57,883
You knew nothing of John, do you?
You've never met him!

676
01:32:59,092 --> 01:33:02,092
What the hell does that mean?

677
01:33:06,258 --> 01:33:08,967
Good grief ...

678
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:13,342
What role does it, Joe?

679
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:16,883
You could do what you wanted.

680
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,883
I gave you just an excuse.

681
01:33:22,092 --> 01:33:26,883
I did it all right
by saying that it was not.

682
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:35,092
You're crazy.

683
01:33:47,175 --> 01:33:50,300
And you could have stopped,
when you wanted to.

684
01:33:51,383 --> 01:33:54,133
But you did not.

685
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:58,717
You did not,
for you have made you a victim.

686
01:34:00,508 --> 01:34:02,883
You are weak.

687
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:09,508
You're just like the others who do not
stand by it. You are fucking weak.

688
01:34:12,967 --> 01:34:16,133
You are meaningless.

689
01:34:16,342 --> 01:34:18,842
You are a shadow.

690
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,175
Your brother knew it safe.

691
01:34:23,383 --> 01:34:26,633
And you knew it for sure.

692
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:33,050
And all the others who were fortunate enough
to socialize with you-

693
01:34:33,258 --> 01:34:39,633
- Over the last 20 years
a your miserable life, knows it too.

694
01:34:44,425 --> 01:34:47,342
And you know what, buddy?

695
01:34:49,592 --> 01:34:53,258
That's why you're so good at violence.

696
01:34:55,092 --> 01:34:58,217
For the weak people.

697
01:35:01,925 --> 01:35:08,675
You are tough to commit violence because
You have so much repressed anger.

698
01:35:10,133 --> 01:35:13,258
You do not know
how to be yourself.

699
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:19,175
You do not know
how to be someone else.

700
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,967
And what happened your brother ...

701
01:35:28,925 --> 01:35:32,883
It gave you just an excuse
to do what you did.

702
01:35:33,842 --> 01:35:37,550
And that's all people like you
need, right?

703
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:40,508
An apology.

704
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:46,925
One way to get it to feel right.

705
01:35:50,342 --> 01:35:54,050
You are a mirror, Joe.

706
01:35:54,258 --> 01:35:58,508
You're a fucking mirror
of what is out there.

707
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:04,008
For every miserable bastard,
who got up and went out today.

708
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:11,008
What is it, buddy?

709
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:15,092
Have I made you angry?

710
01:37:00,133 --> 01:37:02,883
It's a damn shame, Joe.

711
01:37:03,092 --> 01:37:06,300
I thought really about you.

712
01:37:06,508 --> 01:37:09,008
I really did.

713
01:37:43,592 --> 01:37:46,383
You can go now.

714
01:37:50,467 --> 01:37:52,800
Just go.

715
01:38:27,717 --> 01:38:31,425
<i> Now I understood, </i>
<i> exactly what to do. </i>

716
01:38:31,633 --> 01:38:36,092
<i> I understood what Piggy had </i>
<i> taught me what he would say. </i>

717
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:56,467
<i> when John died, I died too. </i>

718
01:38:58,258 --> 01:39:01,008
<i> That was it. </i>

719
01:39:01,217 --> 01:39:07,342
<i> I was tied to it. </i>
<i> I could not put it behind me. </i>

720
01:39:15,383 --> 01:39:20,217
<i> And now there was only one way </i>
<i> to move forward. </i>

721
01:39:38,342 --> 01:39:43,133
I'm moving in a few weeks.
I have to do a lot.

722
01:39:43,342 --> 01:39:47,842
It's a shame, Joe.
You are always welcome here again.

723
01:39:48,967 --> 01:39:51,883
Thank you.

724
01:40:21,467 --> 01:40:24,508
This is for me now.

725
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,050
<i> Piggy was an Avenger. </i>

726
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:08,383
<i> He arranged things I could not. </i>
<i> He changed everything. </i>

727
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:23,925
<i> Piggy was all </i>
<i> they wanted him to be. </i>

728
01:41:41,175 --> 01:41:44,300
<i> I knew he would not die. </i>

729
01:42:15,383 --> 01:42:20,425
<i> Now I knew that it was my responsibility </i>
<i> to finish what we had started. </i>

730
01:42:28,217 --> 01:42:31,258
<i> And I promise to finish it. </i>
