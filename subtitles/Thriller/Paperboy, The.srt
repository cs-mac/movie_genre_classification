1
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,997
Just tell me when
you're rolling.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,473
We're rolling.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,442
A lot of people...

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:15,140
Have questioned what
really happened.

5
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,650
And when the novel
was first published,

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,879
it didn't take long

7
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:24,548
for there to be even
more questions asked.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,058
It's always remained a mystery.

9
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,651
And that's why I
wanted to thank you

10
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,061
for coming in to meet with us.

11
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:38,331
To help shed some
light on the events.

12
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,235
Okay.

13
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,173
He dedicated the book to you.

14
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:45,301
Can you tell us how
much of his novel

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,709
was based on fact?

16
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:47,803
All of it.

17
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,510
It was 1969...

18
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,555
What can you tell us
about that summer?

19
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,091
Question? What was
the question?

20
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,654
What do you remember
about that summer 1969?

21
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,394
It was hot. It was real hot.

22
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,833
God must have been
sweating, it was so hot.

23
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,106
Tell me about the murder.

24
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,815
Hey, how much, how much I'm
getting paid for this?

25
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,656
Well, sheriff call was
this evil, nasty,

26
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:37,787
disgusting son of a gun.

27
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,101
Black people hated sheriff call

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,405
because he killed so many of us

29
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,843
during his two
terms in service.

30
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,655
Some of my family was included.

31
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,818
White people feared him too.

32
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,962
So somebody got fed up with
his fat ass, and killed him.

33
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,835
That's what happened
that summer.

34
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,531
They say he dragged
his intestines

35
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,596
for a mile before he died.

36
00:02:56,942 --> 00:03:00,275
Crazy white people even
built a statue for him.

37
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,778
How did it come about

38
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,250
that you worked
for the jansens?

39
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,480
I was cleaning for
them part time,

40
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,217
right when his mamma ran off.

41
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,624
And ward and I, ward
was his brother,

42
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,856
he was in high
school at the time

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,898
and we raised him together.

44
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,695
Little Jackie was
five at the time.

45
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:25,464
Where was his father?

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,098
W.W. Was just

47
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,766
chasing girls, you know.

48
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,072
And running the
local newspaper.

49
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:36,979
The moat county tribune.

50
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,710
How's ward?

51
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:42,220
He's good, he's good.
Real busy.

52
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,188
Ward was a writer...

53
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,421
Uh... for the Miami times.

54
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,862
He used to write about, uh...

55
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,093
Well, he was kind of
famous, you know,

56
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:59,160
'cause he wrote about the
civil rights movement

57
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:03,538
and the poor and the
unjustly accused.

58
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,271
That's how come
that lady Charlotte

59
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,279
started writing letters to him.

60
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,508
Stuff like that.

61
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,346
Yeah.

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,683
And then Jack, like I
said, he was a swimmer.

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,155
And, uh...

64
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,953
Almost professional,
very close but then

65
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,617
he got kicked off
the swim team,

66
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,094
he got kicked out of college,

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,031
and he came back home to his papa's
house to deliver newspapers.

68
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,963
He didn't want to
come back home,

69
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,628
but he didn't have
nowhere else to go.

70
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,004
Yeah?

71
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,047
Mmm?

72
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,048
Jack, you better turn
that music down.

73
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,243
You know w.W. Gong
be mad at you.

74
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,315
Dang it, Anita, can
you please knock?

75
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,791
I could've been
jerking off in here.

76
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,888
Please, it ain't nothing
I ain't seen before.

77
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,693
What are you doing?

78
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,859
I'm picking up your stuff,
like I do every day.

79
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,166
Oh come on, not today.
It's too hot for that.

80
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,297
I'm just helping.

81
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,342
You're not helping me. You
don't have to help me.

82
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,808
Come on.

83
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,367
Get off the bed
so I can make it.

84
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,673
Go fix me some collard Greens.

85
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,237
It's my bed.

86
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,442
I know it's your bed. Really?

87
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,418
Because it's your bed, you
should fucking make it.

88
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,251
They canceled "the
smothers brothers."

89
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,484
Oh, no, that's your show.

90
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,858
Well, I love that show. I
love dick and I love Tommy.

91
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,195
Lay down. Let me be you for a second.
Oh, yeah, right. Get me in trouble.

92
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,827
You want to be me, I get to be you?
Okay.

93
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:41,066
Okay, I'll love this.
Jack, may I come in?

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,768
Oh, good, okay. Go away, go out.
Go back out.

95
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:49,179
Okay. I better start
jerking off first. Okay.

96
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,375
Jack, sorry to interrupt
your masturbation,

97
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,384
but I'm here to clean the bed!

98
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,317
I could've been jerking off!
I'm gonna clean everything!

99
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,287
I could have been jerking off!

100
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,290
Get out! Clean my shit up!

101
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,088
Get all that we have
received in return,

102
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,686
is just another smooth exercise

103
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,924
in political manipulation.
Good girl.

104
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,025
Deceit and deception,

105
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:12,502
callousness and indifference
to our individual problems,

106
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,904
and the disgusting playing
of divisive politics,

107
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,569
pitting the young
against the old,

108
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,136
labor against management,
north against South.

109
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,409
Did you want to see me?

110
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,247
Have you spoken to
ward this week?

111
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,446
No. Hello, Jack.

112
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,751
He didn't mention anything
to you about coming here?

113
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,521
I can't believe your father's
making me report on this.

114
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:37,562
I mean, look at her.

115
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,598
To open our society.

116
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,259
She plans to run for
president next.

117
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,565
They want to talk to
Hillary van wetter.

118
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,835
Don't you let that
pulitzer prize fool you.

119
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,709
He don't know everything yet.

120
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,437
Ain't no reason to come up here

121
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,507
stirring up shit
with that asshole.

122
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,146
I just wanted to say that
it is very important

123
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,315
for all Americans
to recognize...

124
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,724
Charlotte bless loved
her some dangerous men.

125
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,523
She wrote men in prison.

126
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,223
She finally fell
in love with one.

127
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,357
She was determined
to get him out.

128
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,401
Why y'all ain't got
no ice in here?

129
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,197
You want ice, go to your house.

130
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,102
Charlotte.

131
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,106
Oh, that's my show. What
you think, Charlotte?

132
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,699
I don't like it.
Make it looser.

133
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,403
That's that nigger
you've been writing?

134
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,377
No. This is my white man.

135
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,004
Oh.

136
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,539
What happened yesterday?
I missed it.

137
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,677
Listen to this. He
thinks I'm his angel.

138
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:38,245
His angel? Shh. Shut your face.

139
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,054
Bitch, how old is he?
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,951
He's a fine motherfucker
that's trying to fuck you.

141
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:44,823
"Ever there was an
angel in the world,

142
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,865
"my angel, it must be you,

143
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:50,663
but no angel would do the
things I dream that you want."

144
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,228
Your angel, his angel.

145
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,672
Mm-hm. That's hot.

146
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:02,339
He say, "if you truly exist, I
may become a religious man."

147
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,779
Ah!

148
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,617
"All my life, my heart has
tried to find a place

149
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,322
I cannot name... a home."

150
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,626
You need to find
yourself a young one.

151
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,188
He'll fuck you real good.

152
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,702
He says I'm his home. Hm.

153
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,398
Got a hundred different men

154
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,338
writing her from
the penitentiary.

155
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,705
That's her man.

156
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,268
Oh, no. This is my man.

157
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,076
This here's the one.

158
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,616
Mm-hm.

159
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,016
Ward came home to investigate

160
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,523
the conviction of
Hillary van wetter.

161
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,992
The town wasn't too
happy about it

162
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,427
and neither was his papa.
Oh, shit. Ugh.

163
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,435
Ward...

164
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,870
There's a horse in
the parking lot.

165
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:03,134
It's our ride home, yardley.

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,810
Uh, where is everybody?

167
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,904
It's Sunday.

168
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,347
People's either at
home or at church.

169
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,581
It's a shithole.

170
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,035
Hey, man.

171
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,270
Hey, you.

172
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,679
How you doing?

173
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,510
Jack, meet yardley ache man.
Hey.

174
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,050
My little brother, Jack.
The swimmer, right?

175
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,578
Yeah, he's our driver now.
Right, good.

176
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,920
Here, let me get these.

177
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,155
That's my typewriter.
You've gotten big, boy.

178
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,787
Just be careful with
the typewriter.

179
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,061
Got all pumped up. Is
that from swimming?

180
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,068
Not anymore.

181
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,110
No! No! No!

182
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:15,442
Yardley's real particular
about his suits

183
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,449
and his typewriter. Well,
it's very expensive.

184
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,444
Yes. Thank you.

185
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,592
How do I get in?

186
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,863
Watch your head.
Watch your head.

187
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:36,332
Don't touch my head. Tell him
where you're from, yardley.

188
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,232
London.

189
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,101
Ah!

190
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,403
When I came here...
From New York,

191
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,842
I was interviewing
for the job...

192
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,608
And I was in advertising
in New York

193
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:53,913
and I mentioned that it was
simply different in New York.

194
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,815
So how'd you get
from New York City

195
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,657
to the Metropolis
of lately, Florida?

196
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,357
Jansen residence.

197
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,766
So I came down South and I
interviewed at the paper.

198
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,362
W.W., miss Roberta's
on the phone.

199
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,373
No, no, no.

200
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,068
We don't take phone calls.
Anita...

201
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,667
Who's miss Roberta?
No calls, Anita.

202
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,517
What part of London
you from, yardley?

203
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,545
Um, all over London.

204
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:33,921
Is there a good dry cleaning here?
Excuse me?

205
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,586
Dry cleaning.

206
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,653
Dry cleaning? Yes.

207
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,597
You ain't gonna eat that, are you?
Uh-uh.

208
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,329
How you gonna win those swimming
meets if you don't eat?

209
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,468
I'm retired.

210
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,839
Retired. Jack, you ain't even
tired enough to be retired.

211
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,476
How is it exactly you guys work?

212
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,544
I mean, like that boy
drowned at his initiation?

213
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,557
Well, yardley's the writer...

214
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,360
And I'd guess you'd say
ward is the nuts and bolts.

215
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,365
Yeah. When I was a reporter,

216
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,628
we had rewrite men who took
the stories over the phone.

217
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,829
No, no, no. I'm not
a rewrite man.

218
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,633
I'm the writer.

219
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm the one who puts the
facts into perspective.

220
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,536
Oh!

221
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,079
Yes. It's a different
world now, Mr. Jansen.

222
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,614
Clearly.

223
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,619
Times have changed a bit, sir.

224
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,518
What interest does
"the Miami times"

225
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,149
have in Hillary van wetter?

226
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:41,817
He murdered somebody in jail?

227
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,020
Even if he was guilty...

228
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,530
It was a lynching, pure and simple...
he had certain rights.

229
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,623
And even if he was guilty...

230
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,067
Hillary has rights that the
process completely disregarded.

231
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,901
And that's why we're here.

232
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,272
I'm very sorry, everybody, but
I'm going to have to leave.

233
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,334
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

234
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,778
I have early evaluations
first thing in the morning.

235
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,281
Come here, sugar. I apologize.

236
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,475
All right, buddy.

237
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,888
Ward?

238
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,116
Good night, boys.

239
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,550
Ward?

240
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,994
Seems mighty sure of
himself for a colored.

241
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,903
Ward said they need a driver.

242
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,498
A driver?

243
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,702
What you do out there?

244
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,576
So you meet anybody new
out there in Miami?

245
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,776
I met a few.

246
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:44,151
Oh, yeah. All types
down there, you know?

247
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,849
You stay away from
those rough ones.

248
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,824
Remember what happened
the last time.

249
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,056
How your kids?

250
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,892
You look beautiful, babe.

251
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:55,933
They're doing good. They're
doing really good.

252
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,764
As soon as I get out of here,

253
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:02,034
I'll go see them and make
dinner all over again.

254
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,066
You should come to
that dinner, too.

255
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,570
I'll come to that dinner.

256
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,744
I think Ellen is
maybe number four...

257
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,309
Since you left.

258
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,485
Yeah.

259
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,616
That's why I don't take
them bitches too seriously.

260
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,219
They come and they go and
they come and they go.

261
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,628
You know what I mean?

262
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,199
At last my dreams come true?

263
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,637
Today he said "I do "?

264
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,903
Friends said it
couldn't be done?

265
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:41,673
But all his love
I know I've won?

266
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,079
How you doing there, yard?
Oh, jeez.

267
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,246
That's where he placed
the wedding band?

268
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,190
Hey, close that door, boy.

269
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,387
I don't want your daddy
screaming about all the flies

270
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,861
getting in the house.

271
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,091
Hmm.

272
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,100
Who is that, Jack?

273
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,225
Uh...

274
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,103
I'm looking for the
office of Mr. Jansen.

275
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,145
Ward Jansen of
"the Miami times."

276
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,680
I said who is it? I
work for the times.

277
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,272
You do? Yeah.

278
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,414
Huh.

279
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,683
Well, I'm Charlotte bless.
I'm Jack Jansen.

280
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,781
Here, let me get that. Oh.

281
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:29,418
Hey. All my files.

282
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:32,395
The office is in the garage.

283
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,399
You look a little young
to be a journalist.

284
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,197
I'm really just the driver. Oh.

285
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,329
But I do write.

286
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:44,239
So do I. I write letters.
I'm pretty good.

287
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,946
Hey, guys!

288
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,675
This here is miss
Charlotte bless.

289
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,580
Oh, not for long.

290
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,642
Hillary and I are
engaged to be married.

291
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,584
Hello, miss bless. I'm ward.

292
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,385
Oh, Mr. ward, good
to finally meet you.

293
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,264
You didn't mention the engagement in your letters.
Go clean yourself up.

294
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,592
Well, it only just happened.
He just proposed.

295
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,097
Oh, that looks nasty.
Well, how did I do that?

296
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,326
Excuse me a second.

297
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,665
Get miss bless something to drink.
I'm yardley ache man.

298
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,567
We thought you and
Hillary hadn't met.

299
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,162
Well, only in pictures,

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,901
but we been writing
each other for months

301
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,910
and we understand
ourselves just perfect.

302
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,808
Ward, where should
I put her files?

303
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,744
Everything you need to
know about van wetter

304
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:23,940
that's been in the papers,

305
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,676
is here in these boxes.

306
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,082
Our exciting correspondence
is in that box.

307
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,848
In case you're interested.

308
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,987
My desk, Jackie boy.

309
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,796
Mr. Jansen, I really just
wanted to thank you.

310
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,801
I wanted to thank you for
returning my letters.

311
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,668
And for helping me get Hillary
out of that hellhole.

312
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,900
Well, I wouldn't go booking
the honeymoon just yet.

313
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,464
But we are going to
fight his sentence

314
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,305
and the way it came about.

315
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,368
Thank you. Thank you so much.

316
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:59,042
Nobody deserves the death
penalty, miss bless.

317
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,312
Not even Hillary van wetter.

318
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:05,220
Um, excuse me. So, everything
is ordered alphabetically.

319
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,781
I was telling, um...
What's your name?

320
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,123
Yardley. Yardley.

321
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,220
Um, that all of the files,

322
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,731
um, everything that's
been in the papers,

323
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,064
is in the top box. This
is gonna be a great help.

324
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:20,331
He's an innocent man.
You're gonna find that out.

325
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,168
Wrongly convicted.

326
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,880
This is gonna get us
off to a great start.

327
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,207
I've done a lot of research.
I see that.

328
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,712
In the meantime, you need
to freshen up or anything?

329
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,307
Jack, show miss bless to the washroom.
I think I'll just stay here.

330
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,784
You might have some questions
that you need answered.

331
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,343
I can freshen up just here.

332
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,380
Cold beer for me, Jack.

333
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,254
You're adorable, Jack.

334
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,157
I will take an iced
tea if you have it.

335
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,957
You want anything, ward?
I'm good.

336
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,998
You'll see, uh...

337
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,397
It's an enormous amount of work...
what's with the boxes?

338
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,994
I don't know what to do here.
What's with the boxes?

339
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,198
Well, we're gonna start on it.

340
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,731
My Jack was in love
with Charlotte bless.

341
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,505
I could tell that
horny little boy

342
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,047
wanted to jump her
on first sight.

343
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:08,074
Everybody was confused why she was
engaged to Hillary van wetter.

344
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,452
Nasty, white trash swamp.

345
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,855
"All the killers who
have written me"

346
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,019
want to press their
mouths into my vagina

347
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,054
and some, even the
crack of my behind,

348
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,760
except Hillary van wetter.

349
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,930
He has no such desire.

350
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,135
He wants to be
sucked off himself.

351
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,405
"I consider this psychological
proof of his innocence."

352
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,973
She is one nasty
little nut job.

353
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,574
Think we've been taking her
a little too seriously.

354
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,745
You sure get bored quick.

355
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,821
No. Can tell I'm not going
to get laid anytime soon

356
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:47,791
in this floridian
shit pit, so...

357
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,986
Listen... hey, Kathy, it's me.

358
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,995
Hillary tells her
that the knife.

359
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,122
Yardley. And the bloodied shirt

360
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,690
that the deputies claim to
have found in his house

361
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,862
somehow got lost
before the trial.

362
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,929
Yeah, I miss you, too.

363
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,770
What?

364
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,307
Hello, Kathy.

365
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,441
Miss bless wanted to
look at the prison.

366
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,076
Jack's first assignment
was to take her there.

367
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,181
I bet he knows I'm here.

368
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,246
See, people who fall
in love outside...

369
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,293
Of a normal relationship,

370
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,128
they have these powers...
Telepathic powers.

371
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:31,293
Hillary and I have that kind
of connection, you dig?

372
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,606
Now why ain't you in college?

373
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,342
Huh?

374
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:47,351
Uh, I was a swimmer
when I was in school.

375
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,148
No kidding? Yeah.

376
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,313
I was a swimmer. You were?

377
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,254
Uh-huh. I'd swim like a mermaid

378
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:56,987
if it wasn't for my
damn curly hair.

379
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,053
I think straight
hair gives me class.

380
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,792
All right.

381
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:03,993
Good.

382
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,537
So?

383
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,335
Well, we was drunk one
night, and, uh...

384
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,678
I just...

385
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,681
I lost my temper and just...

386
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,049
Well, I emptied the pool.

387
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,576
At your college?

388
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,178
The university of Florida.

389
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:30,226
They called that
vandalism, I guess.

390
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,695
It's actually not as
easy to do as it sounds.

391
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,195
So you lose your temper often?

392
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,663
Mm.

393
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,332
This place is full of
boys just like you

394
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,103
who lost their temper one day.

395
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:52,509
I'm getting horny being
this close to him.

396
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,117
Oh, baby.

397
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,446
I bet he's horny for
me all the time.

398
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,081
Yeah.

399
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,116
Mmm.

400
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,761
Oh, I can feel him.

401
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,192
Can I help you folks?

402
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,636
Oh, no.

403
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:20,567
Yes, officer. Uh... hm.

404
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,581
We just wanted to sit in your
parking lot for a little while.

405
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,708
What for?

406
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,275
His daddy's in there and we wanted
to send him good vibrations.

407
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,412
Some good what?

408
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:35,152
Oh, these special things
called good vibrations.

409
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,023
Sorry, ma'am. Y'all
can't park here.

410
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,428
Oh.

411
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:43,092
Yes, officer.

412
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,271
The story that Hillary
told the deputies

413
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,973
was never investigated.

414
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,745
He simply told it once
from the witness stand

415
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,445
and was never asked
to elaborate,

416
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,419
not even by his own lawyers.

417
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,928
Good to see you again, ward.
Nice to see you.

418
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:31,944
Sir, this is my writing
partner, Mr. yardley ache man.

419
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,681
Of course.

420
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:42,726
I suppose the best
place to start

421
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,489
would be the beginning.

422
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,189
I was born in this county.

423
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:50,701
1897, to poor but
proud parents.

424
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,430
Mr. pine, could
we skip 65 years,

425
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:55,233
save everyone some time?

426
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,175
Hillary van wetter, 1965?

427
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,805
Oh, I can't agree to talk
to you about that matter.

428
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,974
Not without my
client's permission.

429
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,815
He's entitled to his privacy,
just like anybody else.

430
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,651
You have his permission.
He wrote you.

431
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,884
I'll have to check that out.

432
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,358
I'm sure the letters would
be in your files, Mr. pine.

433
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,554
That's what you say, but I
have a client to protect.

434
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,959
Look here.

435
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,366
If we have to get a lawyer
of our own down here

436
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,700
to sort this out,
then while he's here,

437
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:32,436
we're gonna have him look through every
aspect of Mr. van wetter's case.

438
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,070
Including the competency
of his defense.

439
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:38,115
There was nothing wrong with the defense
Hillary van wetter got in court!

440
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:40,673
Then you have nothing
to worry about from us.

441
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,049
We just want to talk to him.

442
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,712
Then we'll be out of your...

443
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,517
You don't know a thing
about this person!

444
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,118
You've been in this world
for five minutes, boy!

445
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:53,391
Now that's just not
necessary, Mr. pine.

446
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:55,694
Yes. I talk the way I
want in my office!

447
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,928
All right. Then you'll arrange
the meeting, will you?

448
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,306
Quick! We're gonna be late!

449
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,072
You get the marriage license?

450
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,702
I can't believe we
're doing this!

451
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,672
Fuck! Jack, go knock
on the door again.

452
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,207
There she is. Whoa, baby.

453
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,886
Well, I say... Good
morning, miss bless.

454
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:54,083
Look at Daisy mae.

455
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:55,523
Morning.

456
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:56,685
You look just fine.

457
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,160
Hope he likes it.

458
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,193
Uh...

459
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,260
Would you mind putting
up the windows?

460
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,669
It's gonna muss my hair.

461
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,135
Are you serious?

462
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,373
I'm sweating like a
pregnant nun back here.

463
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:19,973
Unbelievable!

464
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,725
Hi.

465
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:55,776
You got 15 minutes.

466
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,343
No physical contact
of any kind.

467
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,253
No tape recorders.

468
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:00,984
No object may be passed
to the prisoner.

469
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,356
I'll be right
outside this door.

470
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,929
Mr. van wetter,

471
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,199
my name is ward Jansen.

472
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,903
This is my associate, yardley ache man...
you look like your picture.

473
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:24,880
Mmm. I do?

474
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,917
Thank you.

475
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,888
These your paperboys?

476
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,021
Mm-hm.

477
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,822
What they gonna do for us?

478
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,129
They gonna save you.

479
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,258
They're gonna save us?

480
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,934
Mm-hm.

481
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,438
Shit. They can't even
save themselves.

482
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,173
Mr. van wetter, we
wanted to ask you

483
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,737
about the lost
evidence in your case.

484
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,976
Shut up. Can't you see I'm busy?

485
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,549
Will you do something
for me right now?

486
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,891
Oh. Oh, I wish I could.

487
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,835
Spread your legs
open a little bit.

488
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:25,940
Mmm. Yeah.

489
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,944
Now tear off them pantyhose.

490
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:29,741
Rip those off.

491
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,847
Yeah. Mm-hm.

492
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,819
Move your hands away. Mmm.

493
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,687
Yeah.

494
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:48,755
Now open up your mouth...

495
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,858
You picture what you wrote
me in your letters.

496
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,073
You bitch!

497
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,938
Oh, I love you.

498
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:13,642
What the hell's
going on in here?

499
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,879
You're a good girl. I warned y'all!
This visit's over!

500
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:17,514
I told y'all this visit was...
come on!

501
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:18,886
Come on, Hillary. No!

502
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,151
No! There's nothing going on!

503
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:22,886
Shit! No!

504
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,452
What the fuck? I didn't
touch that girl!

505
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,327
No! No!

506
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,367
What the fuck you
laughing about?

507
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,399
Come on now, miss bless.

508
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,840
Jack came home and
threw up after that.

509
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,638
He couldn't believe
he still loved her

510
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:43,271
after what he saw, but he did.

511
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:46,578
You're ward ward's boy? Mm-hm.

512
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,711
Most contrary man in
all of moat county.

513
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,982
What may I do for you
gentlemen today?

514
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,721
It's about the murder
of sheriff call.

515
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,854
I understand that there's
some physical evidence

516
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,057
relating to the
case that was lost?

517
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,533
Yes, sir. I believe there was.

518
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,002
Well, we was wondering
what sort of explanation

519
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,665
the department might have.

520
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,934
I wish I knew.

521
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,644
Mr. van wetter once cut
a deputy's thumb off.

522
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,346
Did you know that?

523
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,512
It was over a traffic
ticket, if I remember.

524
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,351
You can't do much
without your thumb.

525
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:30,292
It's what separates
us from the primates.

526
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,457
For a little thing like
holding your wife's titty.

527
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,695
You're not married, Mr. Jansen?
No.

528
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,432
A little thing like
that, you can't do it.

529
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,468
Maybe I'll just go
talk to the deputies

530
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,376
who was involved in the arrest.

531
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,210
You can talk to
whoever you want

532
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,648
as long as they'll talk to you.
But they won't.

533
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,948
And why is that?

534
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,352
They haven't forgotten what
Hillary did to one of theirs.

535
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,980
The judge allowed testimony

536
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:01,684
based on evidence that
he never even saw.

537
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,659
He took the officer's
word over Hillary's.

538
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,959
I can't say I blame him.
Nobody does.

539
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,036
You got me in the face there.

540
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,045
So you've got to ask him.

541
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,178
Where was he between
2:00 and 6: 00?

542
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:31,585
I'm gonna ask him about
some things he wrote,

543
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,247
some letters to Charlotte.

544
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,894
Here we go.

545
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,192
Hold.

546
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,294
Good morning, Mr. van wetter.

547
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:51,369
Hey.

548
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,568
Where's your dress?

549
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:57,739
You don't like me like this?

550
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,375
You know a prisoner
by the name of...

551
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,941
Ward, ward, ward.

552
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,611
You know a prisoner by the name

553
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,121
of Mr. Bobby Valentine?
Mr. van wetter?

554
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,784
Mr. Demarcus Williams,
Mr. Bobby hinton?

555
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,259
Another prisoner by the
name of Jimmy Edwards,

556
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:13,489
another one, Demarcus.

557
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,623
I think his name is curt.
I forgot his last name.

558
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,860
Anyway, you know what
they all have in common?

559
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,563
Hey, Martin Luther King.

560
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,606
You know what they all
had in common? What?

561
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:25,198
They all wear pants.

562
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,403
Every goddamned man
in here wears pants!

563
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,446
How am I supposed to tell
you apart from them?

564
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,209
Don't talk to her like that!
Sit down, Jack.

565
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,147
Sit the fuck down.

566
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,412
Mr. van wetter, we don't have
a lot of time, all right?

567
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,249
We got to move on.

568
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,812
You're gonna move on one
way or another, ward?

569
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,051
Ward's in charge!

570
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,721
He's gonna get his way...
Till he don't.

571
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:48,594
Maybe that's how he got
his scars on the face.

572
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,571
You mentioned in one of
your letters to miss bless

573
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,129
that you was working
turn around, bitch!

574
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,438
An Uncle tyree... yeah, yeah.

575
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,102
At the time of the murder.

576
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,167
What kind of work you doing?
Lawn work.

577
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,873
Lawn work.

578
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,779
You wear a dress
in here next time

579
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,478
or you don't bother coming!
Bitch, look at me!

580
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,314
And stop bringing
that fucking nigger

581
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,189
think he muhammad Ali with you!

582
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,784
Mr. van wetter,
come have a seat.

583
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,023
Cassius Clay, nigger.

584
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:21,724
We can get a dress
here in five minutes.

585
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,993
Why don't you have a seat?

586
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,034
Go home, boy!

587
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,840
I don't know...

588
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:33,934
Charlotte, where does one get
pants like that from anyway?

589
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,980
Well, I think we got
the case licked.

590
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,605
This is a fucking circus!

591
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,950
In this town,

592
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,991
weldon pine helped get
sheriff call re-elected.

593
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,151
Tension was brewing
in the house.

594
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:53,355
Jack was getting jealous
of Hillary and Charlotte.

595
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,098
And he was getting jealous
of ward and yardley, too.

596
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,801
Ward wasn't somebody who attached
himself to just anybody.

597
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,275
Your dad's girlfriend,
what's her name?

598
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:10,177
Jack couldn't understand why he
was so attached to that yardley.

599
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,579
No, you didn't.

600
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,345
What is the hottest temperature

601
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:15,817
that you've ever been in?

602
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,353
125.

603
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,219
How about you?

604
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,349
Just put your hand out
and it burns off.

605
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,586
The hottest was when I lived in Florida.
How about you?

606
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,255
It doesn't bother me. I
never pay attention to it.

607
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,061
Cold and wet just goes fucking
through you like a knife

608
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,126
but... I don't know.

609
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:37,401
So how's Mr. van wetter today?
He still innocent?

610
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,942
I don't know. If he is...

611
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,207
He sure as hell didn't
have no help proving it,

612
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,145
not from that weldon
pine guy anyway.

613
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:47,775
Could I have a
fork or something?

614
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,786
The chicken legs, you eat
those with your hands.

615
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,583
Maybe at your house.

616
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:54,556
This is the South, sugar.

617
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,025
Anyway, you know how
I feel about that.

618
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,222
Do you eat your mashed potatoes with your hands?
Do you really want to...?

619
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,139
Do you really want to...?
Do you really want to...?

620
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:04,028
Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

621
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,535
Do you really want
to take the shot...

622
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,072
On putting to death
a man or a woman

623
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:13,235
when maybe they're innocent?
I mean, I don't.

624
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,871
I don't want to try to
have to live with that.

625
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:20,781
On the other hand... are you
gonna eat that or torture it?

626
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,284
Told you, I'm not hungry.

627
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,617
That's 'cause you're in love.

628
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,679
I know who you're
sniffing around, too.

629
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,486
Anita, please don't
tease him at the table.

630
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,424
On the other hand, if
somebody's guilty,

631
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:34,430
well, you want to pay
their room and board 365?

632
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:35,362
Absolutely. Ah!

633
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,990
Whoops.

634
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,661
I'm so sorry.

635
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,570
Anyway, it's just iced tea.
It ain't even gonna stain.

636
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:48,171
You'da thought Jack would
had a girlfriend by now,

637
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,179
but all he did was jerk
off to the pictures

638
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,774
in those nude magazines
that was under his bed.

639
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,548
Now she was all he could
think of night and day.

640
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,782
Oh, yeah, he was
definitely in love.

641
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,218
He needed her.

642
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,626
What you reading?
You give it to me.

643
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,825
What is this shit? " Lolita."

644
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,834
Porno, I bet.

645
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,135
Oh.

646
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,675
You need a girlfriend.

647
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,377
Look at them girls over there.

648
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,683
Go on and introduce yourself.
Go on.

649
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,285
I'm just fine right here.

650
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,462
You want me to blow
you, don't you?

651
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,968
You don't have to answer.
I know it's true.

652
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,235
I'm not gonna blow
a friendship...

653
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,675
Over a stupid little blow job.

654
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:58,670
You hear me?

655
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,012
Look, why you talking
to me like that?

656
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:06,045
See that one in blue?
She'll blow you.

657
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,250
I don't want someone
like that blowing me.

658
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:10,555
It's a good thing
you're not in prison

659
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,424
because you wouldn't
have a choice there.

660
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,163
Fuck you.

661
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,605
Jack, come back here.

662
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,909
Well, well?

663
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:36,578
I passed the corner
where we first met?

664
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,712
Yes, I did?

665
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,021
Memories of our love
linger there yet?

666
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:48,295
Oh, I'm sitting on
top of the world?

667
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:52,961
Just to know that
you're my girl?

668
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:56,699
I'm just lucky?

669
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:01,643
I'm lucky, lucky,
lucky in love?

670
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,121
Our love is here...?

671
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:30,137
Lucky, lucky,
lucky in love...?

672
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:44,348
Oh, I'm sitting on
top of the world?

673
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:47,185
Just to know that
she's my girl?

674
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:49,987
That makes me lucky?

675
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,359
Oh my God. Pam.

676
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,863
I'm so lucky lucky
lucky in love?

677
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,628
Let me sing one more time?

678
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:00,431
What is that? Is he okay?

679
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,994
Is he having an
allergic reaction?

680
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,040
A jellyfish sting or something?

681
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,699
A fucking jellyfish did that.

682
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,710
You're supposed to piss
on a jellyfish sting.

683
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,712
We're gonna have to do
something embarrassing.

684
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,680
You got to hang in there. Hey!

685
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,545
Well, you're gonna...
You'll piss on him?

686
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,209
What are you doing to him?

687
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:16,877
Call an ambulance.

688
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,683
He's having a reaction!
Shut the fuck up!

689
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,450
Don't push me! You're
supposed to piss...

690
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,117
Get the fuck out of here!
I can see this.

691
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:24,820
I can see he's poisoned.
You don't pee on...

692
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,090
Don't push me! I
will slap your face.

693
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,223
Get the fuck out of here.
All right.

694
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:32,700
I said, I will kick your ass!
I'm going to call the police.

695
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:34,532
Move it! Fine.

696
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,471
If anyone's gonna piss on
him, it's gonna be me!

697
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,064
Fine, fuck you!

698
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,938
He don't like strangers
peeing on him!

699
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,409
Come on. Come on.

700
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,469
Come on, baby come on! Wake up!

701
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,014
Come on! Shit!

702
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,845
LA LA LA?

703
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,645
Zippeydoo da?

704
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,586
Come on.

705
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:54,846
Come on!

706
00:39:56,593 --> 00:40:00,529
No matter what people say?

707
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:04,033
I know our love
is here to stay?

708
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:08,538
And I'm so lucky?

709
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:09,867
You're gonna be okay!

710
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,704
Lucky lucky in love?

711
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:16,212
I'm mister lucky?

712
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,443
I'm so lucky lucky
lucky in love?

713
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:20,710
Jack.

714
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,183
What are you doing here?

715
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,720
What do you think
I'm doing here?

716
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,718
Told you to knock on my door

717
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,831
before you come in my room.

718
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,292
Oh, hush up.

719
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:33,522
Here, I brought you something.

720
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,030
Take these pills.

721
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,260
I smell awful.

722
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,064
That's because that blond
lady peed all over your face.

723
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,705
Ugh. Here, drink this.

724
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,141
Does it hurt?

725
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold.

726
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:08,230
Congratulations, Jack.
We're in the paper.

727
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:12,667
" Fast action saves
lately man at beach."

728
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,601
"Miss Charlotte bless
of mobile, Alabama"

729
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,764
apparently saved
Mr. Jansen's life

730
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,899
by urinating over the
areas of his body

731
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,103
where he was attacked.

732
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,170
"These included the victim's
arms, genitals and face."

733
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:25,874
Jack, I had no idea.

734
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,314
I had no idea that
your own father

735
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,783
would print something
like that.

736
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:30,410
It made the ap wire.

737
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:34,355
You're famous all
over the country.

738
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:38,451
" Home remedy." Good title.

739
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:41,656
What's dad trying to do to me?

740
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,701
It's called the newspaper
business, Jack.

741
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:49,802
Oh, shit.

742
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,308
Let him go, Jack!
You're gonna kill him.

743
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:07,015
Jack, let him go.

744
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,738
You put your hands on me again,

745
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,232
I will fuck you up! Yeah?

746
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,459
Fuck you, nigger!

747
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,044
He needs to get laid.

748
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,443
He needs a fucking
straitjacket.

749
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,106
He's sexually repressed.

750
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,945
Sexually repressed is
a 40-year-old woman

751
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,919
who's obsessed
with prison cock!

752
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,852
That's not nice. Calm down now.

753
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:40,583
No, fuck calm down!

754
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,852
I'm not having some
kid call me a nigger.

755
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:44,007
I want him out of here now!

756
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,388
Yardley?

757
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:58,037
Jack, let's go to the prison.

758
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,871
You two can stay here
and keep arguing.

759
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,706
This time I'm talking
to Hillary by myself.

760
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:03,268
Come on.

761
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:05,007
He's not even gonna look at you

762
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,073
if I'm not there
in a pretty dress.

763
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,118
Well, that's too bad for him.

764
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,710
Ward.

765
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,251
You'll see.

766
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,796
I knew Jack didn't
mean to say it.

767
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,963
But those were the times
we were living in

768
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,563
and it was what it was.

769
00:43:32,642 --> 00:43:35,304
Yardley, on the
other hand, well...

770
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:43,419
Get out of the cold?

771
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,218
Take the night off?

772
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,226
Be your own boss?

773
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:54,661
When you're near me?

774
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:56,494
Can you hear me?

775
00:43:56,566 --> 00:44:00,662
Or do I have to
shout in your ear?

776
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,034
Mmm?

777
00:44:02,105 --> 00:44:05,336
Take the night off?

778
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:09,105
Turn the light on?

779
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,613
Take the night off?

780
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,343
Turn the light on?

781
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:17,011
Forensic report says
that the sheriff

782
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,578
was stabbed between 2 and 3 am.

783
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,419
Yep. Like I told you,

784
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,686
I was with... my Uncle
tyree doing lawn work

785
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,352
in Ormond beach at the time.

786
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,623
Lawn work? Yes, sir.

787
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:29,528
You mean stealing? Yes, sir.

788
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,590
Stealing sod off a golf course.

789
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:34,796
A developer paid through
the teeth for that shit.

790
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:36,351
We sold it and we
didn't make it back

791
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,068
to the river till sunrise.

792
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,041
What kind of developers?
Condominiums, man.

793
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,203
You got a name? No, I don't.

794
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,305
Deputies say they found the
sheriff's body at 6 am...

795
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,441
But it was the way
he was killed.

796
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,545
That's what makes everybody
assume it was you.

797
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:55,557
What you think? You tell me.

798
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:58,219
I ain't the only one carrying
a machete around here.

799
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:02,031
True.

800
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,296
The deputies went
to Tyree's house,

801
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:07,427
he said he'd been
sleeping in bed all night

802
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,065
and had a whole bunch of family
members there to confirm it.

803
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,132
Then they go to your house...

804
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,735
Where they find the
bloodstained shirt and knife.

805
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:18,178
Yeah, all right. Listen to me.

806
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,342
Every knife and shirt that
I own is stained in blood.

807
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,942
It's what I do for a living.

808
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:25,351
I'm gutting alligators
for their skin.

809
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,185
Okay? I was a bachelor.

810
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,283
I didn't have nobody
to do my laundry.

811
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,260
You probably got somebody
to do your laundry.

812
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,353
What you think?

813
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,029
I bet you do.

814
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:41,602
They never matched the blood
to the sheriff's, did they?

815
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,400
Tell me how to find tyree.

816
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,205
The arms of mercy are so wide

817
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,944
they will accept any man,

818
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,852
but they will not accept
any man wearing pants.

819
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,221
Where is my woman?

820
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:06,728
Where's my woman?

821
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:10,391
The only one you need to talk
to right now is me, baby.

822
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,900
The only one I need to talk to?

823
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:13,526
I'm the only one.
I'm your mercy.

824
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:15,628
I'm your arms wide
open, I'm your pants.

825
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,865
Ward's in charge!

826
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,612
If you wanna go see tyree,
I'll give you directions,

827
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:30,141
but you got to make that choice
because he's a violent man.

828
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,915
Now stay with me now

829
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,888
because this is when
it gets tricky.

830
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,152
Ward called Charlotte

831
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:41,061
and told her to drive
yardley to Ormond beach.

832
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:45,329
He wanted to verify Hillary's
so-called golf course story.

833
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,428
The boys went on to
visit this Uncle tyree.

834
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,099
Man, this is stupid.
Where are we going?

835
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:53,369
No one lives out here. No
one could live out here.

836
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:58,005
You talk to Anita about your...
choice of words?

837
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,845
It was fucked up.

838
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,344
I know.

839
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,299
Goddamn it.

840
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,801
Sure you don't me
to watch the car?

841
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:25,039
Goddamn it! This stuff
ain't working, man.

842
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,042
It's like they like this shit.

843
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,543
Better than jellyfish, I bet.

844
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,347
Fuck! Oh, my God!

845
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:34,440
Watch it! You're way too close to him.
Ward! Ward!

846
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:37,418
You better jump him.

847
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,546
It's better in here where
we have to get lower.

848
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,991
Ward, you're sinking!

849
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:47,689
This whole place
is just floating.

850
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,899
You ever think about mama?

851
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,082
I wonder where she at.

852
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,152
She is in Tucson, Arizona.

853
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,691
You got a girlfriend?

854
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:30,696
Why?

855
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:43,117
You don't remember this, but
mom used to go on about, uh...

856
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:46,622
Don't make love to a woman until
you get married, right? Mm-hm.

857
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,455
I followed that until I was...

858
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:58,128
Oh, fuck that. We'll
talk about it later.

859
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,293
Let's go.

860
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,712
Mr. van wetter?

861
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,719
Good afternoon, sir.

862
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:19,050
My name is ward Jansen. I
work for "the Miami times."

863
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,716
We're here on behalf here
of your nephew, Hillary.

864
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,952
You lost a shoe.

865
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,923
You're lucky it
was just the one.

866
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,764
Snakes all around here.

867
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,829
We need to talk to you about
your nephew, Mr. van wetter.

868
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,566
Little late for that, isn't it?

869
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,838
He gonna be strapped to a
chair and electrocuted.

870
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:44,743
Well...

871
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:47,510
You come all the way up
here just to tell me that?

872
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,245
You could've saved
yourself a trip.

873
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,753
He tells me that
he was with you

874
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,789
the night sheriff
call was murdered,

875
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,688
stealing sod, which
you later sold.

876
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,258
Let's hope nobody believes him.

877
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,356
Stealing's against
the law, ain't it?

878
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,196
Now he's still got time.

879
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,004
I don't much care for you.

880
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,407
Come up here in my home...

881
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,536
And call me a thief.

882
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:23,210
I ain't up here about
thieving, Mr. van wetter.

883
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:27,950
I'm up here about whether a man's
life needs to be taken or not...

884
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,889
For the murder of sheriff call.

885
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,127
But if you was with
your nephew that night,

886
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,397
it's vital for Hillary
that you admit it.

887
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,897
I don't think he
likes you much.

888
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,407
I don't like him much either.

889
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:54,814
Where's the ice cream?

890
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,341
It's coming.

891
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:57,909
Keep that baby quiet.

892
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,354
What's wrong with that baby?

893
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,895
All right, well, sit on it.

894
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,433
Yeah.

895
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,172
You want...?

896
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,211
You want a little ice cream?

897
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,550
You don't want to
have any ice cream.

898
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,849
You take this chair
out here with me.

899
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,424
No sense you staying
over there.

900
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,621
Thank you.

901
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,687
Little man, get
yourself a chair there.

902
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:42,788
Get yourself a chair.

903
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:48,700
Was you with him?

904
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:50,261
Yeah.

905
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,238
Well, I...

906
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,572
I was with him.

907
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:58,402
Where?

908
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,050
Golf club.

909
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,916
Ormond beach.

910
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,151
Stole sod, sold it...

911
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,425
To this one condo developer.

912
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,626
Where's Hillary live from here?

913
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,930
We didn't get back till
the morning, sunrise.

914
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,203
He lives that way.

915
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,103
So why are you telling me now?

916
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,071
You seem like the only person
thinks Hillary's innocent.

917
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:36,349
No, sir, Mr. van wetter.
No, sir.

918
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,681
I didn't say that.

919
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,147
Your boy...

920
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,553
He's getting nervous
over there.

921
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:46,492
Let's go. I'm done
talking to you.

922
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,562
What you hiding? Ward?

923
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:51,930
I'm sick...

924
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,832
Of your questions.

925
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:57,634
Eugene?

926
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:08,444
Ward, remember the first day
when I was with Charlotte? Yeah?

927
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,042
We went and stopped
at the prison.

928
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:13,213
We didn't go in. I saw him.

929
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:15,280
Tyree? Yeah.

930
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,986
What you think? They was getting
their stories together?

931
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,392
I don't know.

932
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,963
I'll tell you this.

933
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,328
They ain't as dumb
as they look.

934
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,799
Oh, shit, man.

935
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,729
Fuck.

936
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:42,308
What the fuck, man?

937
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:45,681
Leave me at the fucking hotel?

938
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,279
Jesus!

939
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:48,755
In yardley's room, no less.

940
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:49,985
Fuck, man. Look at you.

941
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,489
You're becoming obsessed
with this case.

942
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,158
Wake me up.

943
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,336
Wake me up.

944
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,872
Come on.

945
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,669
You look terrible, ward.

946
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,711
Those mosquitoes eat
you for breakfast?

947
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,042
Yardley found the golf course.

948
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:13,947
You found the golf course?
What's he doing in my clothes?

949
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,618
The car broke down.

950
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,348
We had to walk into town,

951
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,687
stopped by the motel
to freshen up.

952
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,193
Get out of my clothes now.

953
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,799
Come on.

954
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,358
Come on, Jack.

955
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,371
What are you doing?

956
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,202
Miss bless. Come on, stop it.

957
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,434
Jack!

958
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,111
On the morning of the murder

959
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,375
the grounds superintendent of
the ormond beach golf course

960
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,882
phoned the police department

961
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,383
to report that
four of his Greens

962
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,045
had been stripped in the night.

963
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,815
You talked to the superintendent?
No.

964
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,823
He died, but I found
another guy who remembered

965
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,325
that the club
called the governor

966
00:54:57,393 --> 00:54:59,327
to ask him to declare
them a disaster area

967
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:01,226
so they could get federal funds

968
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,389
to replace the Greens.

969
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,092
It gets better.

970
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,828
I found the builder, too,

971
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,426
the guy who bought
the stolen Greens.

972
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:09,562
He remembered
Hillary and tyree.

973
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,903
They showed up at
6 am in a truck.

974
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,101
He took one look at
them and what they had

975
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:18,341
and thought they'd stolen
it from a cemetery.

976
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:21,144
But of course, he doesn't want to
be connected to this in any way.

977
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,777
And who was he?

978
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,582
Well, the only way
he'd talk to me

979
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,179
is if I promised to
keep him anonymous.

980
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:28,917
Come on now. What's his name?

981
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:30,788
No, no, no.

982
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,820
I've got to keep it anonymous.
I gave him my word.

983
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,591
He's got, well,
he's in a position

984
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,792
to get some work from
the state, so you know.

985
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,529
But good, huh?

986
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,036
Outstanding.

987
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:47,139
How'd you find him?

988
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,542
Building permits.

989
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,382
Damn building permit.

990
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,783
Time to get out of lately.

991
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,023
Did you sleep with yardley?

992
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:07,726
You know, people like
yardley, you just...

993
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,828
Got to get him on your side.

994
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,234
You know what I mean?

995
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:19,069
You fucked him for that?

996
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,575
Fucking a man is the most natural
thing in the world, Jack.

997
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,911
It is.

998
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:30,908
It is.

999
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,083
I kind of like it out here.

1000
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:44,993
This was a good idea.

1001
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,098
Ooh!

1002
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:52,333
Come on! Let's dance.

1003
00:56:55,711 --> 00:56:57,440
Come on! No!

1004
00:56:57,513 --> 00:57:00,607
Come on, Jack. Got to have fun!

1005
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:07,553
You wanna dance?

1006
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:10,114
Yeah! I wanna dance with you!

1007
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,127
Woo! You're good!

1008
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,640
This is not me
apologizing, you dig?

1009
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,873
I just don't like
to see you sad.

1010
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,323
Yardley told their editor
about the new evidence

1011
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:49,762
from ormond beach.

1012
00:57:49,832 --> 00:57:52,926
This was enough to show injustice
in the legal system of lately

1013
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,936
and enough for a good story.

1014
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,438
Yardley wanted to
get out of town

1015
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:58,996
and ward knew it.

1016
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,748
All these peanuts on the floor.

1017
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,016
Pigs. Bunch of pigs
living around here.

1018
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,387
Sick of this shit.

1019
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,758
I can't find mama's ring.

1020
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,526
Oh, well, a nigger
must have come

1021
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,658
in the middle of the
night and stole it.

1022
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:36,242
I'm sorry, Anita.

1023
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,507
I didn't mean to say...

1024
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,477
I didn't mean to say that.

1025
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,178
And I'm really sorry.

1026
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,950
You know, Jackie, you got
to watch your mouth.

1027
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,517
Somebody'll cut your little
ass over some shit like that.

1028
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,389
You understand me, boy?

1029
00:58:57,466 --> 00:58:58,490
Yes, ma'am.

1030
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,670
And you miss your mother?

1031
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,504
Sometimes.

1032
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:12,308
It's a dis-damn grace
the way she left you.

1033
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:18,648
And I been here.

1034
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,425
Well, let's find
this ring, I guess.

1035
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:27,087
No, that's all right.
I can find it.

1036
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,715
Oh. Sorry.

1037
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:51,082
All right.

1038
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:53,948
Okay.

1039
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,685
I'm really sorry. Okay.

1040
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,795
All right, Jack.

1041
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,127
What's makes this
story any different?

1042
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,895
What makes your story different
than the others, John?

1043
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:09,062
What makes this case so different
that you want to pull the plug now?

1044
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,867
The facts. What's left to do?

1045
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,532
You've been up there
a month and a half.

1046
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,200
I want your ass back here.

1047
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,210
Save that shit for
someone else.

1048
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:18,542
I'm not comfortable with it
and you shouldn't be either.

1049
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:20,309
I'm going to ormond
beach to get the facts.

1050
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:25,979
I want to get some
alligator shoes.

1051
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,252
You run this article,
this shit could hurt me.

1052
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,555
I got advertisers to think of.

1053
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:34,596
Advertisers? You want
me to be concerned

1054
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:36,756
with the advertisers
for your newspaper?

1055
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:38,231
Ward, you don't
know everything.

1056
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,733
He knows what he's doing, pa.

1057
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,565
Shut up! I'm not
talking to you.

1058
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:43,502
He knows how to get stories,

1059
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:45,597
but what he doesn't
fully appreciate

1060
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:48,609
is that the stories go
out into a community.

1061
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:49,905
They resonate.

1062
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,674
Oh, like the jellyfish?

1063
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:54,181
Like getting pissed on?

1064
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,276
You notice Anita's been
acting mighty bossy recently?

1065
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:02,119
She's always been that way.
Yeah.

1066
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:06,857
Oh, shit.

1067
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,523
Darling, let it go. Don't
get yourself hurt.

1068
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:12,123
Sit down. I'll get Anita.
Anita!

1069
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,431
Hey, I'll take care of it.

1070
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:17,666
Anita will get it. Anita! Does she
have children? I can't remember.

1071
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:23,273
She got two kids. Oh, yeah.

1072
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,878
How you doing, baby doll?
Where you going?

1073
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,816
Hoo. A baby shower.

1074
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,979
Um, Anita, uh, before you go,

1075
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,989
could you clean up this mess.

1076
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,321
I said I got it. It's all right.
Anita's got it.

1077
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:42,052
I got it.

1078
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:44,464
I got it.

1079
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,262
We're going to ormond beach.

1080
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,736
Oh, just come right
out and tell them.

1081
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:53,172
I've named Ellen
editor-in-chief.

1082
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,579
And...

1083
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:00,842
We're getting married.

1084
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,823
It's an antique.

1085
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,090
I know it is.

1086
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,600
This belonged to my mother.

1087
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:21,431
It was a gift from me.
Give it back, Jack.

1088
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,835
Just give it back to her.

1089
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,931
It's all I got.

1090
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,101
Ward never believed
yardley's story.

1091
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,145
Building permits and
anonymous sources.

1092
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:32,874
He took Charlotte and
Jack back to ormond beach

1093
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:34,882
to get to the bottom of it.

1094
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,941
Yardley went back
home to Miami.

1095
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,180
That man is dangerous?

1096
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:43,356
Loving him is dangerous?

1097
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,724
That man is dangerous?

1098
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:51,895
Loving him is dangerous?

1099
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,364
That man is dangerous?

1100
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:59,973
What is that builder's
name, Charlotte?

1101
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,907
What builder?

1102
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:03,968
You know exactly what builder.

1103
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,412
The one yardley says
bought the sod.

1104
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:07,813
I don't know. He went alone.

1105
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:10,852
I went to the hairdresser's.

1106
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:12,580
Takes a lot to look like this.

1107
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:16,318
Charlotte bless, you is a mess.

1108
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,587
And you'd do anything
to get your man

1109
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,994
out of jail... wouldn't you?

1110
01:03:26,468 --> 01:03:27,935
Thirsty, huh?

1111
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:29,163
Oh, yeah.

1112
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:32,230
That man is dangerous?

1113
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,674
You keep staring like that,

1114
01:03:34,743 --> 01:03:37,405
we're gonna have a problem.

1115
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:40,277
What really happened
down there, Charlotte?

1116
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,681
After you went to the
hairdresser, what happened? Hm?

1117
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:45,151
Jack, would you tell your brother
to get his hands off of me?

1118
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:48,179
Come on, man. Let's go somewhere else.
Easy, little brother.

1119
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,418
Just fucking relax, boy.

1120
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,585
Miss bless ain't got
no answer, huh?

1121
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,589
I didn't think so.

1122
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,466
Your brother's acting strange.

1123
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,870
Not used to drinking like this.

1124
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,465
Is this love affair for real
or is it just one and done?

1125
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,534
I'm telling you?

1126
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:11,135
A little more than that.

1127
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,352
Why is ward doing this?

1128
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,450
We got 50 places
to be tomorrow.

1129
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:34,558
What is that?

1130
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:37,299
It's beautiful.

1131
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:42,572
Don't turn it down.

1132
01:04:42,644 --> 01:04:45,374
No one's ever given me
something like this before.

1133
01:04:51,653 --> 01:04:54,713
Well, you just tell me when
you want it back, huh?

1134
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,225
It's beautiful.

1135
01:05:15,043 --> 01:05:18,877
You want me to fuck you, Jack?

1136
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:22,713
Then I'm gonna fuck
you any way you want.

1137
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:28,055
Jack.

1138
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:31,951
Jack!

1139
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:36,225
I want to get some
alligator shoes.

1140
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:38,391
Mmm, Jack.

1141
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,197
You wanted your ass whipped.

1142
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,737
Is that what you wanted?

1143
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,363
Tell me what you want.

1144
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,998
You're a dirty pig.

1145
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:48,235
I'll fuck you any way you want.

1146
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,710
Little white pig.

1147
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:56,818
Jack? Jack! Jack!

1148
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:57,909
Jack, wake up!

1149
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,284
Something's going
on in ward's room.

1150
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,145
Hey! Hey!

1151
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,947
Stop it!

1152
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:32,213
What the fuck?

1153
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:38,186
Help! We need help!

1154
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,561
Where's the fucking keys?

1155
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,827
Where's the fucking keys,
you piece of shit?

1156
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,835
Motherfucker, wake up!

1157
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:24,569
Help!

1158
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:29,235
Where are the fucking keys?

1159
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,040
Ward, what's the plastic for?

1160
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:34,906
What is the plastic?

1161
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:42,822
What the fuck?

1162
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,542
I've watched you so often.

1163
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,605
You sit here, and I heard
that you play a little drum.

1164
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,516
You didn't get up and do anything.
No.

1165
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,247
I heard you could sing,

1166
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,879
but with me you are
going to sing.

1167
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,119
He's gonna be fine.

1168
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:01,792
You don't have to sleep
all the way down there.

1169
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,425
All right.

1170
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,196
Just this once.

1171
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:44,835
I can't fuck with this TV on.

1172
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,451
Feels kind of awkward
to be talking

1173
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,986
while you see this.

1174
01:09:58,226 --> 01:10:01,992
But it's kind of awkward that they're
doing it in the first place.

1175
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,133
Most boys Jack's
age fall in love

1176
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:12,469
with their high school
or college sweetheart,

1177
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,169
but Jack never bothered
much with girls

1178
01:10:15,243 --> 01:10:16,471
after his mama left.

1179
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,249
I guess you could say he
had abandonment issues.

1180
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,413
With Charlotte, it was like
he was getting his mama,

1181
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:31,016
his high school sweetheart,
and a oversexed Barbie doll

1182
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,924
all rolled into one.

1183
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,526
Any who, I think
y'all seen enough.

1184
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,608
My hair looks like crap.
Don't even look at it.

1185
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,371
Oh, shit.

1186
01:10:49,444 --> 01:10:51,878
I got to go to the hairdresser.

1187
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,780
My wig ain't acting right.

1188
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,249
I don't understand
what the fuck

1189
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,945
you're doing with Hillary.

1190
01:11:01,556 --> 01:11:02,454
Oh.

1191
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,053
Here we go.

1192
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,686
You don't love him.

1193
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,891
Really? Mm-hm.

1194
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,297
You don't know that.

1195
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,662
You don't know anything.

1196
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:18,899
You're 20 years old. You're
not that much older.

1197
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,903
I'm a lot older.

1198
01:11:23,478 --> 01:11:25,469
It ain't gonna happen.

1199
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:26,707
Look at me.

1200
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,306
It's not practical.

1201
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:30,715
I'm not as practical
as the murderer?

1202
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,913
He's not guilty, Jack.
That's the point.

1203
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,218
That's not the point. Fuck this.
I knew it would happen.

1204
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,723
What?

1205
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,419
I give you some ass
and suddenly...

1206
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:44,424
Look... Hillary ain't so bad.

1207
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:46,763
And I'm not so good.

1208
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,326
I've got another side.

1209
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:51,133
I got a fucked-up side,

1210
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,174
and it gets along just
fine with my man.

1211
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,106
You can't split
yourself into sides.

1212
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,042
Sure, you can. Just
ask your brother.

1213
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,273
What the fuck does ward
have to do with this?

1214
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:01,387
He has a dark side and I
don't mean him being a fag.

1215
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:05,284
Now these boys lived
for each other.

1216
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:09,585
Jack wasn't hurt by
ward being a homosexual

1217
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,525
or the dark stuff
that he was into.

1218
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,961
He was just hurt that
ward never told him.

1219
01:12:21,102 --> 01:12:23,195
Hi. Hey, there.

1220
01:12:25,273 --> 01:12:27,673
He's doing better. He's
gonna be all right. Good.

1221
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,375
So, I gotta go.

1222
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,705
Go where? Where you going?

1223
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,441
I'm going back home.

1224
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,646
You don't have to go anywhere.

1225
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:43,486
It's just the way it works.

1226
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:45,458
You shouldn't go anywhere
you don't want to go.

1227
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,560
Who says I don't want to go?

1228
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,397
Why do you have to go?

1229
01:12:57,405 --> 01:12:58,633
'Cause I do.

1230
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,702
Take this ring back.

1231
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,002
Yardley called the hotel.

1232
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,945
Did you tell him?

1233
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,245
I told him ward got mugged
and beaten on the beach.

1234
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,252
Well, what'd he say?

1235
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:16,688
Not much.

1236
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:18,749
Wanted to know if he
was gonna make it.

1237
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,159
When I told him it
wasn't serious,

1238
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:24,494
he kind of just lost interest. He's
not gonna be much help for a while.

1239
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,592
Didn't sound like he
needed much help.

1240
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,103
He can't go write the
story alone, Charlotte.

1241
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:33,197
Well, we'll just have to see. He
doesn't know enough about it.

1242
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,072
This isn't about a
newspaper article, Jack.

1243
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,668
I it's about a person's life.

1244
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,372
That's the whole point
we're here, okay?

1245
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:40,209
So it's about someone's life.

1246
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,851
Baby, don't go.

1247
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,048
You're starting to
screw with my head.

1248
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,858
Look, you're a good
kid, all right?

1249
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,055
You're...

1250
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,395
You got your whole
life ahead of you,

1251
01:13:58,466 --> 01:13:59,933
and you want me?

1252
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,533
Jack went down to
"the Miami times"

1253
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,975
to try to stop yardley from
publishing the article.

1254
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,573
He didn't want his
brother's name on it.

1255
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:17,144
Jack.

1256
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,482
Hi.

1257
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:24,491
Hey. How's ward? How's
your brother doing?

1258
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:26,584
Been trying to get a hold
of you since yesterday.

1259
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:29,255
Good. He's obviously not
doing so badly then.

1260
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:34,268
Sorry, I didn't want any distractions.
Come, sit, sit.

1261
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,668
He wants to read
what you're writing.

1262
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,263
As soon as I'm done, he'll be the
first to read it, as always.

1263
01:14:39,307 --> 01:14:42,435
Damn it! I'm so sick
of your shit, man!

1264
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,375
His name is on that, too.

1265
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,438
He wants to read it
before it's published.

1266
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:49,278
Okay? That's it. Uh-huh.

1267
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,945
He just wants to read it
before it's published.

1268
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,113
You got to get those
facts straight.

1269
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,453
You got to get all
the facts straight.

1270
01:14:56,524 --> 01:14:59,118
You're starting to sound
like your brother.

1271
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,754
Look, we have a deadline here.

1272
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,764
I've told you, this is
the newspaper business.

1273
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,527
We don't have time to
get all the facts.

1274
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,364
We both know the town of
lately set Hillary up.

1275
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:11,530
We've got the story. It's
not the fucking truth!

1276
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:14,336
You want to talk about
the motherfucking truth?

1277
01:15:17,879 --> 01:15:20,871
You thought I was from London?

1278
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,974
Ain't no negro getting
a job up in this spot

1279
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,350
unless he's a colored motherfucking
James Bond, you dig?

1280
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:31,325
I got drunk once and
let ward suck my dick.

1281
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:35,458
He got a taste for niggers
and now he hates himself.

1282
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,895
That's the truth.

1283
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,498
Go back to your brother, boy.

1284
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,667
((British accent) I have
got a deadline to meet.

1285
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:25,704
Hello?

1286
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,341
Put ward on the phone.

1287
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:32,215
Why'd you put his
byline on that article?

1288
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,948
How could you sign
his name on that?

1289
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,013
Tell him we got Hillary out.

1290
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,888
The governor's
gonna pardon him.

1291
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,894
Hillary's getting out.

1292
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:48,554
"I've had some time to think
over the past few months"

1293
01:16:48,603 --> 01:16:52,130
about me, about you.

1294
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,801
I'm not sure I found what
I want out of life yet.

1295
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:58,471
All I know is that I don't
want to live it without you.

1296
01:16:58,546 --> 01:17:01,379
"Please take this ring back.
Love, Jack."

1297
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:10,981
Get the door.

1298
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:17,729
Get the fucking door, bitch!

1299
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:34,940
Who the fuck are you?

1300
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:36,916
I'm Hillary. What you want?

1301
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,612
Get the fuck out!
I'm with Charlotte.

1302
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:40,347
That bitch took my...
I'll call you later!

1303
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:46,286
Charlotte, you want me
to call the police?

1304
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,704
There she is.

1305
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,372
I'm sorry.

1306
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:02,033
I was gonna write
you a letter...

1307
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,476
No, I don't need your letters.
Come here.

1308
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:10,811
Uh...

1309
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,358
Don't touch me.

1310
01:18:19,427 --> 01:18:21,122
Come on here. Don't touch you?

1311
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:24,827
Don't touch you?

1312
01:18:27,468 --> 01:18:29,368
It's okay.

1313
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:31,527
It's all right, baby.

1314
01:18:41,182 --> 01:18:43,514
You want to do
something for me?

1315
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,078
Anything.

1316
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:56,893
That's all right.

1317
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,846
You told me you loved me
in your third letter.

1318
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,943
Do you love me?

1319
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,388
Yes!

1320
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:48,305
You always fuck like this?

1321
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:50,044
Like it was the last time?

1322
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,992
Do you think I'm pretty?

1323
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,550
You fuck those
niggers like this?

1324
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,133
Gonna get all inside here!

1325
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,604
Now pack your shit
and let's go.

1326
01:20:23,017 --> 01:20:26,248
I don't think I'm gonna
like living in a swamp.

1327
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:30,348
I don't want to live in a swamp.
I like it here.

1328
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:37,296
And that was their
declaration of love.

1329
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,095
So Hillary took
Charlotte to the swamp.

1330
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:55,812
So did you hear about
old man Henry? No.

1331
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:58,545
He got drunk in his
back yard by the water,

1332
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:01,611
and the alligators came out and
took a big chunk of his leg.

1333
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,958
Ha. Just joking.

1334
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:08,322
My daddy rooster, he got jumped

1335
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,125
by three of his sons,

1336
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,167
so I need to find a
home for three of them.

1337
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:15,327
So he's in my house sitting,

1338
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,462
so I need... I know
you only have hens.

1339
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:19,972
That's why I was wondering, you
know, if you want to babysit,

1340
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,236
you know, adopt three
of them for you.

1341
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,973
But they'd be good though,
because you have hens. No.

1342
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,448
You're my only hope. No!
I don't want any.

1343
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,814
Come on, Charlotte.

1344
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,682
I need you to do me a favor.

1345
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,346
I need you to post
this thing for me.

1346
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,481
It ain't got a stamp on it.

1347
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:38,149
What's wrong with you today?
It's real important.

1348
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,750
You think you can
do that for me?

1349
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:41,590
You're not acting
yourself today.

1350
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,334
Why's your door open, huh?

1351
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:53,496
Smells like piss in here.

1352
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:56,202
Ward ward said you
might show up.

1353
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:57,608
Left him a note.

1354
01:21:58,946 --> 01:22:00,709
You stink.

1355
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,443
I can smell you from over here.

1356
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,714
Come here, boy. Come sit down.

1357
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,846
What you doing back in Miami?

1358
01:22:11,959 --> 01:22:13,449
Yardley's gone.

1359
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,622
He quit?

1360
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:17,129
No.

1361
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,562
He's in New York.

1362
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:25,397
Signing some book deal.

1363
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:29,637
Hero of the new journalism or
some kind of shit. I don't know.

1364
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,543
W.W. Moved Ellen
into the house, huh?

1365
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:35,811
Whatever.

1366
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:39,377
Whatever makes him happy.

1367
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:09,173
There wasn't no developer, Jack.

1368
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:17,784
All right, let's move.

1369
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,352
Come on, go shower, ward.

1370
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,419
I'm tired.

1371
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:25,692
Come on.

1372
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,603
Jeez.

1373
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,649
I keep thinking I
missed something, Jack.

1374
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:52,021
Like I missed something
I was supposed to see

1375
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:53,720
that was right in front of me.

1376
01:23:53,794 --> 01:23:55,284
Like what?

1377
01:23:58,499 --> 01:24:00,057
The point of it.

1378
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,668
Doesn't matter.

1379
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:07,069
Things got out of hand.

1380
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:09,132
You got hurt,

1381
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,678
yardley got his
fucking book deal.

1382
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:16,008
Hillary got Charlotte
in the swamp.

1383
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:22,816
The idea... is that...
You run the water

1384
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,090
while you're in there with it.

1385
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:26,753
Come on, man.

1386
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:35,432
Hey.

1387
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:45,772
What if we didn't
get it right, huh?

1388
01:24:47,014 --> 01:24:48,504
Makes no difference.

1389
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,175
It makes no difference, Jack?

1390
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,741
You don't know
what it feels like

1391
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,049
to get it exactly right now.

1392
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:57,989
To get it down just
the way it happened.

1393
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,686
You're going back
to see Hillary.

1394
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,284
Fuck yeah, I am.

1395
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:03,956
Do you ever hear from her?

1396
01:25:04,031 --> 01:25:05,362
No.

1397
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,367
Miss bless? No.

1398
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,801
I wonder what she
thinks of him now, huh?

1399
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,066
Can't see her sitting
on the porch stoop

1400
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:16,200
holding a silver spoon

1401
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,745
and waiting for the ice cream
carton to come her way, can you?

1402
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,212
I dug around.

1403
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,718
There wasn't no proof,
no how, nowhere

1404
01:25:25,786 --> 01:25:29,085
that they was ever
stealing sod that night.

1405
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:33,092
They want me to
keep my mouth shut.

1406
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,926
Don't want me to tell my story.
Well, fuck them.

1407
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,762
I'm gonna tell my story.
I'm gonna write my story,

1408
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,928
and they can publish it
wherever the fuck they want to.

1409
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,670
Yeah, mama always
said you better be...

1410
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:59,914
Right and be last before you gonna
be first and be wrong, boy.

1411
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:03,252
Be right and be last before you
go gonna be first and be wrong...

1412
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:04,552
Yeah, I know!

1413
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,375
I heard... They said
things about...

1414
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,477
Oh, yeah. It's all true.

1415
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:36,614
Just kidding. You should
see the other guy.

1416
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,888
Smile. Smile.

1417
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,052
Thank you.

1418
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:49,662
Everyone, please. We
're cutting the cake!

1419
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,227
Where's the photographer?

1420
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,964
Hey, Claire, can you hand me

1421
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,842
that salt over there?

1422
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:58,901
Thank you.

1423
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,080
Hi.

1424
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:06,076
You ain't supposed
to be in here.

1425
01:27:06,153 --> 01:27:07,882
You gonna get me in...
I got you a drink.

1426
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:15,428
You know w. W. Fired me.

1427
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,191
I'm gonna talk to your boss

1428
01:27:17,264 --> 01:27:18,993
and tell him you're a
friend of the family.

1429
01:27:19,066 --> 01:27:20,897
No, Jack. Yeah.

1430
01:27:20,968 --> 01:27:22,868
All I ever did was cook
and clean for you boys.

1431
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,996
I wasn't never no family.

1432
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:28,200
Anyway, go on back outside.

1433
01:27:28,275 --> 01:27:31,676
Well, ward's out there.
You gonna come see him?

1434
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,044
Are you trying to get me fired?

1435
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,412
I miss you.

1436
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,851
I got something for you.
Wait a minute.

1437
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,064
This came for you
about a month ago.

1438
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:55,898
She told him to tell-

1439
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:59,736
she told him not
to let you see it.

1440
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:02,298
"Dear Jack, I can't believe"

1441
01:28:02,376 --> 01:28:05,004
I'm finally writing
you this letter

1442
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:06,637
or if it will get to you

1443
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,512
or whether you'll even read it.

1444
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:12,814
Jack, I think I've really
messed up this time.

1445
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:14,377
Don't misunderstand me.

1446
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,650
Hillary loves me, in his way.

1447
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:18,988
It's just me that isn't
made for this place,

1448
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:21,584
for this lifestyle.

1449
01:28:21,662 --> 01:28:24,495
I hope I can make it to
your father's wedding

1450
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:29,935
so I can hear you tell
me, 'I told you so.

1451
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:34,737
"Take care for now.
Sweetly, your Charlotte."

1452
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,110
Is that from blondie?

1453
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:49,313
Thank you.

1454
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:52,925
Where's your hat?

1455
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:54,688
Oh, I forgot. Get
out of the kitchen.

1456
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:56,525
I'm sorry.

1457
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,656
Excuse me. I'm Jack Jansen.
I'm the groom's son.

1458
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:01,223
My father wants to know what
exactly is taking dinner so long.

1459
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,099
It'll be ready in a minute, sir.
Thank you.

1460
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:05,968
Put the hair under the hat.

1461
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,440
I don't want your black
hair in my food.

1462
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:13,974
You can put your black
hair in my food.

1463
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:20,714
Cheers.

1464
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:27,658
Bye, Anita.

1465
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,570
Bye, Jack.

1466
01:29:57,691 --> 01:29:59,682
You wouldn't leave
without me, would you?

1467
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,820
Drop you off at the motel.
I'm going somewhere.

1468
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,365
Mind me asking where
you're going afterward?

1469
01:30:05,432 --> 01:30:06,694
Going to Charlotte's.

1470
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:08,325
Well, it gotta be tonight?

1471
01:30:08,402 --> 01:30:09,922
I got to get her the
fuck out of there.

1472
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,495
I got to get her out of there!

1473
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:13,199
Charlotte's acting on
her own free will.

1474
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:14,764
What do you want me to say?
Move.

1475
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,366
I got to go to the
van wetters' anyway.

1476
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:18,070
Come with me tomorrow morning.

1477
01:30:18,145 --> 01:30:20,170
We're going now. It
ain't the right time.

1478
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:22,579
Get the fuck out my way. You
ain't driving drunk like this.

1479
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,413
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it, huh?

1480
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,080
What?

1481
01:30:35,462 --> 01:30:37,623
Charlotte must be a
good piece of ass.

1482
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:40,462
You look like a pirate. I know.

1483
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:42,900
Do this for me one time.
Go "aargh."

1484
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:43,595
Uh-huh.

1485
01:30:46,373 --> 01:30:49,137
Hey, you're driving
all squirrelly, man.

1486
01:30:49,209 --> 01:30:51,439
Hey, Jack, sit on down. Hey.

1487
01:30:57,818 --> 01:31:00,252
You sure it's this way?

1488
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,618
I'm sure it's this way.

1489
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:06,988
Ain't a good time to be drinking
too much out here, Jack.

1490
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:10,259
Yeah, you're one to talk.

1491
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,595
Keeping your promise
to dad, did you?

1492
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,327
Not to drink on his big day?

1493
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:17,165
How you holding up?

1494
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:19,831
Let's see your hands.
Are they shaking?

1495
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:24,776
They shaking, ward, huh?
Don't drink.

1496
01:31:24,845 --> 01:31:28,178
Well, why do you take after
the worst of me, Jack?

1497
01:31:30,584 --> 01:31:32,176
'Cause you're my brother.

1498
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:42,490
Wedding party, Charlotte?

1499
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:43,962
I'm going to the wedding.

1500
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,692
Don't be difficult.
I told you...

1501
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:47,427
I don't want you to go.

1502
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,526
No. I told you. I'm
going to the wedding.

1503
01:31:50,704 --> 01:31:51,693
Watch out.

1504
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,040
God, it smells like shit.

1505
01:31:58,879 --> 01:32:02,007
Electric fence. You all right?

1506
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:03,549
You all right?

1507
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:05,881
Goddamn.

1508
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,288
You let me lead.

1509
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:35,945
I don't want to
quarrel with you.

1510
01:32:36,016 --> 01:32:37,677
You're my little pony.

1511
01:32:39,586 --> 01:32:43,044
I just want to climb up
on you one more time.

1512
01:32:55,602 --> 01:32:57,365
I can't believe
she'd live here.

1513
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:09,613
Charlotte!

1514
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,636
Charlotte?

1515
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:49,817
Charlotte!

1516
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,764
What you want?

1517
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,230
She not here.

1518
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:10,299
She gone.

1519
01:34:10,377 --> 01:34:12,675
What is it you
want with my wife?

1520
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:18,346
Huh?

1521
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,320
What is it you
want with my wife?

1522
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:27,184
Just wanted to say hello.

1523
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:30,958
A quick hello and a quick
poke while you're at it?

1524
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:33,022
How about you? What
you up to, ward?

1525
01:34:35,702 --> 01:34:37,431
I know what you came for.

1526
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:42,702
I got what you want.

1527
01:34:42,776 --> 01:34:44,710
Where is she?

1528
01:34:44,778 --> 01:34:47,110
How should I know? I'm not
leaving until I see her.

1529
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:48,648
She not here. She gone.

1530
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:50,976
Let's go. Where?

1531
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:52,211
How should I know?

1532
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:53,810
Last night she told me

1533
01:34:53,887 --> 01:34:55,479
she was going to your
father's wedding!

1534
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:57,387
You're a liar! We
just come from there!

1535
01:34:57,457 --> 01:34:59,550
And that's where you
should go back to, boy!

1536
01:34:59,626 --> 01:35:01,059
He's lying!

1537
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,561
He's lying.

1538
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:04,654
I got this. Go
back to the boat.

1539
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:07,063
Where is she? Where is she?

1540
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:08,624
Stop provoking me, boy,

1541
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:10,226
and do what your
brother tells you!

1542
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:11,828
I said I'm not leaving
until I see her!

1543
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:16,840
Goddamn it, he killed her.

1544
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,673
He killed her, ward.

1545
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:20,838
You killed her!

1546
01:35:20,914 --> 01:35:23,348
You son of a bitch!

1547
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,248
That's all you were good
for is killing her!

1548
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:26,809
Huh?

1549
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:27,911
Run, Jack!

1550
01:35:30,657 --> 01:35:32,921
Come on, boy. Show me.

1551
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:34,483
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1552
01:35:34,561 --> 01:35:36,028
Come on!

1553
01:35:36,096 --> 01:35:37,427
Jack!

1554
01:35:37,497 --> 01:35:38,930
Ward!

1555
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:40,762
Ward!

1556
01:35:40,834 --> 01:35:42,062
Is this what you wanted?

1557
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:46,934
Yeah.

1558
01:35:52,846 --> 01:35:54,507
You got what you come for.

1559
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:58,211
Paperboy.

1560
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,082
Where you going, paperboy?

1561
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,890
Ain't no way out of this one.

1562
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:10,961
Fuck you!

1563
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:36,992
Hillary van wetter was
tried and convicted

1564
01:40:37,063 --> 01:40:40,464
in the murders of Charlotte
bless and ward Jansen.

1565
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:56,505
He died in the electric chair
at the Florida state prison.

1566
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:59,552
Nobody ever found out who
murdered sheriff call.

1567
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:20,602
My little Jack finally saw his
mama again at ward's funeral.

1568
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:22,938
He became a writer
of some renown.

1569
01:41:28,081 --> 01:41:30,948
He never did get over
his first true love.
