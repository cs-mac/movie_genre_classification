875
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:24,434
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Okay.</font></b>

876

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Do you understand English?

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm James Donovan. I'm here

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, Mr. Vogel is our lawyer.</font></b>

897
01:22:39,274 --> 01:22:43,044
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So we were supposed to negotiate, the exchange.</font></b>

899
01:22:45,947 --> 01:22:48,617
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?</font></b>

900
01:22:48,717 --> 01:22:51,738
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It has to be an exchange.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Not here?</font></b>

902

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, no, no. Goodness. My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.</font></b>

904

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He is a German national.</font></b>

909

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Perhaps Mrs. Abel would like to
compose herself privately?</font></b>

910
01:23:42,303 --> 01:23:46,187
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And let Mr. Donovan and myself to talk?</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you.</font></b>

912

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- So, I'm confused.
- Yes.</font></b>

913

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't care who I talk to if it's about
an exchange of personnel.</font></b>

914
01:24:05,894 --> 01:24:09,627
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Are you the person to talk to?

915
01:24:09,727 --> 01:24:14,320
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We should talk. Please, have a seat, Mr. Donovan.</font></b>

916
01:24:15,003 --> 01:24:16,938
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How did you arrive to the Eastern sector?</font></b>

917
01:24:17,038 --> 01:24:20,041
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- The train. The S-Bahn.
- And you were alone?</font></b>

918
01:24:20,141 --> 01:24:21,609
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yeah.</font></b>

919
01:24:21,709 --> 01:24:24,813
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And you are credentialed?</font></b>

920
01:24:24,913 --> 01:24:28,549
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Now, you must know about me, sir.
I'm a private citizen.</font></b>

921
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:30,651
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,</font></b>

922
01:24:30,751 --> 01:24:35,724
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and I've taken time out of my busy schedule
to help my client, Rudolf Abel.</font></b>

923
01:24:35,824 --> 01:24:40,520
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel</font></b>

924
01:24:40,521 --> 01:24:42,662
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">for Francis Gary Powers.</font></b>

925
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:45,979
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is a full pardon of Abel
that will be signed</font></b>

926
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:48,803
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">when the exchange actually takes place.</font></b>

927
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:50,305
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is the only reason I'm here.</font></b>

928
01:24:50,405 --> 01:24:54,342
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.</font></b>

929
01:24:54,442 --> 01:24:57,773
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Abel for Francis Gary Powers...</font></b>

930
01:24:58,313 --> 01:25:01,044
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and Frederic Pryor.</font></b>

931
01:25:02,691 --> 01:25:07,117
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- We don't have Pryor.
- No? You don't?</font></b>

932
01:25:08,723 --> 01:25:11,326
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I've heard of Pryor, but he's held</font></b>

933
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:14,295
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">by the German Democratic Republic,</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">not by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</font></b>

935

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I'll tell you the first problem.</font></b>

936
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:23,805
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The names of your countries are too long.</font></b>

937
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,166
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, yes.</font></b>

938
01:25:28,476 --> 01:25:30,464
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If we release Powers,</font></b>

939
01:25:30,564 --> 01:25:34,611
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">it is only to promote a goodwill
between our countries.</font></b>

940
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:38,949
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So, it cannot be an exchange.</font></b>

941
01:25:41,255 --> 01:25:45,193
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Perhaps...perhaps you could release Abel</font></b>

942
01:25:45,293 --> 01:25:48,746
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">as a token of goodwill to our friends

943
01:25:48,846 --> 01:25:53,120
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">some months later, we would release Powers.
There is an idea.</font></b>

944
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:57,485
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No. That just won't work for us at all. See,
we need this to be an exchange.</font></b>

945
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:00,775
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You can call it what you want,
but an exchange it must be.</font></b>

946
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:04,045
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We can have Abel here within 48 hours.</font></b>

947
01:26:04,145 --> 01:26:08,831
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We need Powers at the same time
we give you Abel.</font></b>

948
01:26:10,717 --> 01:26:12,420
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is...</font></b>

949
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,036
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Can we call this the "impatient plan"?</font></b>

950
01:26:16,457 --> 01:26:19,300
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, you can call it whatever you want.</font></b>

951
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:24,332
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I can relay your impatient plan to Moscow,
see what they say...</font></b>

952
01:26:24,432 --> 01:26:28,870
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But they will wonder why so impatient.</font></b>

953
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:33,374
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Because I have a cold. And I don't live
in Berlin and I want to go home.</font></b>

954
01:26:33,474 --> 01:26:36,817
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They will think, "well, the Americans..."</font></b>

955
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:40,448
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">"must have gotten all the information
that Abel had to give."</font></b>

956
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:43,985
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">"And now they're impatient to trade him,"</font></b>

957
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:47,255
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">"hoping to get in return this man, Powers,"</font></b>

958
01:26:47,355 --> 01:26:52,621
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">"that, perhaps, has not yet given up all
the information that he has to give."</font></b>

959
01:26:53,061 --> 01:26:56,327
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is not an equitable trade, sir.</font></b>

960
01:26:56,864 --> 01:27:00,468
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But what you're saying is, if Powers
has given up everything he knows,</font></b>

961
01:27:00,568 --> 01:27:02,737
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">then Moscow would trade?</font></b>

962
01:27:02,837 --> 01:27:05,273
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why wouldn't they?</font></b>

963
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:08,343
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,</font></b>

964
01:27:08,443 --> 01:27:11,605
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the next Russian operative who gets caught
might think twice</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">about keeping his mouth shut.
And you never know.</font></b>

966
01:27:14,126 --> 01:27:17,886
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Abel might want to see the sky again.</font></b>

967
01:27:18,586 --> 01:27:22,918
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And decide to trade Russian secrets
for small American favors.</font></b>

968
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,662
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How can we know this?</font></b>

969
01:27:27,762 --> 01:27:31,165
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We little men, we just do our jobs.</font></b>

970
01:27:31,265 --> 01:27:34,337
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Like Lieutenant Powers. He's just a pilot.</font></b>

971
01:27:36,537 --> 01:27:38,570
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He was making photographs</font></b>

977
01:27:56,190 --> 01:28:01,198
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We need to have the conversation
our governments can't.</font></b>

978
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,152
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I will ask Moscow.</font></b>
