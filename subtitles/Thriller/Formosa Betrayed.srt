1
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,946
All new FBl agents
are required to recite

2
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,318
an oath as they graduate
from the academy at Quantico.

3
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,148
lt's not just a bunch of words,

4
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,119
it's the reason l joined.

5
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,528
l love America,

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,958
and believe it's worth defending
with my life.

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,324
ln 1983,

8
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,992
the FBl sent me to Taiwan

9
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,469
to assist in the murder investigation
of an United States citizen.

10
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,267
lt was there that l met Ming,

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,239
a man who had endured an injustice

12
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,504
that would force me
to reassess my Constitution,

13
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,045
my belief in the justice system

14
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,309
and the very foundation
of the government in the U.S.

15
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,808
FBl! He's with me.

16
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,758
Officer! Officer!

17
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,268
This American is with the
American lnstitute,

18
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,998
please take him away

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,574
and let me have a few minutes
with him

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,401
to discuss what just happened.

21
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,245
Don't worry, he's not dangerous.

22
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,441
Give us a few minutes, okay?

23
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,418
l just bought you some time.

24
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,722
You ok?

25
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,730
Here. Take that.

26
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,504
What the hell happened?

27
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,705
You start telling me
what is going on right now

28
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,402
or l am not going to be able
to protect you.

29
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,308
Oh come on!

30
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,277
You have no authority here.

31
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,212
This is Taiwan!

32
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,345
And in case you haven't noticed,

33
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,512
l'm the only thing connecting you
to your natural born rights.

34
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,100
Henry Wen's body had all the
earmarks of a mob style killing,

35
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,660
which is why l'm glad
they brought you guys in.

36
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,170
Hey hey! That's a first.

37
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,638
Personally, l think all this
whole rivalry

38
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,038
with the Feds is a bunch of bullshit.

39
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
l just want to catch the bad guys.

40
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,072
l'm with you.

41
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,476
Lisa, l like a straight forward gal.

42
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,844
That's Detective Gilbert,
Agent Braxton.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,745
We discovered an abnormality
in the X-Ray.

44
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,049
His throat was scratched,

45
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,728
most of our examinations
are fairly straight forward.

46
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,925
This was an exception.

47
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,059
We pulled this from his trachea.

48
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,569
ls it Chinese?

49
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,866
Taiwanese actually.

50
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,339
l thought it might be a connection
to the lron Blood Patriots,

51
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,569
a Taiwanese gang with known
affiliates here in the U.S.

52
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,270
lron Blood Patriots?

53
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,471
Yeah.

54
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,048
And this was found here
at the crime scene.

55
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,585
These cigarettes are unavailable
for purchase here in the States.

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,086
l thought the evidence suggested

57
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,384
something somewhat
outside of my jurisdiction.

58
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,186
Could very well be Detective.

59
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,900
Henry Wen was a
professor of Economics.

60
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,778
This is what they're
teaching these days?

61
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,779
Not your run of the mill course study.

62
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,816
You find anything linking him
to the Taiwanese mob?

63
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,084
No, neither at the house.

64
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,557
And his widow was very helpful,

65
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,595
which is certainly not typical
of a mob related crime.

66
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,266
They killed him

67
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,763
because of his work.

68
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,868
There were spies,

69
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,676
watching him.

70
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,176
Any insight from the university?

71
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,544
We interviewed his fellow
professors and students.

72
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,484
He was well liked and respected,

73
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,988
he taught economics and apparently
he was writing a book.

74
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,658
What was the book about?

75
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,159
No one seems to know.

76
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,226
Or at least
that's what they're saying.

77
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,633
ln fact, we were just celebrating
Henry's tenure the night he was killed.

78
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,843
Coming into this country
as a young man,

79
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,842
an expert in number theory

80
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,541
and now being honored with tenure
in what l feel is record time.

81
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,549
To a man with great integrity,

82
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,019
may we look ahead to many
wonderful years.

83
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,851
Let's raise our glasses,

84
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,986
for Professor Henry Wen!

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,593
And when will we get to hear about
the wonderful new book Henry?

86
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,330
What book?

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,415
He was very well known in
the Chinese community,

88
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,312
their newspapers, etcetera.

89
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,920
Can you think of any reason why
someone might want to kill him?

90
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,319
Apparently, he was a very
outspoken critic

91
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,656
of the current
government in Taiwan.

92
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,123
l can't imagine Henry's
economic theories

93
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,359
provoking anything more than
esoteric argument.

94
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,128
But his wife suggested something?

95
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,896
She thought he was being spied on.

96
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,768
Well, maybe she was scared
shitless of this mob.

97
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:49,940
She was frightened.

98
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,101
Well, l'd say
that's understandable.

99
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,505
She did mention two
suspicious characters

100
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,808
who were hanging out across
from her house at the park,

101
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,610
and this was confirmed
by a neighbor.

102
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,823
l saw two guys in hooded
sweatshirts on bikes.

103
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,321
Anything more specific?

104
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,289
They looked Oriental.

105
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,395
l couldn't see them very well,

106
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,259
but they would sit on their bikes
right over there smoking cigarettes.

107
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,296
l saw them twice,

108
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,901
both times as l was going to
work in the morning.

109
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,933
lt just looks like the
work of amateurs.

110
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,700
Yeah, or made to look that way. What do
you think they were looking for?

111
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,503
And did they find it.

112
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,724
How are you getting along?

113
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
On some level,

114
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,759
l have been preparing for this
for many years.

115
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,159
But l am only now beginning to realize

116
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,269
that you cannot prepare
for something like this.

117
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,608
We knew each other our whole lives.

118
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:06,514
l attended a wedding at the
Ambassador many years ago.

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,317
l was a teenager.

120
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,257
lt was where l met my husband.

121
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,967
You might want to talk to the groom,

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,470
tell him l send my regards

123
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,772
and hope he is well.

124
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,820
Mrs. Wen was in the car when
the whole thing happened,

125
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,496
but she wasn't harmed.

126
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,259
They didn't touch her.

127
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,592
lt's awfully brazen.

128
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,636
They didn't seem to be concerned
with getting caught or identified.

129
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,841
The Wen's were the last ones to
leaving the building that evening.

130
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,454
Wen Ming Hwa?

131
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,846
Yes?

132
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,706
Ming Hwa! Ming Hwa!
Ming Hwa! Ming Hwa!

133
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,017
Help me! Someone help me!

134
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,285
Ming Hwa? Ming Hwa?

135
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,363
No! No!

136
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,275
The meeting with Mrs.
Wen had stayed with me.

137
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,338
l can't imagine what that
must have been like.

138
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,941
lt's not often that a witness to
a murder is spared.

139
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,119
Why didn't they kill her?

140
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,908
l think this way of going about
it is the right way.

141
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,743
l think that is him, excuse me.

142
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,113
Agent Kelly?

143
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,308
Yes.

144
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,418
Susan Kane, l'm the
American liaison here,

145
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,109
how you doing?

146
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:54,947
Fine, how are you?

147
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:55,849
Please take them.

148
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,455
Let him take your bag.

149
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,953
So how was that flight?

150
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,423
-lt was good.
-Long huh?

151
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,928
We can get you settled into the hotel

152
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,325
and you can get some rest.

153
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,495
Agent Kelly, this is Mr. Kuo,

154
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,328
he's our liaison with
the government here.

155
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,902
Welcome to the Republic
of China Agent Kelly,

156
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,530
it's an honor to have you here
and the participation of the FBl.

157
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,540
lf there's anything l can do

158
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,042
to make your stay here
more productive,

159
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,373
please, do not hesitate to ask.

160
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,640
Thank you.

161
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,376
Superintendent Loh
of the police prefecture.

162
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,913
And Officer Chen of the
Taiwan Bureau of lnvestigation.

163
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,783
He's going to be your point person in
your assisting of the investigation.

164
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,290
We are looking forward
to your expertise

165
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,292
in finding the killers of Professor Wen.

166
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,464
-How dare you!
-Take him away!

167
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,105
All right gentlemen, shall we?

168
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,707
l'm sorry you had to see that.

169
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,141
Communist spy.

170
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,610
You can imagine all the problems
we have here.

171
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,475
Agent Kelly,

172
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,741
we have planned some
wonderful events for your visit.

173
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,373
At dinner tonight you will meet everyone

174
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,712
that is going to be
relying on your knowledge

175
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,184
and we have some excellent seats

176
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,345
to the ballet and orchestra.

177
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,252
Well, unfortunately,
l'm not here on vacation.

178
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,517
Well of course, work is important.

179
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,854
But this country has much to offer!

180
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,510
Whew, that's better.

181
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,110
l've been here four months and l'm
still not used to the humidity.

182
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,883
Never been through a
Chicago summer l take it.

183
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,348
Hey, l'm a California girl.

184
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,448
Ah, you need to pick your
assignments better.

185
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,218
Enjoy your stay Mr. Kelly.

186
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,416
Thank you.

187
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,684
You all set?

188
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,846
All set.

189
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,452
So, we'll send a car to pick you up
about 6:30 for the dinner,

190
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,561
and l'm going to recommend
that you take a nap.

191
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,197
l mean, these affairs tend to
be rather long

192
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,162
and believe me, its going to be hard
to leave early.

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,131
You know, l just need to
wash up for a bit

194
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,533
and then l'd love to get to
the Bureau office.

195
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:30,699
lf l may, we go to the dinner tonight,
have a couple of drinks,

196
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,370
get to know everybody a little bit.

197
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,377
You break through the formality here
and these doors just open .

198
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,548
When in Rome.

199
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,778
Exactly, when in Rome.

200
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,980
All right, thanks.

201
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,385
Get some rest!

202
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Hello, National Palace Museum -

203
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,926
Yeah, l'm sorry,
do you speak English?

204
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:32,935
Yes.

205
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,165
Terrific, is this the
National Palace Museum?

206
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,467
Yes.

207
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,543
l'm calling to talk to
Dr. Huang Li Pei.

208
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,939
Dr. Huang is out.

209
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,775
Dr. Huang, sorry. Do you know
when he'll be back?

210
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,180
He's gone for the rest of the day,
would you like to leave a message?

211
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,186
No, that's all right, l will call him
back myself. Thank you very much.

212
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,311
Bye.

213
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,321
Taiwanese beer for you,
straight whiskey for me,

214
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,427
never even liked this stuff
before l got here.

215
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,858
When in Rome.

216
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,735
You know sometimes l think
this government

217
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,671
spends more of our money
on entertainment than defense.

218
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,106
Agent Kelly, Susan.

219
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,645
Did you find
time to see some of our city?

220
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,146
Unfortunately, l didn't
get out of the hotel.

221
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,750
As you can imagine,
l'm itching to get to work.

222
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,755
l think we're called to dinner.
l hope you guys are hungry!

223
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,053
Cheers!

224
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,854
Please drink!

225
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,623
Wow, l should be honored.

226
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,825
Oh, there's plenty more
where that came from.

227
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,258
Can't wait.

228
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,843
Hope you enjoyed your
evening Agent Kelly,

229
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,745
it was a great success.

230
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,976
Good night.

231
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,449
Thank you. Good night.

232
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:39,881
Taiwan lndependence!
Taiwan lndependence!

233
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:44,921
We want murderer!

234
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,855
We want truth!

235
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,190
We want murderer!

236
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,458
What's with the bags?
Bold fashion statement?

237
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,295
Or a political statement.

238
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,392
Or maybe they just
don't want to be identified.

239
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,834
Oh yeah, maybe they're the killers.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,738
l mean, it's not like you can tell these
people apart anyway without the bags.

241
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,076
You are an asshole.

242
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,312
The bill they pulled from Wen's throat,

243
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,848
the Chinese mafia, when they make
a hit they leave a little bit of money

244
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,683
behind to pay off
the ghost of the victim.

245
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,483
That's very thoughtful.

246
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,922
l'm having a hard time seeing this
guy as some kind of gangster.

247
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,931
Well trust me, as you limp towards
retirement, it's gonna get easier.

248
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,226
We had a lot of calls come in,
we should go.

249
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,084
Now we're just wrapping up,

250
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,479
what about you? You find anything?

251
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,989
Just a monthly wire transfer
of $1000 bucks a pop.

252
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:54,922
You're kidding me.

253
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,425
Crime ain't funny Jake.

254
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,587
Well, why didn't you tell me this
from the start of the conversation?

255
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,858
Because the recipient is,
drum roll please,

256
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,027
the Presbyterian Church of Taipei.

257
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,935
Yeah, this mob connection thing,
you're right, it's a little thin.

258
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,370
Well, keep working it.

259
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,705
l appreciate and value
your years of experience.

260
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,639
lt's a good thing Braxton's not here,
he hates Chinese.

261
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,078
You gotta be kidding me.

262
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,512
How many calls have be gotten?

263
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,315
Hundreds, most of them worthless.

264
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,889
Any of them jump out at you?

265
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,652
Maybe. We got a call from
a convenience store owner,

266
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,092
he says two Asian guys come in and
as they're leaving, he's not sure,

267
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,824
but he thinks that they're driving
a brown Cutlass Sierra.

268
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:34,933
Okay, where was this?

269
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,592
-Brigmar and Ciscero.
-That's six blocks from the University.

270
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,600
Right.

271
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,830
So l do a little research
and l find out

272
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,806
the most commonly rented car
from O'Hare is a Cutlass Sierra.

273
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,534
By using the cigarette butts as a guide,

274
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,908
l make a short list of everybody
who arrives from Taiwan and China

275
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,275
who rents a Sierra.

276
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,074
Nice work.

277
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,548
Don't get too excited,
the list isn't that short.

278
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,149
So, what do we got?

279
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,257
Okay, so l just got a call
from a motel manager,

280
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,519
he says two Chinese guys
checked in the other day,

281
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,859
they don't speak very good English
and they're driving a Sierra.

282
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:07,999
-Wait, that's the motel?
-Right.

283
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,122
-That's the convenience store?
-Uh huh.

284
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,098
And that's the University?

285
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:10,929
Right off the expressway.

286
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,627
That's worth checking out.

287
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,222
Hi, l'm Detective Gilbert from
Chicago Police Department.

288
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,623
You called in about two Chinese man.

289
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,094
Oh, uh huh.

290
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,931
That's them.

291
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,474
David Wu. James Lee.

292
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,837
They're in room 36.

293
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,973
No Cutlass Sierra.

294
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,301
Clear.

295
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,434
Take a look around here.
l'll check back.

296
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,413
Lisa, there's two bikes back here.
Let's get some back up.

297
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,782
Lisa, do you copy?

298
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,654
Lisa, do you copy?

299
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,486
Freeze police!

300
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,655
Stop! FBl!

301
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,916
lt's clear, it's clear.

302
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,979
This is Agent Kelly, FBl.
Shots fired, officer down.

303
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,422
4229 West Ciscero and 36th.

304
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,318
So, did you find anything?

305
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,291
lt doesn't hurt that much actually.

306
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:57,926
They're in Taipei!

307
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,735
The Cutlass Sierra was
found this morning

308
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,706
in an abandoned tire factory
on the south side.

309
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,671
She was right.

310
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,375
Who?

311
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,339
Lisa.

312
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:09,106
The car was rented from O'Hare two days
before Wen was killed, by James Lee.

313
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,478
The same James Lee bought a
ticket to Taipei, paid cash for it.

314
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,209
The second ticket was for David Wu.

315
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,319
So these guys flew out of O'Hare?

316
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,853
Passport Control had these sketches?

317
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,355
How the hell did they get out?

318
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,199
Anything from the locals?

319
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,302
Nothing, they believe that
these are false identities.

320
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,529
lnterpol?

321
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,670
Same.

322
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,933
And l've got the Senator
in charge of sub-committee

323
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,600
on Asian Affairs crawling
up my ass on this.

324
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,771
Seems he's making the
Professor his pet project.

325
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,212
Wants to turn this into
a god damed press event

326
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,615
because this murder
was of a U.S. citizen

327
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,983
and especially because
the suspects crossed the border.

328
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,612
Made in Taiwan.

329
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,722
Yeah.

330
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,392
But, seeing as how we don't have an
official relationship with them anymore,

331
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,933
we can't extradite anyway.

332
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,035
So State is telling me
that we are being

333
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:15,170
allowed one emissary to observe and
possibly assist in their investigation.

334
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,337
Why're you looking at me?

335
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,311
You're senior.

336
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,782
And when l left 'Nam l pissed out
the door of that chopper.

337
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,614
You can send me Europe.

338
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,819
So, how's your Chinese Kelly?

339
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,726
Um, nonexistent sir.

340
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,057
Well, tough, because you're up at bat.

341
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:31,753
Okay.

342
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,129
Now just remember, you're
being invited to assist.

343
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,428
What does that mean?

344
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,895
Don't be a cowboy.
Let them do their jobs.

345
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,001
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,176
Braxton.

347
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,180
Hey, it's Jake.

348
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,718
Hey, how's it going? Hey,
sick of the food yet?

349
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,118
Let's just say these people
like to drink.

350
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,016
l would too if l lived in a
fucking police state.

351
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,719
Yeah, me too.
But don't tell anybody.

352
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,123
So, what'd you find out.

353
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,029
Nothing. Going in to lD
some photos tomorrow.

354
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,224
Tomorrow?

355
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,595
These people don't seem
to view the case

356
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,566
with the same urgency we do.

357
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,695
l'll call you tomorrow after
l actually get to work.

358
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,808
Okay, don't forget. l worry about you.

359
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,073
Bye, Tom.

360
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,568
Bye.

361
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,978
They're going to take
Lee's body away

362
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,746
and the military police are going
to come back through that door

363
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,843
and they're going to throw
you ass in jail or worse.

364
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,856
So you tell me right now,
who gave you Lee?

365
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,520
Can you arrange
an unconditional release?

366
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,890
No.

367
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,893
There's nothing unconditional here.

368
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,764
Then all you're going to get from me
is name, rank and serial number.

369
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,003
Hello? How are you?

370
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,573
Hello, do you speak English?

371
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,505
Yes.

372
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,838
l'm calling to speak with
Dr. Huang Li Pei.

373
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,412
Who is calling?

374
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,579
This is Jake Kelly,

375
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,809
please tell him Mrs. Wen
suggested l call.

376
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:01,677
This is Huang.

377
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,655
Dr. Huang, this is Agent Jake Kelly
of the FBl.

378
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,694
l'm in Taipei assisting in the investigation
of the murder of Wen Ming Hwa.

379
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,161
A terrible tragedy.

380
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,157
Mrs. Wen asked me to
give you her regards.

381
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,497
Are you hungry, Agent Kelly?

382
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:20,830
Hungry?

383
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,769
You eat breakfast don't you?

384
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,270
l can recommend an
excellent restaurant.

385
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,306
Leave the hotel, walk 5 blocks.
The restaurant is on your right.

386
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,646
Thank you.

387
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,021
Dr. Huang?

388
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,189
Guess not.

389
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,426
What do you want to eat?

390
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,864
Uh, l.

391
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,664
What do you want to eat? Eat?

392
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,034
Um. l'm sorry, l don't,

393
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:29,799
do you speak English?

394
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,603
What do you want eat? Eat?

395
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,507
No, thank you.

396
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,635
You can't sit here

397
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,747
if you're not ...

398
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:42,046
Okay, coffee? Coffee. Coffee?

399
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,128
Don't.

400
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,234
lt isn't me! lt isn't me!

401
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,003
Help me! lt isn't me!

402
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,940
Please don't!

403
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,275
Hey, wait!

404
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,395
Hey!

405
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,098
You speak English?

406
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,396
Please, sir. Calm.

407
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,996
You know Dr. Huang?

408
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,839
He only ask you pay your bill.

409
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,220
First, we'll give you what we have on
known gang members here in Taiwan.

410
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,548
By the way you found Henry Wen

411
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,388
we believe he was assassinated by a
group called the lron Blood Patriots.

412
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,520
They are very well represented
in various U.S. cities,

413
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,896
facilitating stolen electronics
and drugs from the region.

414
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,868
And your Professor Wen,
he was a well known

415
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,463
boss of another gang,
the Bamboo Tigers.

416
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,733
Really?

417
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,839
Professor Wen was a
well respected academic.

418
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,937
We're having a tough time
picturing him as a mob boss.

419
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,280
As you can imagine, it's easier for us

420
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,181
to infiltrate these groups
than it would be for you.

421
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:58,745
Unless the Bureau is actively recruiting
native speakers of Taiwanese these days?

422
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,148
Please.

423
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,389
lf you got a good look at the assassin,
l assure you, you'll find him here.

424
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,531
Someone once said, be careful
for what you wish.

425
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,798
Well, right now l wish for
a pot of coffee.

426
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,806
Pour him a cup of coffee.

427
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,499
Well Agent Kelly,

428
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,497
what new information
do you have for us?

429
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,237
They're not here. No James Lee,
no David Wu.

430
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:59,584
That is impossible. This is the combined
work of 3 security agencies on the island.

431
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,517
Every gang member in Taiwan
would be in these books.

432
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,448
Sorry.

433
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,086
l think you've made an inaccurate lD.

434
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,362
He was as close to me
as you are right now.

435
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,659
And l'd have no trouble lDing you.

436
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,966
Agent Kelly!

437
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,736
How was your first day?

438
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,938
Mr. Kuo.

439
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:26,174
He says he didn't find the
suspect in any of our files.

440
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:26,902
Really?

441
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,808
Well, Agent Kelly must be right.

442
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,780
We'll cross check everything to make
sure no one has fallen through the cracks.

443
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,586
l'll go immediately now to get it done.

444
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,982
Yes, please go.

445
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,117
Now in the meantime Agent Kelly,

446
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,194
you've earned some serious R & R.

447
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,526
l know some place special
for me to take you.

448
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,131
Really special.

449
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,033
Come on.

450
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,636
Sounds good.

451
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,634
We have a private room for dinner,

452
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,108
then l'm going to introduce
to you some VlPs.

453
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,611
You're going to be in very
exclusive company Agent Kelly.

454
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,310
Very few people get to
see a party's inner sanctum.

455
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,955
Just me and the ClA spooks
there at the table, huh?

456
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,352
You guys are great.

457
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,454
You have some imagination
Agent Kelly.

458
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,895
l suppose in your line of work
it comes in handy. Come on.

459
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,594
So, who else would
rate to come in here?

460
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:31,270
Businessmen, representatives of your
Boeing or Lockheed perhaps.

461
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,001
You take good care of
my friend, okay?

462
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,082
lf you will excuse me, l'm going
to check the kitchen.

463
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,879
They make a very, very good
New York steak. Cheers.

464
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,009
Cheers.

465
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,524
Thank God for that guy, right?

466
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,786
You here on business?

467
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,121
Yeah.

468
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,592
Well, then you know what l mean.

469
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,762
Did you know
there's hundreds of missiles

470
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:00,098
being pointed at us right now
from China?

471
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,767
Ah, no l didn't.

472
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,000
And for what? Christ,

473
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,404
the Reds are already going to
get Hong Kong back.

474
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,844
With the Brits in charge,
that's for sure.

475
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,543
But that guy right there,

476
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,680
that guy right there is the only thing
keeping Taiwan safe for making money.

477
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,419
And democracy.

478
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,657
Yeah, that too.

479
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,891
That too buddy.

480
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:29,926
Cheers.

481
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,228
Cheers.

482
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,901
Yes, operator, l would like to
call the United States please.

483
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,769
Thank you.

484
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,643
Braxton.

485
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,510
lt's me.

486
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,243
Hey! How's it going,
you sound tired.

487
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,283
l am.

488
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,150
Yeah? Too much partying over there
or did they finally put you to work?

489
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,749
Yeah. Except it turns out their complete
records weren't exactly complete.

490
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,124
No kidding.
So, now what do you do?

491
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,125
Show up tomorrow,
they pull more files.

492
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,991
Sounds like fun.

493
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,432
What's that noise?
You got somebody coming up?

494
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,403
You got a girl coming up
over there or something?

495
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,806
Yeah, several. l'll call you tomorrow.

496
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,507
Hello.

497
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,077
May l help you?

498
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,915
l always wanted to meet an FBl agent.

499
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:06,062
Consider my friendship as a token
of our President's appreciation.

500
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,227
Please tell Mr. Kuo thank you
but, no thanks.

501
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,201
You don't find me attractive?

502
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,672
l find you very attractive.

503
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,366
l find you very sexy Agent.

504
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,004
Don't use your phone,
they're listening.

505
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,544
Who's listening?

506
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,643
Get angry. Throw me out.

507
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,749
Meet me in the alley in ten minutes.

508
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,622
Get out.

509
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,052
You don't like girls?

510
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,924
l don't like whores.

511
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,559
Get out!

512
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,796
How the hell did you think
you were going to

513
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,104
get a known felon in Taiwan
on a plane to the States?

514
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,574
That's why l called you!

515
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,111
l don't work for you and
l don't have unlimited powers.

516
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,908
-You wanna talk to the Ambassador
-Bullshit! Don't give me that!

517
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,641
you head across the Taiwan
Strait and go up to Beijing!

518
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,150
No, the government here
is highly dependent on ours!

519
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,015
No, the government here,
and ours l might add,

520
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,679
are only concerned with
making sure this island

521
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,621
doesn't become subject
to a Communist takeover.

522
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,157
And that's it.

523
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,921
Oh, come on! l don't buy for
one second that you believe that.

524
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,224
You're not stupid and you're not naive!

525
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,293
How does arresting me prevent
a Communist takeover, huh?

526
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,994
Where you going with this?

527
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:28,935
Were you followed?

528
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,603
No.

529
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,907
-Are you sure?
-Yes, l'm sure.

530
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,413
All right, it's dangerous here.

531
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,710
Who are you?

532
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,786
My name is Maysing.
Dr. Huang sent me,

533
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,786
okay? Let's go.

534
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,984
Maysing, who are you afraid of?
What's going on?

535
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,987
Did you enjoy your dinner tonight,
Agent Kelly?

536
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,432
Did they keep your drink full?

537
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,501
So, what're you saying?

538
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,805
They received a tip on Wu Da-Wei,

539
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,308
his name is David Wu in your country.
They know where he's hiding

540
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,968
and they are already making their move.

541
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,740
Come. We're close.

542
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,922
He's in the last room on the first floor.

543
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,461
FBl!

544
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,068
-FBl Agent!
-Stop!

545
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,573
What is he doing here?

546
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,915
Why wasn't l called about this?

547
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,010
Take him away!

548
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,247
-Away immediately!
-You can't do this!

549
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,819
Shit!

550
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,349
What were you thinking?

551
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,391
lt was a take down.

552
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,761
l thought l should at least be advising.

553
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,535
Christ. You could have
been shot on site

554
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,002
and then l'd really have a mess
on my hands, wouldn't l?

555
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:40,210
This morning they have no idea
who David Wu is.

556
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,311
Less than twenty four hours later

557
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,108
they're staging a major raid with half
the Taiwanese army to assassinate him.

558
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,444
This is not a conspiracy.

559
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,183
No.

560
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,220
No, its mob theory they keep
pushing down my throat.

561
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,948
The gangs here are very well connected

562
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,753
and unfortunately we have almost
no control over corruption.

563
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,863
Henry Wen was not a gangster.

564
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,396
We're outsiders here.

565
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,692
They do things differently

566
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,165
and they're not going to let us
in on the inside.

567
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,233
The military maintains an awfully
high profile here.

568
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,545
Well, they've been in a state of
martial law since '47.

569
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,707
l think it's very difficult for us to
understand constant threat of invasion.

570
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,877
The threat of a Communist
takeover. Very hard.

571
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,692
Front desk.
May l help you Mr. Kelly?

572
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,998
Mr. Kelly? Hello?

573
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,148
The phone's been ringing off the
hook for three hours.

574
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,255
Let me guess, Susan Kane?

575
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,288
Washington.

576
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,049
Washington?

577
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,988
Yeah, l mean, l didn't know
you had it in you

578
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,528
but you're apparently kicking
up a shit storm over there.

579
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,790
Tom, l'm telling you, they had 30 guys
between him and door and they shot him.

580
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,092
lt's their show!

581
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,668
Yeah, and they're taking me out to
dinner while the raids going down.

582
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,668
You're only there to assist.

583
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,933
How am l supposed to assist if
they're killing the suspects?

584
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,136
Tell you something bigger is going
on here. l'll know more soon, l think.

585
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,339
Yeah well, when you know,
be sure to let us know.

586
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,710
l gotta go.

587
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,233
Why am l not surprised?

588
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,267
l'm glad you do not dismiss
a lowly waiter, Agent Kelly.

589
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,634
l am Ming.

590
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,042
Dr. Huang is here?

591
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,038
l will take you to him.

592
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,910
So you knew Professor Wen?

593
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,552
No, l didn't know him.
Chicago's a big place.

594
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,983
And what did you know about him?

595
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,018
He seemed very well liked.

596
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,786
His wife was very nice.

597
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,933
There was a big demonstration
on campus protesting his death.

598
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,867
And this demonstration, what
was it trying to say?

599
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,666
lt was trying to connect his
death to your government.

600
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,235
Does that seem impossible to you?

601
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,052
Well, l know about his affiliation
with the Bamboo Tigers Gang.

602
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,888
You really must speak with
Dr. Huang.

603
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,294
How does arresting me prevent a
Communist takeover?

604
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,265
Where are you going with this?

605
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,844
Why were you meeting with
Dr. Huang? Hm?

606
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,151
Huang was Wen's mentor. Wen's
widow wanted me to say hi.

607
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,754
So you went all the way down
to Kaohsiung to say hi?

608
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,253
lf l tell you, can you get them to
release Ming to me?

609
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,964
l can talk to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

610
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,226
Not good enough.

611
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,861
You know what, let me
tell you something.

612
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,995
This isn't just some little investigation
you can control at your field office.

613
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,437
l don't think you understand
exactly what's going on here.

614
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,905
Yeah,

615
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,476
do you?

616
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,337
How is Mrs. Wen?

617
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,114
Under the circumstances, she
seems like a very strong woman.

618
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:57,926
When l last saw her, she was
a shy, beautiful bride.

619
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:03,630
Wen was very happy.
His was a terrible loss.

620
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,662
Are you close to finding his murderers?

621
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:10,302
Unfortunately, l seem to be
somewhat outside of the investigation.

622
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,565
They're not giving me much to go on.

623
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,811
This is very frustrating l'm sure.

624
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,771
So, who would want to
kill Henry Wen?

625
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,815
Are the police telling you
the mob is responsible?

626
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,285
Yes. And l don't think Henry Wen
had anything to do with the mob.

627
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:30,585
l'm proud of my student Henry Wen.
He did what l could not do.

628
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,522
What's that?

629
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,165
He made the ultimate sacrifice.

630
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,366
He left his country in order to
make it better for his people.

631
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:45,069
Being in your country, a free country,
he could speak freely.

632
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,273
What do you know of
our country's history?

633
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,277
Under Japanese occupation
until the end of World War ll.

634
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,915
Then when Chiang Kai-Shek and his army
were forced out of China by Mao Zedong

635
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,851
he established control here.

636
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,154
He's been protecting Taiwan
from the Communist invasion

637
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,284
from mainland China ever since.

638
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,091
l guess that information has been
approved by your State Department.

639
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,197
This island has been controlled
by foreigners for a long time.

640
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,636
To establish control Chiang Kai-Shek
imposed martial law.

641
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:26,646
lt didn't matter that people here
were harassed, arrested, tortured.

642
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,515
lt didn't matter that people here
were forced to speak Mandarin.

643
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:35,019
We were fined for speaking our
own language, Taiwanese.

644
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:39,285
ln America, Wen was
able to write about all these things.

645
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,796
There are eighteen million native
Taiwanese on this island,

646
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,628
but about two million mainland
Chinese rule them.

647
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:52,070
And the minute your President Nixon
shook the hand of Chairman Mao,

648
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:58,175
the government saw their days were
numbered. They are desperate.

649
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,480
Desperate enough to kill an
American on America soil?

650
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,481
Kill the chicken, to scare the monkey.

651
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,480
Kill the chicken, to scare the monkey.

652
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:16,193
Fear made us lose our awareness.
lt can turn us into cowards as well.

653
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,927
l do not wish to offend you
Agent Kelly.

654
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,762
But you might ask yourself why
your government sent you here.

655
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,801
You do not seem to be
an expert on Taiwan.

656
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,275
l was the only one who could
identify Wen's killer.

657
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,870
But they already know who
killed Professor Wen.

658
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:36,745
But what's important is we all can
say we did what was right.

659
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,280
And l owe this to Wen.

660
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:51,697
Taiwan lndependence!
Taiwan lndependence!

661
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,427
We must finish Wen's work.

662
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,539
Come on.

663
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:24,033
Taiwan lndependence!
Taiwan lndependence!

664
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:29,063
Today we are here for our Formosa

665
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:33,836
Our Taiwan. We are not afraid of...

666
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:38,371
Wen sent this to me. Now you
will reveal its contents.

667
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,012
You don't want to give that to me.

668
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,610
lf you were to give me evidence
l'd have to turn it in.

669
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,589
We all have to believe in
something, Agent Kelly.

670
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:55,022
l choose to believe, as did Henry,
in the ideals of the United States.

671
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,330
What about you?

672
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,334
Aren't you worried about what's
going to happen to you?

673
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:12,672
l am the chief curator of the greatest
collection of Chinese art in the world.

674
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,285
l am thus useful to the government.

675
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,222
lf l were not, l would not
have been here to meet you.

676
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:26,995
Finally, l too am doing the right thing.

677
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,561
Thank you Agent Kelly.

678
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,767
Thank you.

679
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:35,972
Ming.

680
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,404
Thank you very much, Dr. Huang.

681
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,167
Be careful.

682
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,006
Bye.

683
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:48,278
Taiwan lndependence!
Taiwan lndependence!

684
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:52,616
All the fellow Taiwanese, the masters
of our Formosa, we stand up today...

685
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,748
They are speaking in Taiwanese,
not Chinese.

686
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,827
For democracy and
freedom of Taiwan,

687
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,522
With courage, we stand here today

688
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,333
What's two-two-eight?

689
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,435
February 28, 1947.

690
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:14,135
Chiang Kai-Shek's army killed twenty
thousand Taiwanese in one week.

691
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,437
lt's illegal to talk about.

692
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,074
What are they saying?

693
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,174
lndependence!

694
00:50:22,753 --> 00:51:05,590
Taiwan lndependence!
Taiwan lndependence!

695
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,545
Don't be panic.

696
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,380
Sit down! Everyone sit down.

697
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,645
Let's stay together.

698
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,276
You and Dr. Huang talked for
what twenty minutes apparently.

699
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,719
So you knew l was being followed.

700
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:18,157
This isn't the U.S. You're a visitor
going outside of your directives.

701
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,352
Well, you're not much of an agent if
you don't know you've been watched

702
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,623
since the moment you got here.

703
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,754
Who's side are you on?

704
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,890
l could as you the same question.

705
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,094
You're withholding evidence,
aiding a Communist spy.

706
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,762
What is this?
A government briefing now?

707
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,306
Military command briefed me
as a courtesy.

708
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,774
All right, let's cut through the bull then.
Why don't you tell me what you know.

709
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,401
All right, here's what l know,

710
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,845
an emissary of the United States was
seen at an anti-government rally.

711
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:40,881
That doesn't look too good.

712
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:45,249
This government ordered its army to
fire into a group of unarmed civilians

713
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,219
who were trying to stage a
peaceful protest.

714
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,018
How does that look?

715
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,668
l'm going to get back to the hotel.

716
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,497
lt's late. Please stay.

717
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,606
Oh, no it's...

718
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,239
Let me get some tea.

719
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,562
l can't believe the army could fire
on a crowd like that.

720
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
They were ordered to do so.

721
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,669
Why?

722
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:45,848
lt was a pro-democracy rally. The
government needs no publicity about 228.

723
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,618
They have done such a good job

724
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,418
that no one outside
this island knows about it.

725
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,722
That is why we suspect they
killed Henry Wen.

726
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,633
He was trying to expose it
to the rest of the world.

727
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,330
What happened?

728
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:19,647
After World War ll, the Japanese
left after fifty years.

729
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,408
We were very happy.

730
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:28,350
Then the Chinese Civil War started.
Chiang Kai Shek's army

731
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,154
began to lose against Mao Zedong's
army and the Communists.

732
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,824
Chiang's army started
coming to Taiwan.

733
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:42,504
At first, we were happy because most
of our ancestors are from the mainland.

734
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:50,071
But then, we began to realize why
they were losing the war.

735
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:53,348
lt was because they stole from
people on the mainland

736
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,213
in the same way they would
steal from us.

737
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,313
They came to Taiwan and saw
how rich we were.

738
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,727
And they acted
like they owned everything.

739
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,893
On February 28, 1947,

740
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:21,568
we native Taiwanese got together
and demanded for justice and order.

741
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:29,378
They responded by sending a
battalion to kill us.

742
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:35,252
They were very specific about
who they killed.

743
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:42,722
They killed politicians, businessmen,
journalists, intellectuals,

744
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:50,204
anybody who could create a government.
An entire generation of leaders.

745
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,114
My father was a civil engineer.

746
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,775
He was taken from my house

747
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,486
and dragged to the river

748
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:14,061
with five other unlucky men.
They were tied together,

749
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:25,607
they shot one of them in the head and he
dragged the four others down with him.

750
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,939
My father was the last to drown.

751
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,890
You should drink your tea,

752
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,357
it's a healing tea.

753
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:06,040
The Chinese say we are their brothers,

754
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,417
but if we are brothers,
why do they treat us like this?

755
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,477
Thank you.

756
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,775
Sweetie.

757
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,377
Come here, don't bother our guest.

758
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,851
No, no, no, it's okay.

759
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,966
We know there are agents sent
by the Chinese government

760
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:06,303
in every major university
in the United States.

761
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:09,767
Good morning.

762
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,008
Morning.

763
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,672
There's a shirt for you.

764
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,312
Thank you.

765
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,951
Pour him a cup of coffee.

766
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:36,099
How did Wen get that tape overseas to Dr.
Huang without the government getting it?

767
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,841
Even the government is not
organized enough

768
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,605
to deal with
the chaos of our mail system.

769
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,042
What's on the tape?

770
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:55,056
lt's a dictation of the major events
of Wen's book. lt's back up.

771
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,318
He sensed he was in danger.

772
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,060
What's the book about?

773
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,691
He was writing about
the Taiwanese's government's

774
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,736
systematic use of the Chinese mob.

775
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,571
The gangs sell drugs, and use
the money to buy arms

776
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,872
in other countries including
the United States.

777
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:21,206
They create fear by
spying on their own people.

778
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:26,254
Laundering money,
even killing political dissidents.

779
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:52,612
Open the door!

780
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:56,385
Open the door! Police!

781
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,590
Agent Kelly! You must come
with us immediately!

782
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,699
-Officer
-Susan!

783
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,426
Please wait a moment!

784
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,366
Keep moving!

785
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,365
Agent Kelly!
Where the hell have you been?

786
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,567
We've been looking
for you all morning.

787
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,006
Look, l don't know what's going on,

788
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,411
but l suggest you play this very cool,
let me do the talking.

789
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,073
And try not to say anything stupid.

790
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,022
Where's Kuo?

791
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,291
Good morning gentlemen.

792
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,427
Good morning. Thank you for coming.

793
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,231
l would like to take this opportunity
to reiterate the importance

794
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:55,208
the United States places
on finding Lee Shin-Shen.

795
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,938
We are aware of your concerns
Miss Kane.

796
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:02,342
And let me assure you, that we want
to find him as much as you do.

797
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,012
Thank you.

798
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,155
Do you want to find Lee or
do you want to assassinate him?

799
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,590
l saw how efficiently you
apprehended David Wu.

800
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,769
We can all appreciate l'm sure
Agent Kelly's frustration.

801
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,996
Please Ms. Kane,

802
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,733
Agent Kelly understands
what is occurring here.

803
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,207
We are eager to hear from him.

804
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,642
Well, perhaps you could tell us
what you were doing there.

805
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,875
l was doing what l was sent here to do.
l was observing.

806
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,314
Perhaps you'd like to tell me next time

807
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,376
when you're carrying out
a raid against one of my suspects.

808
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:43,050
The suspects are no longer your
suspects, it is our investigation

809
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,322
and if l tell you any information
regarding it, it will be out of courtesy.

810
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:51,900
l am quite certain, we all want
to find Lee Shin-Shen.

811
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,996
l am curious though,
how did you know where it was?

812
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:02,634
l was out for a stroll.
l saw some police activity

813
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,236
l decided to follow it.

814
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,371
Then, perhaps you could tell me

815
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:14,013
what you were doing at an illegal
protest in Kaohsiung yesterday.

816
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,784
Excuse me?

817
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:20,055
Surely, you weren't just
out for a stroll then.

818
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,794
No, l received a tip that Lee
was hiding in Kaohsiung.

819
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:26,993
And was he?

820
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,535
l don't know.

821
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,665
l was beaten over the head by
police before l could find out.

822
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,605
lndependently pursuing leads

823
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:38,136
can compromise our and
Officer Chen's investigations.

824
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,791
The last thing l want to do is
compromise this investigation.

825
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:56,631
And if l've somehow done that, l
apologize to you and Officer Chen.

826
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,351
Given the current state of unrest,

827
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:30,229
we fear it's not longer safe
for you to be here.

828
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,636
Your assistance is greatly appreciated,

829
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,369
but we will kindly request that

830
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:42,034
you leave the country no
later than tomorrow afternoon.

831
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,447
Ms. Kane.

832
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:49,812
Of course.

833
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,580
l trust that this will be enough time for
you to wrap up all your affairs here.

834
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,923
Thank you gentlemen.

835
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,458
Agent Kelly?

836
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,274
l can't leave yet!

837
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,147
My hands are absolutely tied.

838
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,380
We have no official relationship
with this country,

839
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,322
you're luck they didn't
throw you in jail!

840
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,722
Lee is the key to this whole thing.
He could blow it wide open,

841
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,795
which is why they want to get rid
of me and get to him first.

842
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,295
This is their investigation.

843
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,423
There's not going to be an investigation!
They're going to kill him.

844
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,268
What exactly are you driving at here?

845
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:54,906
l think the Taiwanese government
conspired to have Wen killed.

846
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,620
Listen, even if that was true, you'd
never be able to prove it.

847
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,421
No, not without Lee.

848
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:17,200
Stop. Show me your lD.

849
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,870
We are from the American lnstitute.

850
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,887
Go. Keep driving.

851
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,531
Listen to what you are saying.

852
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,630
You're thinking of indicting the
Taiwanese government

853
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,675
for murdering a U.S. citizen
on U.S. soil?

854
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,046
l'm really sorry it has come to this,

855
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,546
but you're going to have to let
this one go.

856
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,551
Don't leave the hotel
without calling me.

857
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,964
What's he doing?

858
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,645
Hello, operator.

859
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,149
Hello, operator. l'd like to call
the United States collect.

860
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,752
One moment please.

861
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:43,784
Hello?

862
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:44,551
Tom!

863
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,184
Jake! So, did you find out anything?

864
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,227
ls Daltry there?

865
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,764
What do you want to talk
to Daltry for? He's gone.

866
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,064
They're sending me home.

867
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,069
-What?
-lt seems l've overstayed my welcome.

868
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:57,669
This is bullshit.

869
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,367
Yeah well, shit see,
l told you to lay low.

870
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:01,940
lt's tough to lay low

871
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,376
when you're discovering the Taiwanese
government had Wen murdered.

872
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,676
What? What did you just tell to me?

873
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,647
lt makes sense the State
was calling Daltry.

874
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:13,687
Wait a minute, run that by me one more
time. What are you talking about?

875
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,719
Jake?

876
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,817
Jake?

877
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,685
Jake!

878
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,448
Hey! Don't move!

879
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,544
Shit!

880
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,270
Where are you going!

881
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,001
Hey! Stop!

882
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:46,843
Jake?

883
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,445
Huang's dead!

884
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:49,778
-What?
-lt's not safe for you. We have to go!

885
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,580
They're coming after you next.
Come on!

886
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:53,812
Come on.

887
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,440
Come.

888
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:35,091
l see you have met my sister. She
has contacts at the security police.

889
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:37,660
Apparently.

890
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,797
Victims of torture.

891
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:45,303
From Kaohsiung?

892
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,299
Some perhaps.

893
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,575
This was made by blowtorch.

894
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,179
You see for yourself the words of Dr. Huang.

895
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:56,112
lt's good fortune you were
at the protest in Kaohsiung.

896
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:00,117
l believe they have started
something that cannot be stopped.

897
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,916
Brother, come here.

898
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,019
You tell him.

899
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,299
l'm sorry, but the security
police have information

900
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,336
that Lee Shin Shen
has fled to Hong Kong.

901
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,367
Leave quickly!

902
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:33,286
FBl! That man is with me!
He is under my custody!

903
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,767
Who are they? Who?

904
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,382
Give him a taste of blow torch.

905
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:03,742
No! l don't know!

906
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,135
lf you hold still, l will
remove your handcuffs.

907
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,976
You may remove your blindfold.

908
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,823
Don't worry, you are safe.

909
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,694
You are a lucky man Agent Kelly.

910
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:08,341
After your capture l lost track
of you for many hours.

911
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:14,115
Now l was afraid one of my subordinates
executed you under his own authority.

912
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,608
That would have been unfortunate.

913
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:21,245
You certainly aren't the push over
our government was expecting.

914
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,615
Where's Ming?

915
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,359
You will see him soon.

916
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:32,795
Change can come from anywhere.
Like my friend Huang,

917
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,597
some prefer to work from the inside.

918
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,668
Huang is dead.

919
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,673
Why should l trust you?

920
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,368
You have no reason to.

921
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,676
What if l told you

922
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:49,477
your suspect Wu Da Wei
and Lee Shin Shen

923
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:54,521
were members of an organization
called the lron Blood Patriots

924
01:14:54,623 --> 01:15:00,084
and this organization was contracted
to assassinate Professor Wen.

925
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,221
You'd just be confirming something
l already suspected.

926
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,192
So the government was involved?

927
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:08,700
Yes.

928
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,033
Military command?

929
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,872
Of course.

930
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,003
But the order came from higher up.

931
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:23,379
The primary patron of the lron Blood
Patriots is the son of the President.

932
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,916
So they killed Wen to save face?

933
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:31,254
Yes.

934
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,325
But, why risk alienating the U.S.?

935
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:41,663
The decision was foolish. As are many
of the decisions l encounter these days.

936
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,704
Did you know about it?

937
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,706
Would you believe me if l said no?

938
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,638
l'd have my doubts.

939
01:15:55,651 --> 01:16:00,816
As you should. This is tricky
business here Agent Kelly.

940
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,893
We must maintain sight of
the end game at all times.

941
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:12,465
Although they won't admit it, this
government feels backed into a corner.

942
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,725
So much so, that they are right now

943
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:18,636
finalizing a deal with
several American businessmen

944
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:28,074
to fund and train Nicaraguan Contras to
fight their pro-Communist government.

945
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,877
ln exchange for that, the U.S.
Administration will back an arms

946
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:39,291
deal to Taiwan exceeding
fifty million dollars.

947
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,323
When President Nixon decided to
back Communist China,

948
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,596
the mainland gained advantage.

949
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:53,907
The U.N. seat moved
from Taipei to Beijing,

950
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:59,111
but the biggest threat to our government

951
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,977
is not the Red Giant
from across the Strait,

952
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,278
it is here in Taiwan.

953
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:12,922
What the vast majority of Taiwanese
people want is a democratic government.

954
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,997
Separate and independent from China.

955
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,896
Sounds reasonable to
you as an American.

956
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,335
China needs Taiwan.

957
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,180
Taiwan does not need China.

958
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:42,449
This is a fact the United States and the
rest of the world have never understood.

959
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:49,896
Henry Wen was Taiwanese. He was
murdered, in short, by mainlanders.

960
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,360
Now that Wu Da Wei is dead,

961
01:17:56,571 --> 01:18:00,564
Lee Shin Shen knows he is being
hunted by his employers

962
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,507
because we've made him
more dangerous

963
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:06,946
to the government than
Henry Wen ever was.

964
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,413
And now he's fled to Hong Kong.

965
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:13,954
Be careful of your intelligence
Agent Kelly.

966
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,489
We know exactly where he is.

967
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,722
You see, unlike Wu Da Wei,

968
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:24,158
Lee Shin Shen is a rather high
ranking member of the Patriots

969
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:27,463
and is therefore
afforded some protection.

970
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:32,172
We've managed to get to
a number of his Captains

971
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,367
and they've agreed to
a prize to hand him over to us.

972
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,437
We will move on him tonight.

973
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,350
And you want me to get to him
before they do?

974
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:50,853
How will l find him?

975
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:56,121
He's in a club run by the Patriots,

976
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,323
your friend Ming will know.

977
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,102
They've released him?

978
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:12,443
l have arranged a suspension
of your surveillance detail.

979
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:17,815
You do not want to miss the
last flight out, Agent Kelly.

980
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:23,117
And l wish you luck with
your last few hours in Taipei.

981
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,379
Ming!

982
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,004
Ming.

983
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,215
Are you okay?

984
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,612
Are you all right?

985
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,667
Ming.

986
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:48,493
l know where Lee is.

987
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,265
lf you help me find him,

988
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,711
l'll bring him in.

989
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,789
Who are you? Who are you?

990
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:49,259
Where is he? l know he's here.

991
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,494
Shoot the gun! Just shoot me!

992
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,386
He was my friend,

993
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,258
did you think you were going to
get away with it?

994
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,162
Honestly, l was waiting
for you to come for me.

995
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:31,564
What's he saying?

996
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,200
He says he's been waiting for us.

997
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,207
l know l have already been
sold out to the government.

998
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,513
l figure l might have better
luck in America.

999
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,017
He says, he knows his men have
made a deal with the Party.

1000
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,487
That he would rather try his luck
with the American courts.

1001
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,486
Ask him why he killed Wen.

1002
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,292
Why did you want to kill
Professor Wen?

1003
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,628
The government made me
a good deal to do it,

1004
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:07,203
but only now am l realizing that they
are not good business partners.

1005
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:10,668
He says the Party made him
a good deal at the time.

1006
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,076
Now he realizes that they
are not good partners.

1007
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,306
Who hired him?

1008
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,778
Who instructed you to do it?

1009
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:20,110
You tell him that until l am safely
out of Taiwan

1010
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:24,055
he won't get one bit
of information from me!

1011
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:30,188
He says, once he is in your custody and
off Taiwan he will tell you everything.

1012
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,125
Let's go.

1013
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:40,935
Where are you?

1014
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,009
Headed to the airport.

1015
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,941
There are two of us leaving tonight.

1016
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:45,978
lmpossible.

1017
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:49,015
Not impossible. l'm going to need
your help getting through security.

1018
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,674
l don't have that kind of power.

1019
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:51,843
You guys are great.

1020
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:55,717
l know you have enough leverage to
broker a secret arms deal to Nicaragua.

1021
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:06,399
l'll meet you at the security gate.

1022
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,527
Right here, right here!

1023
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,471
Stay safe my friend.

1024
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:47,830
l'm coming with you!

1025
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,001
No, Ming you need to get out of here.
lt's not safe for you.

1026
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,442
l do not care anymore.

1027
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:53,240
Do you know what's going to
happen if they find you here?

1028
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:56,316
The only thing left for me now is
to see you get on that plane.

1029
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,089
FBl! He's with me!

1030
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,326
Stop! Stop!

1031
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,355
Officer! Officer!

1032
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,753
Officer! Officer!

1033
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:20,561
This American is with the
American lnstitute,

1034
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:23,569
please take him away and let me
have a few minutes with him

1035
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,502
to discuss what just happened.

1036
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,268
You've been nothing
but a god damned cowboy

1037
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:33,371
since the moment you arrived.
Reckless and arrogant

1038
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:37,041
and that's going to cost the U.S. more
in political capital than you're worth.

1039
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,942
l didn't come here to see the opera.

1040
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,454
You don't need to throw out forty
years of foreign policy for one man.

1041
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:43,716
You're not going to change anything!

1042
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,621
lf you think justice for Wen is worth

1043
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:48,685
taking down the last bastion
we have against Red China,

1044
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,424
you're a traitor to this country.

1045
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:51,426
Let me tell you something.

1046
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,763
Wen was going to tell the truth
about what's going on here

1047
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,598
and he was murdered
by the government.

1048
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,866
lf that's the policy,
it deserves to be thrown out.

1049
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:06,207
Just tell them you were
bringing Lee to me.

1050
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:12,819
Please go outside for a moment.

1051
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,113
Yes, of course.

1052
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,497
God damn it!

1053
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:58,092
What happened?

1054
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,064
He wanted to wish me a good flight.

1055
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,871
So, you don't call, you don't write.

1056
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,005
l was a little busy.

1057
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:29,541
Yeah, Daltry wants to hear all about it.

1058
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:33,846
Every agent in this division
is being subpoenaed

1059
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,719
to testify before a House committee

1060
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:40,487
to explain how the
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation

1061
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:43,995
helped one of its own agents
to violate international law.

1062
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:45,963
l was sent to do a job, and l did
that job to the best of my ability.

1063
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:50,935
You were sent to observe and report
Not to get our only suspect killed

1064
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:53,439
while trying to smuggle him
illegally out of the country.

1065
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:57,032
lf we wanted Elliot Ness,
we would have sent Elliot Ness!

1066
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,476
l was the only one over there trying
to apprehend the suspect.

1067
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:02,105
lt seems to me that the only
thing you did right

1068
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,481
was turn over a known terrorist
to the Taiwanese government

1069
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,077
and you did that by accident!

1070
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:11,715
Ming was not a terrorist! l would
never have found Lee without him

1071
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,985
and now we're leaving him for dead.

1072
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:15,027
That's an internal matter for the
Taiwanese government.

1073
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:17,687
They killed his family Daltry!
His daughter wasn't a terrorist!

1074
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:18,594
lt's not our call!

1075
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,031
lt's not our call! What about the truth?

1076
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:22,863
Does that matter anymore?

1077
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:24,437
What about finding Wen's killers?

1078
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:25,300
They're not our people.

1079
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,532
They're not our people?

1080
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,039
Wen's an American citizen!

1081
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,041
His widow is an American citizen!

1082
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,975
Well, there's a lot of folks
who don't see it that way!

1083
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:33,739
Who doesn't see it that way?

1084
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:38,409
Do you have proof Wen was assassinated
by the Taiwanese government?

1085
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:42,421
Because this is still the Federal Bureau
of lnvestigation and we deal in proof

1086
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,991
and if you're going to create an
international incident,

1087
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:49,028
you damn well better have something
more than just your word to go on!

1088
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,928
And l am not about to jeopardize
the rest of my career

1089
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:56,366
for a bunch of god damned
politics that l could care less about.

1090
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:58,500
Hey!

1091
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,102
The Taiwan Bureau of lnvestigation

1092
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,738
is charging that you smuggled
out pertinent evidence.

1093
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,875
What are they talking about?

1094
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,611
Hell if l know.

1095
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:19,056
lf l may remind you Agent, it is a
felony to withhold evidence.

1096
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:26,325
You signed the same oath l did to uphold
the Constitution against all enemies,

1097
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:28,332
-foreign and domestic.
-Don't you start with me.

1098
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:33,168
l did not join the FBl to observe
people getting murdered!

1099
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:00,857
You sure you wanna do this?

1100
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,040
This isn't what l signed up for.

1101
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:14,708
You know, it's just a job.

1102
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,043
All right.

1103
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,050
Make sure to turn in any
evidence you got.

1104
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,024
ls that you or Daltry talking?

1105
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:31,193
Hey,

1106
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,227
Daltry.

1107
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,060
You know l don't care
what you do with it.

1108
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:41,740
You gotta be true to yourself, huh?
Do the right thing,

1109
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,605
only you know what that is?

1110
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,639
That's very Chinese of you Tom.

1111
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:53,710
Yeah, coming from you
l take that as a compliment.

1112
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:58,353
l'll see you around.

1113
01:34:58,793 --> 01:35:01,762
Yeah, so long. l'll miss you.

1114
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,452
We know there are agents
sent by the Chinese government

1115
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:36,155
in every major university
in the United States.

1116
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:42,096
l, too, am being watched.

1117
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,904
l've seen them photographing me
as l've left my office at night.

1118
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,336
l know what l'm doing
puts me at risk,

1119
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:52,639
to speak out and demand
change of all ways

1120
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,045
that have put others at risk in history.

1121
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:59,014
We are suffering enough now!

1122
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,288
We cannot be silent any longer.
