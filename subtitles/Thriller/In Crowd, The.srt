1
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,568
Hey.

2
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>Bathsheba Everdene</i>.

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,534
<i>Bathsheba</i>.

4
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>The name has always sounded strange to me.
I don't like to hear it said out loud</i>.

5
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:29,881
<i>My parents died when I was very young
so there's no-one to ask where it came from</i>.

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,718
<i>I've grown accustomed
to being on my own</i>.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,846
<i>Some say even too accustomed</i>.

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,392
<i>Too independent</i>.

9
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,444
Miss!

10
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,282
Miss!

11
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,715
My scarf.

12
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,301
I lost it.

13
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,179
You must be Farmer Oak.

14
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,806
Gabriel, yes.

15
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,768
My aunt's told me about you.
I'm working on her farm for the winter.

16
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,940
This is your land.

17
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,652
I'm trespassing.

18
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,570
You're welcome here.

19
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,001
Good afternoon, Farmer Oak.

20
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,170
Good afternoon, miss.

21
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,660
Come by, George.

22
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,581
George, away! Enough, George!

23
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,166
Enough!

24
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,252
Stand. Stand.

25
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,838
George, stand.

26
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,965
Away!

27
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,592
Away!

28
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,054
George, away!

29
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,807
He doesn't know when to stop,
Young George.

30
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,726
What's this one called?

31
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,102
Old George.

32
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,190
Old George.

33
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,233
So you find me amusing, do you?

34
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,202
Goodness, it's Mr. Oak.

35
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,842
...and after that she was gonna be a governess.
But she was far too wild.

36
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,719
Always has been.

37
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,355
Miss Bathsheba Everdene.

38
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,400
I've brought you a lamb.

39
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,527
Ohh.

40
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,366
Thank you, Mr. Oak. He's such a dear thing.

41
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,744
He's come too soon
and won't last the winter...

42
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,954
...so I thought you'd like to rear it instead.

43
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,540
Thank you, that's very kind.

44
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,543
I'll make some tea.

45
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,133
-The lamb is not why I came.
-Go on.

46
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,597
Well, Miss Everdene, I wanted to ask...

47
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,932
...would you like to marry me?

48
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,812
I've never asked anyone before.

49
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,066
No.

50
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,985
I should hope not.

51
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,488
Well...

52
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,075
...perhaps I... I should...

53
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,163
-Perhaps I should leave.
-Mr. Oak, there are things to consider.

54
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,333
Is someone waiting for you?

55
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,753
No, but that doesn't mean I'll marry you.

56
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,464
Good day to you, then.

57
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,974
Mr. Oak!

58
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,895
Mr. Oak! Wait!

59
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,442
I didn't say I wouldn't marry you, either.

60
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,446
I haven't ever really thought about it.

61
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,200
I have 100 acres and 200 sheep.

62
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,830
If I pay off the money, the farm is ours.

63
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,709
You could have a piano in a year or two.

64
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,045
Flowers and birds
and a frame for cucumbers.

65
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,006
A baby or two.

66
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,298
-Mr. Oak...
-Or more.

67
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,427
I will always be there for you.

68
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,222
Mr. Oak, I don't want a husband.

69
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,434
I'd hate to be some man's property.

70
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,397
I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding
if I could be one without getting a husband.

71
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,649
That's stupid talk.

72
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,570
You are better-off than I, Mr. Oak.

73
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,406
I have an education and nothing more.

74
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,659
-You could do much, much better than me.
-That's not the reason.

75
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,916
I'm too independent for you.

76
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,963
If I were to marry, I'd want somebody to
tame me and you'd never be able to do it.

77
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,925
You'd grow to despise me.

78
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,721
I would not.

79
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,308
Ever.

80
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,190
Goodbye, Miss Everdene.

81
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,419
What is it, old boy?

82
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,214
Stay here.

83
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,471
Stay here, Old George. Stay here.

84
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,482
George!

85
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,872
George!

86
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,878
No!

87
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,780
It's all yours.

88
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,210
We take no pleasure in this.

89
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,339
We wish you well, Mr. Oak.

90
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,606
Bathsheba.

91
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,945
What is it?

92
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,283
My love. It's your poor uncle's will.

93
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,786
What does it say?

94
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,622
Read it.

95
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,042
Read!

96
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:59,047
He's left you everything. It's all yours.

97
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,885
Oh, my goodness.

98
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,681
Take care, you hear.

99
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,190
Walk on.

100
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,197
Bye.

101
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,720
So who will join us, lads?

102
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,724
Which one of you fine boys
will put on the scarlet uniform...

103
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,144
...and proudly serve
his Queen and country?

104
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,646
See the world.

105
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,650
Form an orderly line, gentlemen,
at the front.

106
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,153
This gentleman in the straw hat,
step forward, sir.

107
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,779
That's my sweetheart, right there.

108
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,658
You, sir, next to the pretty lady.

109
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,244
There's a good strong figure of a man.

110
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,912
Join us, sir.

111
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,874
Go on. You'd make a fine soldier.

112
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,960
-Always room for a gentleman of your caliber.
-It's a roof over your head. Food.

113
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,798
Who wants a fine wage?

114
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,300
Excuse me.

115
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,969
You might try Weatherbury.
If you're looking for work...

116
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,138
...there's a farm there
needs all the help it can get.

117
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,975
I will. Thank you.

118
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,355
You should have a cloak for a day like this.

119
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,607
Francis will take care of me.

120
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,778
We are to be married soon.

121
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,197
Goodbye.

122
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,533
Come on, a decent wage.
Make your family proud.

123
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,661
Food, shelter. Who will join us?

124
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,050
Go and wake up the other farms!

125
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,094
Get them down here! We need more hands!

126
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,596
We need more men now! Wake them up!

127
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,933
Go and get the Smith brothers first.

128
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,644
Protect yourself, the fire's spreading!

129
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,272
Who's in charge here?

130
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,567
We're losing the ricks! The rick is lost.

131
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,944
We need to save the barn.
Come on, help me!

132
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,906
Come on, get some more water!
Get some more water!

133
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,995
-We need to push this out. Come on!
-Heave!

134
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,749
Heave!

135
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,459
Heave!

136
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,254
Come on, push!

137
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,654
Everybody out! Everybody out!

138
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,454
Water! More over here!
The barn's going up!

139
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,831
Get the sacks out, the roof's about to go!

140
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,141
What's he doing up there?

141
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,769
We lose the barn, we lose everything.

142
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:07,230
Joseph, bring those brooms over
and let's get this sorted out.

143
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,026
Look sharp, men, the farmer's here.

144
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,917
Mr. Oak, is that you?

145
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,591
Perhaps you want a shepherd, ma'am?

146
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,388
I owe you an immense debt, Mr. Oak.

147
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,183
If I'd have lost all of this,
I'd have lost my farm.

148
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,309
Your farm?

149
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:49,022
My inheritance. My home, too,
for a while when my parents died.

150
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,193
When my uncle passed away,
he left it to me.

151
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,946
Of course, it's a little ragged now...

152
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,700
...but this once used to be
the finest farm for miles.

153
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,286
And I intend to make it so again.

154
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,956
Perhaps you find the idea preposterous.

155
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,417
I no longer have that luxury.

156
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,005
I'm truly sorry to hear of your loss,
Mr. Oak...

157
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,050
...but if our reversal of fortune
causes you any embarrassment...

158
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,803
Not at all-- ma'am.

159
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,559
<i>Billy Smallbury? 9 and 8 pence</i>.

160
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,397
Joseph Poorgrass?

161
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,441
-Go on, Joseph.
-Go on, lad.

162
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,110
Hat off.

163
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,739
-And what do you do, Joseph?
-I does general things.

164
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,867
And in spring I shoot the rooks
and help at pig killing, sir.

165
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,285
I mean ma'am.

166
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,833
7 and 9 pence.
And another 9 because I'm new.

167
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,710
Thank you, ma'am.

168
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,882
Now, Fanny Robbin?

169
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,262
Where is Fanny Robbin?

170
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,097
Where is she?

171
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,392
She's run away, ma'am.

172
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,894
She's gone off with a soldier, ma'am.

173
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,105
Not a soldier, a sergeant.

174
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,194
Bailiff Pennyways?

175
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,452
Here is 10 shillings and a further 10.

176
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,412
Why?

177
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,957
This ends our association.
You are dismissed.

178
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,001
I beg pardon, miss.

179
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,254
When my uncle was alive,
this was a fine, productive farm.

180
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,049
Since his death, it has fallen into ruin.

181
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,177
Now see here, miss.

182
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,595
You can't get rid of people like that.

183
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,597
I have resolved not to have a bailiff
and to manage everything.

184
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,891
Mr. Pennyways, if you'll listen to me
for a moment.

185
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,896
Mr. Pennyways, a fire threatened to destroy
the barn and you are nowhere to be found.

186
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,820
I have no use for a man like you,
Mr. Pennyways.

187
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,907
You are dismissed.

188
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,167
Get out while you can, if I were you.

189
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,473
Now you've all met our new shepherd
Mr. Oak.

190
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,267
You understand your duties, Mr. Oak?

191
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,479
If I don't, I'll ask, ma'am.

192
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,488
From now on you have a mistress,
not a master.

193
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,283
I don't yet know my talents in farming,
but I shall do my best.

194
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,661
Don't suppose, because I'm a woman,

195
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,497
I don't know the difference between
bad goings-on and good.

196
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,791
I shall be up before you're awake.

197
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,127
I shall be a-field before you are up.

198
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,797
It is my intention to astonish you all.

199
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,218
Back to work, please.

200
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,614
Perhaps I should wait here?

201
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,907
No.

202
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,037
Nonsense, Liddy. You're my companion.

203
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,247
-All of these?
-All of them.

204
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,502
Head high, Liddy.
If they stare, do not hesitate.

205
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,429
Remember, we have as much right
to be here as anyone.

206
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,934
Good morning.

207
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,121
-Liddy, if you lay things out.
-Yes, miss.

208
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,793
Gentlemen, shall we get back to business?

209
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,931
There you go, sir. If you feel it,
you can feel the quality.

210
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,141
-This is fine grain, miss.
-Thank you.

211
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,063
Perhaps we should leave, miss.

212
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,444
-But none of it as good as this lot.
-It's good stuff, I'll grant you that.

213
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,030
-Well, it's up to you. If you wanna go elsewhere...
-No, no, no...

214
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,281
Farmer Stone?

215
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,411
It's Miss Everdene.
Farmer Everdene's niece.

216
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,164
He talked about you
with such great admiration.

217
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,794
Of course, you're welcome to try elsewhere

218
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,006
but I think you'll find the grain as good
as it's ever been.

219
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,053
-Mr. Stone?
-How much?

220
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,141
-£5 a quarter.
-£3 10 shillings.

221
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,811
It's the same grain, Mr. Stone.
You paid my uncle £5.

222
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,688
£3.10.

223
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,026
This gentleman will pay me
the proper price.

224
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,447
Apparently not, no.

225
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,033
-£4.
-£4.10.

226
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,701
£4.05.

227
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,370
Perhaps I should move on.

228
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,875
-Liddy, would you help me with this gentleman?
-Of course.

229
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,544
Perhaps you'd like a sample?

230
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,005
-How much?
-£5 a quarter.

231
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,215
Very well.

232
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,178
£4.10.

233
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:30,382
He's rich, he's handsome.
He sends the local girls mad.

234
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,135
The Taylor sisters
worked on him for 2 years.

235
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,638
Jane Perkins spent £20 on new clothes...

236
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,891
...and might as well have
thrown the money out the window.

237
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,939
It's said, when he was young,
his sweetheart jilted him.

238
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,693
People always say that.

239
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:53,321
Women don't jilt men. Men jilt us.

240
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:56,199
Did someone jilt you, miss?

241
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,451
Certainly not.

242
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:05,417
A man did ask to marry me once.
Some time ago.

243
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,336
But I was too restless to be tied down.

244
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,715
What a luxury-- to have a choice.

245
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,012
"Kiss my foot, sir, my face
is for mouths of consequence."

246
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,972
It wasn't like that at all.

247
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,224
Why?

248
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,810
Did you love him?

249
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,730
No, but I rather liked him.

250
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,025
Anyway, it's impossible now.

251
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,040
Mr. Boldwood.

252
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,459
Don't shoot me, please.

253
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,753
I had no intention of shooting you.

254
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,632
It's Miss Everdene. Your neighbor.

255
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,136
Farmer Everdene's niece.

256
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm managing the farm alone now.
Perhaps you've heard?

257
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,977
Yes, I'm sure you'll do very well.

258
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,689
In the circumstances.

259
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:16,529
Well-- as you say, we're neighbors.

260
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,710
Look what I've got here.

261
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,172
-What is it?
-Listen to this.

262
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,049
The rose is red
The violet blue

263
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:39,094
Carnation's sweet and so are you

264
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,016
It's a Valentine's card. I'm going to send it
to Joseph Poorgrass...

265
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,852
...just to see the look of panic
on his stupid face.

266
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,730
Poor boy. It's a little bit far-fetched, isn't it?

267
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,025
What about-- Mr. Oak, then?

268
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,736
No. Not Mr. Oak.

269
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,824
Imagine if we sent it to Mr. Boldwood.

270
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,411
Ignoring you like that, all high and mighty.

271
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,579
Mr. Boldwood?

272
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,916
Perhaps not.

273
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,793
Why not?

274
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,337
Because I don't think he'll see the humor.

275
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,382
Perhaps he wouldn't,
perhaps it's too much.

276
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:21,886
-Mr. Boldwood.
-You're right. Perhaps it is.

277
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,848
So we're gonna toss for it.

278
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:25,932
Liddy!

279
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,308
Come on.

280
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,565
-Open Joseph.
-No, Jan Coggan.

281
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:37,485
Open Jan Coggan.  Closed Boldwood.

282
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,767
-Sergeant Troy, 11:00.
-Yes, Sergeant Troy. And?

283
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,313
-Miss Fanny Robbin.
-Welcome. Step down the front.

284
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:31,266
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

285
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,936
Here she comes.

286
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,787
Sorry I'm late, old boy.

287
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,331
Not long now.

288
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,106
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight...

289
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:28,448
-I can only wait a few more minutes.
-She'll be here.

290
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,018
What do you think is happening?

291
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,313
I don't think she's coming, old boy.

292
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,971
Come on.  Go on, off you go.
That's it...go on.

293
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,307
-Morning, my love.
-Come on.

294
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:41,062
Bring them in, John.

295
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,614
Miss Everdene's here, you better do your
best work. I'm looking at you, Coggan.

296
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,867
Yeah, you keep quiet, Liddy.

297
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,209
What you doing?

298
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,922
Perhaps you'd care to lend a hand?

299
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,843
-You don't think I would?
-No, you wouldn't.

300
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,679
Come here.

301
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,560
There, she's getting in.

302
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,522
Well done, ma'am.

303
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,923
Gangway through.
Hey, Joseph. Joseph, look.

304
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,921
Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.

305
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:38,179
Miss Everdene. Mr. Boldwood wondered
if he might have a word with you.

306
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,853
Mr. Boldwood. Of course.

307
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:50,525
1,000 acres. A mix of arable and livestock.

308
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,652
Adjacent to Everdene.

309
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:56,448
An orchard. Glasshouse.

310
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,492
I have some interesting pigs.

311
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,372
Some other time, perhaps.

312
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:10,837
Thank you.

313
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:24,517
You have a very beautiful house.

314
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,358
Mr. Boldwood?

315
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,695
Miss Everdene.

316
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,032
I want...

317
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,203
...very much --more than anything...

318
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,164
...to have you as my wife.

319
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:49,876
Miss Everdene, marry me.

320
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,090
I...

321
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,885
...I feel...

322
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:04,557
...though I respect you very much...

323
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:10,230
...I do not feel what would justify me...

324
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,194
...in accepting your offer.

325
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,743
I have known disappointments before...

326
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:29,040
...but I would never have asked
in this instance had I not been, er...

327
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,918
...led to believe...

328
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,881
...unless, unless I am mistaken.

329
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,135
The Valentine.

330
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,764
No, you're not mistaken
but I should never have sent it.

331
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,060
Forgive me, it was thoughtless
to disturb your peace of mind.

332
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,603
So you meant it as a joke?

333
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,815
No. No, not as a joke.

334
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,362
Not exactly. It was-- impetuous.

335
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,488
I see.

336
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,950
Perhaps you think I am too old?

337
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,911
But I will care for you
more than anyone your own age.

338
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,289
-I'm sure you would...
-I will protect you.

339
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,751
You shall have dresses...

340
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:17,005
...a gig. A piano.

341
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,760
I amuse you.

342
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,846
No.

343
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,515
It's only...

344
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,685
...I have a piano.

345
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,647
And I have my own farm.

346
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:41,488
And I have no need for a husband--
no matter how honored I am by the offer.

347
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:49,454
I think I'd like to return home.

348
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,374
Yes, er... I'll, er...

349
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,460
...I'll get someone to drive you.

350
00:38:56,002 --> 00:39:00,340
Mr. Boldwood, I've made you miserable.
It was very wicked of me.

351
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,966
Will you reconsider?

352
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:06,971
Let me think.

353
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:10,684
Yes.

354
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,853
Yes, I'll give you time.

355
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,690
I will wait.

356
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,717
You're working late, Mr. Oak.

357
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,849
Will you teach me?

358
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,351
Here.

359
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,354
Spin the wheel.

360
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,107
Incline it, like that.

361
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,694
And slide it gently. Spin the wheel.

362
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,867
Bit faster. Like that. Very good.

363
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:13,079
-Now slide it.
-I, it's...

364
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,458
...getting stuck.

365
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,133
I wanted to ask...

366
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,053
...did the men say anything today
about Mr. Boldwood?

367
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,388
-They did.
-What did they say?

368
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,641
That you'd be married
before the end of the year.

369
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,477
Come on.

370
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:39,773
Well, I'd like you to contradict it,
to the men.

371
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,777
-Well, Bathsheba...
-"Miss Everdene," please.

372
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,948
If Mr. Boldwood
did really speak of marriage...

373
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,327
...I'm not going to tell stories
just to please you.

374
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:57,374
I just wanted you to mention that it might
not be true I was going to marry him.

375
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:01,711
I could say that. But I could also give you
an opinion on what you've done.

376
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,631
I dare say,
but I don't want your opinion, Mr. Oak.

377
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,302
I suppose not.

378
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,649
Well, what is your opinion?

379
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,654
That you're greatly to blame for playing
pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood.

380
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,324
Your actions were unworthy of you.

381
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:36,996
Unworthy? May I ask
where my unworthiness lies?

382
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,499
In rejecting you, perhaps?

383
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:44,170
I've long given up thinking of that.
Or wishing it, either.

384
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,844
But I will say this: leading on a man
you don't care for is beneath you.

385
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,975
I cannot allow a man to criticize
my private conduct.

386
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:00,228
You will please leave the farm
at the end of the week.

387
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,362
I'd prefer to go at once.

388
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:12,198
Then go.
I never want to see your face again.

389
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,369
Very well, Miss Everdene.

390
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,909
Whoa, there we are. There.

391
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,081
What's wrong with them?

392
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,751
They broke fence and ate the young clover.
Makes their stomachs swell.

393
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:10,215
-Well, what do we do now?
-Nothing. The whole flock is blasted.

394
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:11,925
You mean they're all going to die?

395
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:14,177
-Most probably.
-Another one gone here, ma'am.

396
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:19,099
Only one way of saving them.
You must pierce their side with a tool.

397
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:22,394
A hollow tube. Pricker inside.

398
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,396
Well, can you do it?

399
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:27,065
-This one's still alive.
-No.

400
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,109
-Can I?
-Oh good Lord, no.

401
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:33,405
One inch to the right or the left,
and you kill the ewe for sure.

402
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:37,325
Not even a shepherd can do it --as a rule.

403
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,619
Well who, then?

404
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,970
Gabriel.

405
00:43:58,471 --> 00:43:59,931
Gabriel!

406
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,100
Gabriel Oak, wait!

407
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:06,312
Miss Everdene needs you.

408
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:14,154
Why are you alone? Did you find him?

409
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:15,989
Yes, miss.

410
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,199
So what did he say?

411
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:21,494
He said...

412
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,372
Joseph?

413
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:29,669
He said you're to go in person
and request him civilly in a proper manner.

414
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,547
Where does he get his airs?
I'll do no such thing.

415
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:39,137
He said you'd say that. He said to reply:
"Beggars can't be choosers."

416
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,659
Mr. Oak.

417
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,538
Gabriel.

418
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,042
Gabriel.

419
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,254
Please don't desert me, Gabriel.

420
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,758
I need your help.

421
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,863
Make room for me.

422
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:10,186
-I wanna see.
-No, don't you start, Liddy, be quiet.

423
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:12,105
Find the spot.

424
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:16,067
Between the ribs.

425
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:20,280
-Oh Lord!
-No, no, no, no, no.

426
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,990
Now...

427
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,492
I can see his heart beating.

428
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:30,123
-Come on.
-Come on, girl.

429
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:32,751
Come on.

430
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:37,130
She'll be all right. She'll be all right.
You alright? Alright, Pixie!

431
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:15,126
<i>Lay me lo</i>w

432
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,046
<i>Lay me lo</i>w

00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:23,134

<i>Where no-one can hurt m</i>e

436
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:45,699
Please, quiet.

437
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:54,374

Miss. Mr. Boldwood is here.

444
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:19,357
Thank you. Thank you, Jan. Jan, thank you.

445
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:27,032
Mr. Boldwood. What a pleasant surprise.
Will you join us?

446
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,674
Nice to have you, sir.

447
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,055
A song, ma'am.

448
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:52,057
I have no voice.

449
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,769
Come on, ma'am, you've got a lovely voice.

450
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:12,952

00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:19,209

<i>How my love slighted m</i>e

470
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:16,201
-I thought we were rather good together.
-So did I.

471
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:19,204
We would make a fine duo.

472
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:23,083
I wanted to thank you for not approaching me
on that subject again.

473
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:27,420
Well, it has not been easy.

474
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,766
Do you wish me to...accompany you
back to the house?

475
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:44,688
No, I like to walk around the farm
every night to make sure all is safe.

476
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:49,150
Then I, I can walk...with you.

477
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,528
I've done it many times alone.

478
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:56,950
Goodnight, Mr. Boldwood. You've been
very kind. A pleasure to see you.

479
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,739
-Who are you?
-I'm sorry. I seem to be lost.

480
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:38,950
We're entangled. Are you hurt?

481
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:41,619
-No.
-I'm looking for Weatherbury.

482
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,123
-I hope I didn't startle you.
-We've got...hitched together somehow.

483
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:49,169
-Here, allow me.
-No. No. Please, let me do it myself.

484
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:53,423
If you lift your foot for a moment.

485
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,147
Please don't stare.

486
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:11,983
I don't think I've ever seen a face
as beautiful as yours.

487
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:20,200
You shouldn't be here.
Please let me have the lamp.

488
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:33,797
A mighty impressive harvest
this looks like.

489
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:46,559
Miss...

490
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,978
...look.

491
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:54,526
Who is he, Liddy?

492
00:53:54,567 --> 00:54:00,031
Sergeant Francis Troy. Noble blood,
full of promise. Very sharp and trim.

493
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,077
Well-educated. There was good things
expected of him.

494
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:07,247
He threw it all in to be a soldier.

495
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:12,043
-Well, I won't have it.
-What are you doing, miss?

496
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,337
I'm going to tell him to leave.

497
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:23,513
Sergeant Troy, I must absolutely insist that
you leave at this very moment.

498
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,056
I can't.

499
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,017
Will you follow me, please?

500
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,205
What angers you, exactly?

501
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,374
Please.

502
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:55,045
What I said or the way I said it?
You must know.

503
00:54:55,545 --> 00:54:57,964
There must be some man
who tells you that you're beautiful.

504
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:02,218
-Oh, not to my face, no...
-But there is someone who kisses you?

505
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,429
I've never been kissed.

506
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,229
Why couldn't you have just passed by
and said nothing?

507
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,983
Do you forgive me?

508
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,111
-I do not.
-Why?

509
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:22,781
Because the things you say...

510
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:24,616
I said that you were beautiful.

511
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,956
I wonder if you fight as well as you speak.

512
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:33,333
Better.

513
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:42,467
Meet me-- tomorrow.

514
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:45,720
I can't.

515
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:47,472
You don't want to?

516
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,431
Yes, but...

517
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:49,849
-Then you must.
-I mustn't.

518
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:51,976
Nobody would know.

519
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,314
Please go now.

520
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,525
Tomorrow.

521
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:00,527
8:00.

522
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,780
The hollow in the ferns.

523
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,026
Do you trust me?

524
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,779
I do.

525
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:17,497
I give you my word as a soldier,
I will not harm you.

526
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,541
The sword is blunt...

527
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,877
...but you must not flinch.

528
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:25,505
I'll try not to.

529
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,136
You cut my hair.

530
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:17,807
This sword could skin you alive.

531
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:23,355
-But you told me I was safe.
-And you were. Entirely safe.

532
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,066
I gave you my word.

533
00:59:27,817 --> 00:59:29,944
Now I will take this.

534
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:49,399
Miss Everdene.

535
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:52,694
Perhaps I could walk with you?

536
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,238
I'm quite happy to walk by myself.

537
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,576
You should have nothing to do with him.

538
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,911
He's not good enough for you.

539
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,539
He's a perfectly decent man.

540
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:09,502
-That's not what I believe.
-Why? What have you heard?

541
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:14,507
You don't know him at all. It's all rumors.

542
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:19,095
-Prejudice simply because he's a soldier.
-I like soldiers. But not this one.

543
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,556
I believe him to have no conscience at all.

544
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:26,686
Stay clear. Don't listen to him.
Don't believe him.

545
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:28,521
Get rid of him.

546
01:01:28,563 --> 01:01:30,565
And what is it to you?

547
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:38,406
I'm not such a fool as to imagine I might stand
a chance now that you are so above me.

548
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:42,285
But don't suppose I'm content to stay
a nobody all my life.

549
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:45,497
One day I will leave you.
You can be sure of that.

550
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:50,502
But for now, I care for you too much
to see you go to ruin because of him.

551
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:55,298
So if you don't mind, I'll...

552
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,427
...I'll stay by your side.

553
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:03,556
Good evening.

554
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,243
<i>Mr. Boldwood..</i>.

555
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,621
<i>...you have been a dear friend to me
these past months</i>.

556
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:31,459
<i>And it is because I value our friendship
so greatly that I am writing</i>.

557
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:37,507
<i>I am honored by your proposal
and have given it much thought..</i>.

558
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:40,051
<i>...but I must tell you that,
to my own surprise..</i>.

559
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:44,347
<i>...I have undergone what can only be
described as a change of heart..</i>.

560
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,600
<i>...and I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer</i>.

561
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,209
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

562
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:15,712
Where else would I be?

563
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,799
You ready?

564
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:24,179
Are you sure?

565
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,643
How does this sound?

566
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,981
Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

567
01:03:50,246 --> 01:03:51,581
All right?

568
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,597
Walk on.

569
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:40,333
Gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.

570
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:46,423
A short time ago I had the privilege...

571
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:52,303
...and the simple fortune
of meeting this angel.

572
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:54,639
Your mistress.

573
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:58,643
And now I stand before you her husband...

574
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,021
...your master...

575
01:07:02,188 --> 01:07:04,941
...and the proudest man you will ever see.

576
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,487
So, please--charge your glasses...

577
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:14,451
...and sing out to my most beautiful wife...

578
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:18,788
...Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

579
01:07:24,544 --> 01:07:27,839
Miss Everdene...
there's going to be a storm.

580
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:31,843
Oak, you big lump. To me.

581
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:36,973
There's going to be a storm. We need to
protect the ricks or we'll lose the harvest.

582
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,018
I need 5 to 6 men for an hour, no more.

583
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,521
-Frank, perhaps we ought to...
-No. Darling, it's our wedding celebration.

584
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:48,902
It will not rain tonight. My wife forbids it.

585
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:51,613
Now if you'll excuse me.

586
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:54,449
Friends!

587
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:57,285
One more thing.

588
01:07:57,702 --> 01:08:02,374
I may no longer be Sergeant Troy...

589
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:06,544
...but I remain a soldier in this one respect!

590
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:11,383
The finest bottles of French brandy...

591
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,553
...a triple strength dose for every man.

592
01:08:15,595 --> 01:08:18,098
Cheers! To your health!

593
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:02,308
<i>"Pretty Polly Pretty Polly
It's I've come a-woo-in'</i>"

594
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:08,023
<i>"Pretty Polly Pretty Polly
It's I've come a-woo-in'</i>"

595
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,193
<i>She says, "Creep and crawl through
the window then and..</i>.

596
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:18,616
<i>"...then let's get doin'
And lay your leg over me, over me, do</i>"

597
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:24,581
<i>"Oh, me britches is tight
and I cannot undo 'e</i>m

598
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:29,878
<i>"Oh, me britches is tight
and I cannot undo 'em</i>"

599
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:33,715
<i>"There's a knife on the window sill, love,
take it to 'e</i>m

600
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:36,968
<i>"And lay your leg over me...</i>"

601
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,034
<i>About 40 weeks after,
the fine baby come bawlin</i>'

602
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:06,706
<i>Never regretted that creepin' and crawlin</i>'

603
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:09,876
<i>"Lay your leg over me, over me...</i>"

604
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:59,134
Gabriel!

605
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:02,887
Gabriel!

606
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:06,349
What can I do?

607
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,351
It's too dangerous!

608
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:09,894
I'm coming up!

609
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:18,611
Come on.

610
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,281
Hold it down.

611
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:24,367
Still no rain.

612
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:26,494
It'll come.

613
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,471
Come on, hold me! Come here. Come here.

614
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:14,959
Gabriel, I've been a fool.

615
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:19,214
I've always had contempt for silly girls...

616
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:22,550
...dazzled by flattery
in a scarlet uniform and...

617
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:25,845
...and now I've done
what I swore I would never do.

618
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:30,433
But he told me about another woman...

619
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:35,563
...a woman more beautiful that
he'd loved before and I couldn't bear it.

620
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:40,610
So somewhere between jealousy
and distraction, I married him.

621
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,947
I don't want an opinion
on the subject, I just...

622
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:46,408
In fact, I forbid it.

623
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,164
Go to bed.

624
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,793
I'll finish it on my own.

625
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,462
Gabriel...

626
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:04,676
...thank you.

627
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:31,244
Sir?

628
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,541
Mr. Boldwood, sir!

629
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,420
I wanted to ensure
your mistress' crops were safe.

630
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:43,548
Good work, Gabriel.
She's lucky to have you.

631
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:46,468
Wait a moment, sir.

632
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:55,935
You seem unwell, sir.

633
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:58,313
You should go home.

634
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:01,232
Yes--

635
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,154
Yes. I will.

636
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:12,786
Oak.

637
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:17,999
You know that things
have not gone well with me, lately.

638
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:23,588
I was going to get a little settled in life.
But, er...

639
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:29,636
...it was not to be.

640
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,891
I daresay I'm something of a...

641
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:37,894
...a joke about the parish.

642
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:42,273
But I do wanna make one thing clear.

643
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,819
There was no jilting on her part.

644
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:51,533
We were never engaged.
No matter what people say.

645
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:55,036
She promised me nothing.

646
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,544
And yet...

647
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:04,629
...Gabriel...

648
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:11,428
...I feel the most terrible grief.

649
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,186
Not a word to her.

650
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:23,898
We understand each other, yes?

651
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,153
Yes, sir.

652
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,168
Sit.

653
01:16:25,418 --> 01:16:27,712
Stay. Now turn around.

654
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:36,554
-Can you spare a coin, please?
-No, no.

655
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,935
Hit him!

656
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:43,520
Come on!

657
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:49,484
Hit him!

658
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:56,825
Pay up, Mr. Troy.

659
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:59,077
Just take it.

660
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,585
Sir, excuse me.
Could you spare a coin, please?

661
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:09,504
No.

662
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:13,341
Fanny?

663
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:22,475
Hello, Frank.

664
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:26,104
Hello.

665
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:29,858
You're so pale.

666
01:17:30,483 --> 01:17:33,987
-Oh, Frank.
-Darling, your hands are shaking.

667
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:39,576
I thought you said All Souls, not All Saints.
I went to the wrong church.

668
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:44,289
When I got there you'd gone.
And I don't blame you...

669
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:47,292
...but it's been very hard, Frank. I...

670
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,626
Not now.

671
01:17:49,753 --> 01:17:52,088
My wife mustn't see you.

672
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:54,132
Your wife?

673
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:07,187
Mrs. Troy is very beautiful.

674
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:10,607
No more than you.

675
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:17,906
Frank, I must tell you,
I'm carrying your child.

676
01:18:17,947 --> 01:18:19,324
What?

677
01:18:31,586 --> 01:18:34,672
What if I told you that
I'd made a terrible mistake?

678
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:38,468
But that I will make amends.

679
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:43,807
I swear on my life I will find a home for you
and our baby.

680
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:48,186
-You've sworn before, Frank.
-No, this time... This time...

681
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:58,488
Go to Budmouth. Stay at the Union.

682
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:02,075
-The workhouse, Frank?
-Tonight, just tonight. One night.

683
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:05,245
And then meet me tomorrow at 10:00
on the bridge.

684
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,207
I'll bring you all the money I have
and I'll find a home for you.

685
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:14,921
You'll be safe, my darling.
And I promise you, I promise you...

686
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:17,006
...I will make amends.

687
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:24,014
Get back in the carriage.

688
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:26,224
Do you know who that woman is?

689
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:27,726
I do.

690
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:30,437
-Who is she?
-She's nothing.

691
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,690
Get back in the carriage.

692
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:35,984
Frank...

693
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,847
Could you let me have £20?

694
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:51,935
What for?

695
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,187
I need it.

696
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,401
If you continue to gamble,
we will lose the farm.

697
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:01,861
-It's not for gambling.
-What's it for?

698
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:04,406
Why should it matter what it's for?
It's my money.

699
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:07,033
I work for it, don't I?

700
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,661
No. You don't.

701
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,580
Not proper farm work.

702
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:16,876
Don't do something you'll regret.

703
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:23,133
The money is required for farm expenses.

704
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,348
No mistake, Mr. Oak.

705
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:14,100
This was Miss Robbin's last known abode.

706
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:17,145
Fanny was my uncle's servant
and we shall treat her with respect.

707
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:21,858
Perhaps we should take her to the church,
just for tonight.

708
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,235
No, bring her inside, please.

709
01:22:44,714 --> 01:22:46,508
What did she die of, Liddy?

710
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:49,928
I don't know, miss.

711
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:53,807
There were rumors but...

712
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:57,352
Fanny had a sweetheart, didn't she?

713
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,354
Yes, miss.

714
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,607
A soldier.

715
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:09,447
Please, come and sit upstairs with me.

716
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:29,718
I seem to cry a great deal these days.

717
01:23:32,303 --> 01:23:34,806
I never used to cry at all.

718
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:46,234
Goodnight, Liddy.

719
01:23:46,484 --> 01:23:48,361
'Night, miss.

720
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:45,752
What?

721
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:47,504
Who is it?

722
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:50,590
-I can't stay...
-Stay, stay. Stay.

723
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:12,654
Don't kiss them, Frank.

724
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:15,365
I'm still your wife.

725
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:25,959
This woman, dead as she is...

726
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:31,923
...is more to me than you ever were, or are,
or can be.

727
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:36,428
You are nothing to me now.

728
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:40,640
Nothing.

729
01:27:48,309 --> 01:27:50,311
Mrs. Troy?

730
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:58,361
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid your husband has drowned.

731
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,541
-That's a great responsibility, sir.
-Nonsense.

732
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:38,670
No reason why a man of your ability
shouldn't be able to superintend 2 farms.

733
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:41,715
And why shouldn't there be stronger links
between our establishments?

734
01:29:41,756 --> 01:29:45,552
Think of it. 2,000 acres
under your sole charge.

735
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:47,554
A share of my profits.

736
01:29:47,595 --> 01:29:50,223
-Miss Everdene needs me here.
-And her farm will have priority.

737
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:52,851
-I'd still need Miss Everdene's permission.
-But, of course.

738
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:55,979
Of course, I wouldn't dare do anything
without her blessing. And...

739
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:58,565
...if it'll help sway your decision...

740
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:05,280
...there's an old comrade of yours here.

741
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:08,366
Georgie.

742
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,910
Had to go all the way to Norcombe Hill
to find this old fella.

743
01:30:10,952 --> 01:30:12,078
You pleased?

744
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:14,205
Yes, sir, very much.

745
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:17,083
And I'll have your decision soon, yes?

746
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,210
You will, sir.

747
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:21,087
Hey, Georgie.

748
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,258
Come on. Come on.

749
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,274
Gabriel, you're getting on in the world.

750
01:30:41,858 --> 01:30:46,029
-Of course you must accept the offer.
-Only with your approval.

751
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:50,450
If I lose the farm, there may be no future
for any of us here.

752
01:30:50,909 --> 01:30:53,119
You know where my loyalty lies.

753
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,707
You're a man of great talent.

754
01:30:58,041 --> 01:31:01,628
It's only natural that you should rise.
I've no desire to hold you back.

755
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:13,890
Thank you.

756
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:20,939
Come on, Georgie.

757
01:31:25,443 --> 01:31:30,740
Forgive me-- I understand there are debts.

758
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:33,660
Your late husband.

759
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:37,706
Perhaps,
perhaps we should change the subject.

760
01:31:37,747 --> 01:31:39,416
Perhaps I can help.

761
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:46,631
Mr. Boldwood, that's a very kind offer...

762
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:49,175
...but I would never dream
of accepting any money.

763
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:55,849
I am a middle-aged man...

764
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:00,687
...willing to protect you
for the rest of your life.

765
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:06,860
You may run your farm, if you wish.
Without risk.

766
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:10,697
I'll pay your...

767
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:16,161
...departed husband's debts
and guarantee its financial stability.

768
01:32:17,495 --> 01:32:19,706
It can be your pastime.

769
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:24,627
Of course, we'd...need to wait...

770
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:27,172
...for propriety's sake.

771
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:29,632
But when you're ready...

772
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:32,552
...I'm offering you shelter.

773
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:37,557
Comfort. A safe harbor.

774
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:42,395
As my wife.

775
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:49,235
You must at least admire my persistence.

776
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:53,782
I do.

777
01:32:53,823 --> 01:32:55,867
-And like me?
-Yes.

778
01:32:57,077 --> 01:32:59,621
And...respect me?

779
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:01,706
Yes. Very much.

780
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:04,042
Which is it? Like or respect?

781
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:10,632
It is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings...

782
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:13,385
...in a language chiefly
made by men to express theirs.

783
01:33:13,426 --> 01:33:17,931
If you worry about a lack of passion
on your part, a lack of...

784
01:33:20,558 --> 01:33:22,060
...desire...

785
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:28,608
...if you worry about marrying me
merely out of guilt...

786
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,527
...and, er...

787
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:35,699
...pity...and compromise, well...

788
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,576
...I don't mind.

789
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:44,582
When must you give your answer?

790
01:33:44,624 --> 01:33:46,251
By Christmas.

791
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:51,131
It's a terrible responsibility.

792
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:54,968
I hold that man's future in my hands.

793
01:33:55,635 --> 01:33:57,929
His sanity, too, perhaps.

794
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:01,433
-Could you care for him?
-You may suppose love is wanting.

795
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:06,604
But love's a worn-out, miserable thing
for me now.

796
01:34:06,646 --> 01:34:08,606
Why are you asking me?

797
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:17,323
I need someone who's objective.
Indifferent.

798
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:21,619
Then I'm afraid
you're asking the wrong man.

799
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:41,598
Good evening, Mr. Oak.

800
01:34:43,266 --> 01:34:44,684
Good evening.

801
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,372
-That's it.
-Mind.

802
01:35:41,032 --> 01:35:43,410
I appreciate you coming along, Oak.

803
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:49,332
Yes, very good. Well done.
Just more, more things.

804
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:56,589
So what do you think?

805
01:35:57,257 --> 01:35:59,926
I'm not in the habit of organizing parties.

806
01:36:00,176 --> 01:36:04,014
Perhaps we should make it an annual event.
Every Christmas Eve.

807
01:36:04,055 --> 01:36:07,142
I've invited the whole village.
Do you think they'll come?

808
01:36:07,183 --> 01:36:10,770
-Do you think Miss Everdene will come?
-I'm sure she will.

809
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,859
And you'll come too, I hope.

810
01:36:17,068 --> 01:36:19,571
I know Miss Everdene would like you
to be here.

811
01:36:19,612 --> 01:36:22,282
Perhaps, for an hour or so.

812
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:29,581
Look, I'm shaking. I'm so nervous.

813
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:32,709
Gabriel, will you...

814
01:36:33,084 --> 01:36:36,004
-As well as you can, please.
-I'll try.

815
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:39,883
Is there a knot
that's particularly fashionable?

816
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:43,094
You're asking the wrong man.

817
01:36:44,637 --> 01:36:46,097
What about women?

818
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:49,267
Does a woman keep her promise?

819
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:52,062
She has promised?

820
01:36:52,812 --> 01:36:54,814
An implied promise.

821
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:59,611
-Once again, I'm...
-Will she do what's right?

822
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,282
If it's not inconvenient to her.

823
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,577
Oak, you've become quite cynical lately.

824
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:13,750
She never promised that first time.
Therefore, she has never broken her promise.

825
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,586
She hasn't promised this time, either.

826
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:20,840
But she will. Tonight.

827
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,842
I know she will.

828
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:26,346
And when she does...

829
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:35,939
I wanted to tell you in advance, Gabriel...

830
01:37:37,482 --> 01:37:40,485
...because I... I believe I know your secret.

831
01:37:43,655 --> 01:37:46,199
I've seen you, together.

832
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:49,786
The way you speak to her.

833
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:52,497
And watch her.

834
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,209
And look after her.

835
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:58,837
And I know her...

836
01:38:00,296 --> 01:38:03,800
...profound affection for you.

837
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:06,636
You've behaved like a man...

838
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:12,183
...and as the successful rival--
successful through your kindness...

839
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:14,310
...I wish to tell you...

840
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:17,897
...I am profoundly grateful.

841
01:38:22,402 --> 01:38:24,904
The cook would like a word, sir.

842
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:37,268
-Kiss me. Joseph.
-No, please don't. Liddy, don't.

843
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,502
Would you excuse me?

844
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:10,260
I've come to say goodnight.

845
01:40:10,301 --> 01:40:14,639
Go back and talk to the poor things.
You've broken their hearts.

846
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:17,517
I don't suit this kind of affair.

847
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:20,854
No. Nor do I.

848
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,982
I wish I could go, too.

849
01:40:33,616 --> 01:40:37,829
-I must go.
-Not before you've danced. Both of you.

850
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:39,330
I insist.

851
01:40:42,876 --> 01:40:44,544
Mr. Oak?

852
01:40:47,005 --> 01:40:48,506
Thank you.

853
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:19,037
Tell me what to do.

854
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:25,377
Gabriel.

855
01:41:32,592 --> 01:41:34,552
Do what is right.

856
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:40,183
Sorry, excuse me.

857
01:42:25,562 --> 01:42:26,980
Frank.

858
01:42:28,481 --> 01:42:30,608
Black suits you.

859
01:42:32,318 --> 01:42:34,487
Although a little premature.

860
01:42:39,784 --> 01:42:41,619
You're alive.

861
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:45,832
And here I am. Pulled from the sea.

862
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:49,502
Some fishermen found me
and brought me to shore.

863
01:42:50,337 --> 01:42:52,672
Then I discovered I was dead
and found I preferred it.

864
01:42:54,924 --> 01:42:56,509
For a while, anyway.

865
01:42:56,843 --> 01:43:00,180
-Why have you come back?
-The strangest thing.

866
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:03,141
I missed you.

867
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:07,270
You don't seem very happy to see me.

868
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,981
You said I was nothing to you.

869
01:43:10,273 --> 01:43:11,649
Did I?

870
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,864
Well, then-- honesty at all times.

871
01:43:18,615 --> 01:43:21,534
I find myself in need of money.

872
01:43:22,494 --> 01:43:25,830
I gave up my profession for you,
and it seems a little harsh...

873
01:43:25,872 --> 01:43:29,334
...that you have a farm and a house
while I'm living off nothing.

874
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:32,379
-There is no money.
-Then sell the farm.

875
01:43:44,224 --> 01:43:45,558
Come home.

876
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:51,815
No.

877
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:57,237
I said, come home.

878
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:01,866
I'm your husband and you'll obey me!

879
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:20,176
Oh, my God.

880
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:51,017
Let me see.

881
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:56,856
If it's any consolation,
his life will be spared.

882
01:45:58,566 --> 01:46:00,318
Crime of passion.

883
01:46:27,262 --> 01:46:28,847
Morning, Liddy.

884
01:46:31,224 --> 01:46:34,519
It's a fine harvest, ma'am.
Best we've had in years.

885
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:36,187
Will we have it all over before the dew?

886
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:39,566
We will indeed, ma'am.
Luck's been on our side.

887
01:46:45,405 --> 01:46:48,616
Come, Liddy, give me a hand.

888
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:16,269
I'm sorry I startled you.

889
01:47:17,937 --> 01:47:21,649
I wanted to tidy up for them.
I haven't been here for so long.

890
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:26,446
Are you going in?

891
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:30,283
Rehearsals. I sing bass in the choir.

892
01:47:30,325 --> 01:47:32,160
Yes, I've heard you.

893
01:47:33,495 --> 01:47:35,288
Then I apologize.

894
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,836
I've been hoping to get a chance
to talk to you.

895
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:46,424
We, we've not spoken as much
as I'd have liked.

896
01:47:47,592 --> 01:47:48,927
No.

897
01:47:57,644 --> 01:47:59,813
I'm leaving England.

898
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:05,318
Leaving?

899
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,530
Going to America.

900
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:13,618
There's a boat leaving Bristol
in 4 days' time. I'll be on it.

901
01:48:14,035 --> 01:48:16,705
Now that the farm is secure.

902
01:48:16,955 --> 01:48:19,791
I understand I should give you notice.

903
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:25,171
No. You must go when you want.

904
01:48:29,801 --> 01:48:33,555
I'll leave first thing tomorrow. No fuss.

905
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:37,809
I think that's best.

906
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,083
Gabriel.

907
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:31,965
Gabriel.

908
01:50:32,799 --> 01:50:34,175
Wait.

909
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:53,862
You'll think I'm strange but...

910
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:57,824
...I've been worried.
Have I offended you somehow?

911
01:50:57,866 --> 01:50:59,451
No, not at all.

912
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,203
Is it money?

913
01:51:03,121 --> 01:51:06,708
-I'll pay you whatever you want.
-I don't need money now.

914
01:51:07,751 --> 01:51:10,920
-A formal partnership, then?
-Nor a partnership.

915
01:51:11,921 --> 01:51:16,676
The farm belongs to you alone.
It's the finest farm for miles around.

916
01:51:16,718 --> 01:51:20,722
-Then why else are you leaving?
-I said I'd leave you one day.

917
01:51:24,768 --> 01:51:27,145
Well, you must not go.

918
01:51:28,063 --> 01:51:30,732
-You forbid me?
-Yes, if you like.

919
01:51:31,483 --> 01:51:33,068
I forbid you.

920
01:51:35,403 --> 01:51:38,365
It's time for you to fight your own battles.

921
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:40,909
And win them, too.

922
01:51:43,995 --> 01:51:45,997
So we should say goodbye, then?

923
01:51:47,415 --> 01:51:49,167
I suppose so.

924
01:51:59,886 --> 01:52:01,221
Gabriel, wait.

925
01:52:05,975 --> 01:52:07,727
Thank you, Gabriel.

926
01:52:09,437 --> 01:52:11,815
You've believed in me and fought for me...

927
01:52:12,816 --> 01:52:16,319
...and stood by my side when
all the rest of the world is against me.

928
01:52:18,446 --> 01:52:20,907
And we've been through so much together.

929
01:52:25,578 --> 01:52:28,248
Wasn't I your first sweetheart?

930
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:32,043
Weren't you mine?

931
01:52:38,299 --> 01:52:41,052
And now I'd have to go on without you.

932
01:52:45,515 --> 01:52:47,517
If I knew...

933
01:52:52,564 --> 01:52:56,901
If I knew that you would let me love you
and marry you...

934
01:52:56,943 --> 01:52:58,695
But you will never know.

935
01:53:00,697 --> 01:53:02,157
Why not?

936
01:53:03,366 --> 01:53:05,744
Because you never ask!

937
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:08,246
Would you say no again?

938
01:53:10,206 --> 01:53:11,541
I don't know.

939
01:53:13,376 --> 01:53:14,961
Probably.

940
01:53:21,843 --> 01:53:23,678
So why don't you?

941
01:53:25,472 --> 01:53:27,140
Ask me.

942
01:53:31,186 --> 01:53:32,854
Ask me.

943
01:53:37,442 --> 01:53:39,611
Ask me, Gabriel.
