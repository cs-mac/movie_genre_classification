1
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:51,609
Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

2
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:55,482
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.

3
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:59,233
Walnut sideboard.

4
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:01,731
16th-century French decorations

5
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:04,822
of herms
and griffin-shaped cartouches.

6
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:08,072
Embellished deplorably
in the 19th century.

7
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,980
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

8
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,816
Upper section with two doors,

9
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,273
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

10
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:27,863
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

11
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,768
Is it important?

12
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,940
If you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,

13
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,103
I'd be delighted to accept.

14
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,272
I don't remember that.

15
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,402
It may look like mouldy wood,

16
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,692
but centuries ago,
beneath the mould,

17
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,186
there must have been a painting.

18
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,728
- Good evening. How are you?
- Very well.

19
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,729
The management
and staff of Styrorex

20
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,518
would like to offer our best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.

21
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:12,013
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.

22
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,023
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

23
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,727
an ancient recipe
of a Renaissance dessert

24
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,352
made of choux cream
and bitter almonds.

25
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,136
Enjoy.

26
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,019
- Most likely a rash.
- lt must be that.

27
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,138
Was it not to your taste,
Mr. Oldman?

28
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:58,927
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.

29
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:03,312
It is now 10:35pm
and I'm very superstitious.

30
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,103
Pretend I had accepted.

31
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:10,352
The day after tomorrow, then.

32
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,470
The director of the Vatican Museum
wants you to call him back.

33
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:19,347
The reliquary attributed to Cellini,
I presume.

34
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,263
The report on this is ready.

35
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:24,139
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

36
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,551
Send them to my house
except the mobile.

37
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,766
Only one this year.

38
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,762
Good. Word's out that I hate them.

39
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,385
Unless you've changed your habits,
you'll have to answer that.

40
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,599
It's the first call on your birthday.

41
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:38,930
Tradition.

42
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,632
Hello.

43
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,098
I have no wish
to waste your time.

44
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,925
- Who's speaking?
- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.

45
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:50,725
Please don't hang up on me.

46
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:53,677
You're Mr. Oldman's secretary,
aren't you?

47
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:56,422
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.

48
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,849
You see, I... I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.

49
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,721
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
this is not a helpline.

50
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,931
I'm not explaining myself very well.

51
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,672
I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people much.

52
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,554
That's a considerable stroke
of good fortune.

53
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,428
- Talking to people is perilous.
- I'm desperate...

54
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,005
You made the call
so you're running the risk.

55
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,720
It's about the furniture
of my parents' villa.

56
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,925
They... about a year ago.

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,222
- You see?
- I understand.

58
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,802
An estate of great...

59
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,512
I've always heard it referred to
as being of...

60
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,057
Extremely valuable.

61
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,892
Very rare pieces,
including paintings.

62
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,761
Unfortunately,
I have no photographs.

63
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,094
So what?

64
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,797
To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...

65
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:43,344
Oh, I'm out of my depth.
What's the word?

66
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,554
- Valuation.
- Exactly.

67
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:49,090
That is why I asked
to speak to Mr. Oldman.

68
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:52,383
Does Mr. Oldman have the pleasure
of knowing you?

69
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,259
Oh, no, not at all.
He doesn't know me.

70
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,304
But... but I know a lot about him.

71
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:01,798
Mr. Oldman's assistants
are responsible for assessments.

72
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:05,801
- I'll put you through.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

73
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,094
I must speak
to Mr. Oldman in person.

74
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:11,263
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

75
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,388
But you see, before he died,

76
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,175
Dad told me that
if I decided to sell everything,

77
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:19,347
I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.

78
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:23,045
- In his opinion, the best.
- Sold!

79
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:27,345
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

80
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:32,752
a refracting elongated telescope
constructed by Galileo Galilei.

81
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:35,136
It's still in perfect working order.

82
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,876
Can we open bidding,
please, at 1,000,000?

83
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:41,303
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000. 1,200,000.

84
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:45,175
1,300,000.
1,400,000 on the telephone.

85
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:48,138
1,500,000 back in the room.
1,600,000.

86
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,296
1,700,000.
1,800,000 in the room.

87
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,839
1,900,000. 2,000,000.
At 2,000,000.

88
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,631
Gesundheit. Was that a bid?

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,551
At 2,000,000. 2,100,000.

90
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,001
2,300,000 on the telephone.

91
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:07,838
2,500,000. I can sell it. 2,700,000.

92
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,467
At 2,700,000.
Any more? Are we all done?

93
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,551
At 2,700,000.

94
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:16,295
Sold. Congratulations, sir.

95
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,467
Lot 232.

96
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:22,498
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

97
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,674
This one will go to the best offer.

98
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:28,759
1,000. 2,000.

99
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:33,792
3,000. 4,000. 5,000 online.

100
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:38,091
6,000. 7,000.

101
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,751
8,000. 9,000 on the telephone.

102
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,505
10,000 back in the room.
11,000 online.

103
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:48,215
12,000. 13,000 online.
14,000. 15,000.

104
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:51,584
This is not doing my neck any good.

105
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,627
At 15,000.

106
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:58,006
20,000. At 20,000.

107
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:59,834
Any more? Sold!

108
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:17,789
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

109
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,838
You never miss a trick,
do you, governor?

110
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:26,372
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

111
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:29,126
A Russian painter
who died in the late '30s.

112
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,377
An outstanding landscape painter.

113
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:36,333
But among his many landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

114
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,205
Only three in his whole life.

115
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,878
And this is one of the three.

116
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,586
It's double, alright?

117
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:49,620
How long have
we known each other?

118
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:50,998
Quite a while.

119
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,743
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.

120
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,538
Remember Milo Hensen?

121
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:59,793
You were the only one who knew
he was going to be big.

122
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:02,497
We got that portrait of his mother
for a song

123
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,126
from under the noses
of that bunch of idiots.

124
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,794
Must be worth a fortune now.

125
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:10,366
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get more.

126
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,241
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?

127
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,955
- Honestly, no.
- It's been good enough for you.

128
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,367
It's been good enough for me,
you misery.

129
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,701
What matters is that you're satisfied.

130
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:24,121
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you

131
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,665
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

132
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,532
A love of art
and knowing how to hold a brush

133
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,209
doesn't make an artist.

134
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,577
You need an inner mystery.
A knack you've never possessed.

135
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:38,994
You're right. Double wasn't enough.

136
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,410
In my 36 years in this business,

137
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:02,192
never has anyone had the gall
to keep me waiting 40 minutes.

138
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,035
It's a disgrace.
A display of bad manners.

139
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:07,442
Let me explain.
I tried to call.

140
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,693
- There's no excuse.
- I tried to call.

141
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,658
Never come near me again.

142
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,694
Nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.

143
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:16,941
I do not possess a mobile phone.

144
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,398
lt's the lbbetson woman
on the phone.

145
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,403
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying.

146
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,027
Serves her right.

147
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,355
She was hit by a car
on her way to meet you.

148
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:37,401
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

149
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,110
She was left unconscious.

150
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:42,484
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

151
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,190
Alright. Put her through.

152
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,064
- Yes?
- Please forgive me.

153
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:59,774
I had no intention
to be in any way disrespectful.

154
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,904
Nothing too serious, I hope.

155
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:05,440
No. Fortunately,
they'II... they'll let me out tomorrow.

156
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:08,733
Good.
I hope you make a speedy recovery.

157
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,944
Would you consent
to a new appointment?

158
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:15,024
- Please.
- Alright.

159
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,189
But I'm sending an assistant.

160
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,363
I hope it's the same one
I spoke to last time.

161
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,277
What do you mean?

162
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:27,611
Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset

163
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:31,276
that voice could only
have been yours, Mr. Oldman.

164
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,108
Truly surprising,
wouldn't you say?

165
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:37,066
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,

166
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:40,321
part of her dress
and the left side of the background.

167
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,814
Incredible. But what made
Mr. Oldman think that?

168
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,732
- What period is it from?
- Too soon to say.

169
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,440
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out

170
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,735
more quickly and better than us.

171
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,109
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

172
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:58,561
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it wasn't.

173
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,232
I said it wasn't authentic.

174
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,774
From an analysis
of the pigments and wood,

175
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,977
we thought it was pre-17th century.

176
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,690
- Even older.
- Then it must be worth something.

177
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:12,401
It is a work by Valiante,
the female forger of the 16th century.

178
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:14,022
She copied masterpieces,

179
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:16,649
but couldn't sign them
as she was a woman,

180
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:19,067
so she marked them
with a personal code

181
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,105
hidden in the folds of the drapery

182
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,690
or in this case,
in the gaze of the subject.

183
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:27,104
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.

184
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,735
That is Valiante.

185
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:33,477
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.

186
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,394
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

187
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,979
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

188
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,527
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,432
And Miss lbbetson?

190
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:09,979
She sends her apologies,

191
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:12,721
but overnight,
she was running a temperature.

192
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:16,515
She should have called me.
Spared myself a wasted trip.

193
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,523
Well, give her my best wishes.

194
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:21,359
She asked if you would go ahead
with valuation.

195
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,682
She's instructed me
to show you around.

196
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,437
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.

197
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,561
Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

198
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,814
It doesn't matter.
Your mistress didn't show up either.

199
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,145
Fair enough.

200
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:41,602
I suppose
it'll get the job done quicker.

201
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,434
Forgive the mess.

202
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:54,477
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.

203
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:57,809
Let's go up.

204
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:01,645
How long since the owners died?

205
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,565
By the look of it,
you'd think it was centuries ago,

206
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,355
but it's only been one year.

207
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:10,346
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

208
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,767
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

209
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,606
You have a good look.
Take your time.

210
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:16,728
Just getting these curtains open.

211
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,139
Too many windows in this room.

212
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:26,975
Okay.

213
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:34,140
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

214
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,854
None. She is an only child.

215
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,888
- Is she married?
- No.

216
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:40,683
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

217
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,059
I don't think
she even has a boyfriend.

218
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,561
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?
- No, none at all.

219
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,604
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.

220
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,760
So many rooms.

221
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:58,550
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.

222
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,806
Have there been other valuations
before me?

223
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:19,514
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.

224
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:22,644
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond
of this house.

225
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,471
Maybe too fond.

226
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:27,558
She'd prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

227
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:30,685
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.

228
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:35,059
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?

229
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:37,847
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.

230
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,051
She won't get rid of the whole place.

231
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,094
What kind of work does she do?

232
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:45,675
I couldn't say.
I only dealt with her parents.

233
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,930
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

234
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,767
It's a long way down.

235
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,304
Go ahead.

236
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,086
I honestly don't get it.

237
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,472
In the time I've known you,
I've never seen you beaten.

238
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,680
I've watched you produce
all manner of gadgets

239
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,805
from most unremarkable ironwork.

240
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,717
Optical, arithmetical devices,
water clocks...

241
00:20:57,016 --> 00:21:01,304
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

242
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:04,845
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?

243
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,888
I'm surprised that
an art connoisseur like yourself

244
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:10,887
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.

245
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:13,723
It's not the object
that arouses my curiosity,

246
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,263
but it's contradiction.

247
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:18,506
- Contradiction?
- Look.

248
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,094
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,

249
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,299
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

250
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:27,709
What does this mean?

251
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:30,467
The object hadn't been there
for very long.

252
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:34,592
It got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned it upside down.

253
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:38,093
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.

254
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:39,922
Hi. Did you manage it?

255
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,374
Did you ever doubt me?

256
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,256
This works perfectly now.

257
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,923
And I transcribed
the recording from the tape.

258
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,133
You're a genius.
How much do I owe you?

259
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:51,679
Oh, nothing.

260
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:53,719
Maybe you'll invite me out.

261
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:54,965
Count on it.

262
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:57,874
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

263
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,381
That I am good at.

264
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,545
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

265
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,335
William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
The Birth Of Venus.

266
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,333
Authentic.

267
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:16,416
Umberto Veruda,
The Honest, 1890.

268
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,627
You've been
the talk of the town lately.

269
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:39,626
I hoped to see you
on TV.

270
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,633
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in shadow.

271
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,377
We're much the same that way.

272
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:46,257
That doesn't mean we'll agree.

273
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:48,501
My secretary's been looking for you.

274
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:51,674
How do you know that a painter
will become collectable?

275
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:55,457
Intuition, which also makes
me doubt your intentions.

276
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:59,674
Sorry for that impression but I've
entrusted you with my belongings.

277
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,170
That's not how it works.

278
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,294
There must be a signed contract
before the inventory.

279
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,169
It takes time,
and unless you stop fooling around

280
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,043
and decide to come out
it will never get started.

281
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:12,291
Go ahead with the inventory.

282
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:13,924
I'll meet you at the villa.

283
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:15,715
We'll reach an agreement.

284
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:17,293
You have my word.

285
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,707
- Take these.
- Yes.

286
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:20,962
Be careful!

287
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,253
I'm not sure
but it looks German to me.

288
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,914
Austrian. Careful with that.

289
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,295
It's 11:00
The appointment was 8:30.

290
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:32,127
She's not answering.
She said she'll come. She'll be here.

291
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,670
The piano doesn't need restoration.

292
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:35,871
Quite so.

293
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,087
We have to check it
but there's no key.

294
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,500
But here it is.

295
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:41,545
Last time there was no key.

296
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,793
Looks good.

297
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,957
Mr Oldman!

298
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,087
Would you help me
with the bookcase?

299
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:50,208
Italian bookcase, wood. First half
of...

300
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:51,411
Who smashed this?

301
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,913
Nobody, Mr Oldman,
it was already broken.

302
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:56,045
Is this part of the house inhabited?

303
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:57,412
Why?

304
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,497
There have been some changes.

305
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,037
No, no, Mr...

306
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,289
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.

307
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:04,743
I thought you were...

308
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,546
It doesn't matter who I am.

309
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,253
Nobody lives here.

310
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:11,954
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not here by midday

311
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,963
I will have no option but to
suspend operations.

312
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:21,209
Mr Oldman!

313
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:27,160
Miss lbbetson.

314
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,376
Hello, Mr Oldman?

315
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:31,999
Mr Oldman, can you hear me?

316
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,785
Mr Oldman, I apologise.
What must you think of me?

317
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:38,747
Spare me
the self-serving justifications.

318
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:39,951
Let me speak.

319
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,495
I cannot touch your things
without a contract. Is that clear?

320
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,538
Would you leave it on the table
in the hallway?

321
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:49,200
I'll sign it.
I accept all your conditions.

322
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,085
Yes, but I do not accept yours.

323
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:54,666
I will not do business
with a silly, superficial phantom.

324
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:57,746
Be careful!

325
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:00,123
I understand your exasperation.

326
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:03,080
But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.

327
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:07,495
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.

328
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:09,992
So what exactly happened today?

329
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:14,245
My car was stolen and I had to go
to the police to report it.

330
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:17,492
Which police station did you go to?

331
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,660
The one in the city.
- Whereabouts?

332
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:22,620
- On the main square.
- Which square?

333
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:25,122
No more interrogation!

334
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,617
No more!
Who do you think you are?

335
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,459
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

336
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:36,865
What kind of question is that?

337
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,239
Are you here?

338
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,740
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

339
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:43,121
- lf you're here, come out now.
- Stop it!

340
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,575
Explain the meaning of this game
which I do not find amusing.

341
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:48,789
Call me tonight. I'll explain.

342
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,075
lt's the same material

343
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:56,039
and the same workmanship too.

344
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,247
These belong to the same system.

345
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:01,155
There's no signature,
no inscription?

346
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:07,081
I mean when I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.

347
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,530
There's nothing.

348
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:14,827
I can do the same with these but, I
mean, right now I can't see anything.

349
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,489
What have you found?

350
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:24,033
The technique, how the cog
has been attached to it's axis.

351
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,779
It's really old.
I've never seen it before.

352
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,079
Here, look. Have a look.

353
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:39,117
It's 18th century.

354
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,447
We could be onto
something big here.

355
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:43,495
Could you guess what it is?

356
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:47,990
Three pieces of the mosaic
is not enough, Mr Oldman.

357
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,491
In the last few years
the old couple were unwell.

358
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:54,950
The house was in
a terrible state then.

359
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,737
Mr lbbetson always said
that they'd have to sell something.

360
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,036
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

361
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,495
About 27.

362
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:09,277
What else can you tell me
about her?

363
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:10,782
Nothing really.

364
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:14,368
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her.

365
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:18,863
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

366
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:23,824
Well, 11 years to be exact.

367
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:26,112
I don't have much to do with her.

368
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,740
I talk to her often
at all hours but...

369
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,454
But?

370
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,826
I've never seen her.

371
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:36,700
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

372
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,577
Why?

373
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:45,362
Because Miss Claire
suffers from a very strange illness.

374
00:27:46,536 --> 00:27:49,404
- Hello.
- Good evening. It's Oldman.

375
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:51,035
I was expecting your call.

376
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:54,782
I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.

377
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,031
It doesn't matter.

378
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:59,071
But if I confirm I am available,
at the same time

379
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:02,693
I cannot permit this joke in poor taste
to continue any longer.

380
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,654
I wish you to stop
all involvement in my affairs.

381
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,533
I apologise for the trouble.

382
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,657
Send me your bill.
Good night.

383
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:20,072
Lot 93. Valiante.
Portrait of a Lady.

384
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:21,274
16th century,

385
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:24,947
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

386
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:26,232
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

387
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:28,982
I have here an opening
bid of £20,000.

388
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:31,862
- £22,000.
- £22,000.

389
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:34,985
£24,000. £26,000 on the telephone.

390
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,323
£28,000 in the room. £30,000.

391
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,449
£35,000. Thank you, sir.

392
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:44,525
£40,000 on the telephone.
£45,000 in the room.

393
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,028
£50,000.

394
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:50,858
£55,000. £60,000.
£65,000 on the telephone.

395
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,819
£70,000. At £70,000.

396
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:58,115
Any advance on £70,000? £75,000.

397
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:00,487
£80,000 on the telephone.
Any more?

398
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,529
All done at £80,000.

399
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,524
All done at £80,000.

400
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:08,568
£90,000. Any more?

401
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:10,860
Sold.

402
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:14,771
- Thank you, sir.
- I bid £90,000 too.

403
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:18,067
Mr Oldman should have been
aware of that.

404
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,937
I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.
Mr Whistler bid £90,000.

405
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:25,563
- He was the only one.
- They bid simultaneously.

406
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,146
She got her bid in first.
I saw it.

407
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,863
What should we do?

408
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:34,405
I'm the biggest collector of Valiante
forgeries and I'll sue you!

409
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,319
You were too slow, Billy! You didn't
get in with your bid in time.

410
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:40,361
And you were too late. Too late.

411
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,818
You didn't keep up with me
for God's sake!

412
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:45,988
She was behind me.
If I'd seen I'd have bid again.

413
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:48,195
You're losing it!

414
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:49,477
Maybe you're right

415
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,274
but it's not the first time
we've messed up.

416
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:56,109
It's the way things go. Never went
into a rage like this before.

417
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:59,695
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

418
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,483
It was the genuine one
by Petrus Christus.

419
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:05,775
It'll be worth £8 million.

420
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:09,605
Woe be me.

421
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:13,194
I'm sorry. Honestly.

422
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,859
But even when we lost
Van Gogh's Lady With The Fan

423
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,853
you didn't take it this hard.

424
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:22,402
What's going on, Virgil?

425
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,276
642.

426
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,986
729.

427
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,897
918.

428
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,309
1,011.

429
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:39,983
1,119.

430
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,643
1,320.

431
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:45,227
1,404.

432
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:47,774
- What will you have?
- 1,581.

433
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:48,975
Tea, thank you.

434
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,144
8,109.

435
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,441
8,725.

436
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:59,858
Sorry, darling, 8,625.

437
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,597
8,725!

438
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:05,059
8,725.

439
00:31:05,235 --> 00:31:07,273
Take a closer look,
you moron.

440
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:10,691
Shit! You're right, 8,725.
Well done, girl!

441
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,317
That's it?

442
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:25,775
- Bye!
- Bye!

443
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,768
I gave them a clean
with this special fluid.

444
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,817
And I have studied them
by the millimetre

445
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:37,270
and look what's come up.

446
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:39,348
Vaucanson.

447
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,602
I can't believe it!
Jacques Vaucanson.

448
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,931
18th century constructor
of automata.

449
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:49,023
When I was a student
I did my thesis on him.

450
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,183
That's incredible!

451
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:54,522
One of his most famous androids
even managed to talk.

452
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:57,939
Exactly.
People would pay to ask it questions.

453
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:02,978
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.

454
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:05,228
I bet there was someone inside.

455
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:06,855
You know, a dwarf maybe.

456
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:10,721
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
with Maelzel's Chess Player.

457
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:13,103
More than likely.

458
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:15,559
But the mystery
that nobody could explain

459
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,564
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.

460
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,223
Of course there was trickery
in making the automaton talk.

461
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,431
Everything it said was true.

462
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:28,807
You bring me all the pieces.

463
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:33,057
I promise to put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

464
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,474
I don't doubt it

465
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:37,765
but I fear I've lost my chance
to get the missing pieces.

466
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,725
They must be in the same place
you found these.

467
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:43,303
And all I need is 80%
of the elements,

468
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:46,347
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

469
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,429
It's not that easy.

470
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:52,060
I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.

471
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:56,016
Hey, Sarah, this is Mr Virgil Oldman.

472
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,893
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

473
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,096
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.

474
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,269
Don't young people talk about
more exciting things?

475
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:10,263
Why don't you eat with us?

476
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:12,808
That's very kind.
Another time, thank you.

477
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,640
Alright, we won't insist.
We'll promise.

478
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,685
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

479
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:27,474
Cancel New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.

480
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:29,469
We called the meeting.

481
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:32,720
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

482
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,258
Alright, Mr Oldman.

483
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,017
Claire lbbetson phoned.

484
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,506
What does she want now?

485
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:45,759
She asked you to meet her
at 2:30.

486
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:47,891
Meet her where?

487
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,135
At the lbbetson villa.

488
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,720
Where else?

489
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:52,465
I'm extremely grateful to you
for coming, Mr Oldman.

490
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:56,179
How did you know it was me?

491
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:58,553
Fred has a limp. You don't.

492
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,264
Ah.

493
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,716
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

494
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:09,719
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.

495
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:11,169
In fact, your beh...

496
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:12,508
How should I put it?

497
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,304
Speak frankly. Don't worry.

498
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:18,592
I won't deny that your whimsical
little ways

499
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:20,222
are getting a bit tiresome.

500
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,847
I hope not too tiresome.

501
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:29,387
But I wanted to say sorry
for... well, my behaviour.

502
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,926
Typical of a "silly, superficial
woman", as you put it.

503
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,845
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

504
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:39,135
Nothing personal, believe me.

505
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,793
Why would you want to do
business with a person

506
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,129
who arouses such aversion in you

507
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:46,876
that you can't even look him
in the face?

508
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,298
It's hard to explain. You won't
believe me anyway.

509
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:55,010
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.

510
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,636
I don't meet many people.

511
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:00,044
It's been a long time now.

512
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:03,219
I see nothing serious in that.

513
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,585
Everyone has moments

514
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,464
when they prefer solitude
to the multitudes.

515
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:10,469
I haven't left this house
since I was 15.

516
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:14,467
- I don't think I understand.
- You understand perfectly.

517
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:16,213
This is my room.

518
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:19,006
If there's somebody in the house
or in the villa,

519
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,216
I lock myself up in here.

520
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:25,083
I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.

521
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,883
I hardly ever saw them.

522
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,250
I don't see anybody.

523
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:30,297
But why?

524
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:33,670
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?

525
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,842
lt's a question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

526
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,883
You're afraid to touch others.

527
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:41,338
To touch their possessions
disgusts you.

528
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:44,545
I'm afraid of going to places
where others live.

529
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:47,502
These seem to me
very similar personal choices.

530
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:52,374
You'd like me to believe you haven't
walked a street in 12 years?

531
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:53,915
I see you know my age.

532
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,170
Being a hermit and employing
a caretaker doesn't add up.

533
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,790
I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know,

534
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:05,084
inside the villa
when there's nobody here,

535
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:08,210
which is often now,
but I never go out.

536
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:11,539
The very idea paralyses me.

537
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:16,255
I hope you understand me now.

538
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,875
I hope that, within the limits
of your work, you'll help me.

539
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:23,172
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

540
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,753
As to any agreement between us,
I leave it to you to set your fee.

541
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,204
I trust you blindly.

542
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,505
Leave the contract on the table.

543
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:35,668
You'll find it signed next time.

544
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:37,419
Now, please, I'm very tired.

545
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,503
Apart from your fondness
for my gloves,

546
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:54,878
what made you decide
to call me again?

547
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:56,375
I haven't been kind.

548
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,919
I was taken by the way you
were looking at my house yesterday

549
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,500
from the bar opposite.

550
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,296
You found the missing pieces.

551
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:12,079
In the meantime
make do with this one.

552
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:14,330
How much would the
automaton be worth

553
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:16,793
if we manage to make it work?

554
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,871
Think of a really, really high figure.

555
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,500
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

556
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,917
You've probably pitched it
too low.

557
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,004
You're good at talking
without saying anything.

558
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,460
I'll take that as a compliment.

559
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,410
Should things go
the way I trust they will,

560
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:36,626
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.

561
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:40,908
I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

562
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,664
Where did you find these?

563
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:46,204
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

564
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,667
It's forbidden to reveal
one's sources.

565
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:00,251
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

566
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,952
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

567
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:05,159
Of course.

568
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:07,493
Candlesticks.

569
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:10,419
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

570
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,414
Mr Oldman.

571
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:20,532
Mr Oldman.

572
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:22,873
Yes.

573
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,042
What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?

574
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:28,284
We're only drawing up
the inventory.

575
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:30,580
Later you can tell me
what to leave out.

576
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:31,829
Thank you.

577
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,036
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

578
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,615
I'm sorry to have
intruded on your thoughts.

579
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:42,369
That's not the point.

580
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:45,163
I've been wondering how you
can live like this.

581
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:47,408
I'm organised and self-sufficient,

582
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,417
I don't need any help
but I appreciate your concern.

583
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:51,912
You're welcome.

584
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,244
- See you soon, then.
- Have a good day.

585
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:00,746
Mr Oldman!

586
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,208
Your contract.

587
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,950
I read it and it seems fine to me.

588
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,820
I initialled every page
and signed the last.

589
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,823
That's how it's done, isn't it?

590
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,112
Perfect.

591
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,577
But your personal details
are missing.

592
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,825
Take them from my passport.

593
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:48,405
But it expired quite some time ago.

594
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:52,160
- Personal details never expire.
- That's true enough, I suppose.

595
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:55,199
I was just a girl then
but it'll do for your purposes.

596
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:13,032
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases

597
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,954
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

598
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:17,319
You know best.

599
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:20,245
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

600
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:22,735
We can widen
the scope of the valuation.

601
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,193
I understand.

602
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,402
You dye your hair.
I never noticed.

603
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:45,407
I'm disgusted by people
who don't trust their own hair!

604
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,411
I don't trust people who think so
much of themselves

605
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:50,405
that they won't come outside.

606
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:55,774
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

607
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:58,904
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

608
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:02,194
- The matter is of no interest to me.
- These are the keys.

609
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:07,404
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

610
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:10,445
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

611
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:15,359
When you come in, slam the door,

612
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,155
otherwise she'll get scared
and panic.

613
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,284
I'm going off my head

614
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:35,200
trying to work out the alignment
of these devices,

615
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:38,069
trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.

616
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,613
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

617
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:44,570
You know,
gearboxes are like people.

618
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,697
If they've been together
long enough,

619
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:50,356
eventually,
they take on each other's forms.

620
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:55,608
So, you believe time can make
any kind of cohabitation possible?

621
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,359
Yeah, well, absolutely.

622
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,947
You've reminded me of a friend
who met a much younger girl.

623
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:02,658
She had agoraphobia.

624
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:05,147
Fear of open spaces
and distances?

625
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:09,438
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

626
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:14,947
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

627
00:43:15,116 --> 00:43:17,272
he's been in a state of...

628
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:20,239
...permanent anxiety.

629
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:26,529
What did I tell you? Now
he'll be constantly worried about her.

630
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:27,944
He'll be thinking,

631
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:31,979
"What does she need, shampoo,
medicine, tights... yoghurt?"

632
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:33,865
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

633
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:36,232
I'm not so sure.

634
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,362
Tell your friend to stay calm,

635
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,363
'cause time is already
working on their gearboxes.

636
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:52,526
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

637
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:59,774
- Are you angry with me?
- Why should I be?

638
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:02,518
- What I said about your hair.
- Not at all.

639
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,899
I was just calling to ask

640
00:44:05,073 --> 00:44:09,231
if you wish the sale of the furniture
to be identified by your family name.

641
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,277
Or do you prefer anonymity?

642
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,983
- Anonymity, anonymity.
- Good.

643
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,938
This time, I did see you.

644
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:18,606
- Oh?
- On TV.

645
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,778
I don't generally give interviews
but I was forced to.

646
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:23,772
You're more intriguing this way.

647
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:26,612
You'll be a great success
with the ladies.

648
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:28,983
So, we go to Lot 132.

649
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:31,690
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.

650
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:37,101
1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.

651
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:39,649
This one goes to the best offer.

652
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,610
£10,000.

653
00:44:51,445 --> 00:44:54,892
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered in days.

654
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,309
It's a while
since I heard from her.

655
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,311
I've been in bed all week, ill.

656
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,441
Who's been bringing her food?

657
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:10,806
Miss lbbetson?

658
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:19,067
Miss lbbetson?

659
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:31,522
Miss lbbetson? Answer me!

660
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:37,313
Claire?

661
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:40,399
Claire, are you alright?

662
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,689
Oh, no. Please!

663
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,814
- No. It's me, Claire.
- Get out!

664
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:47,855
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- Go away!

665
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:50,311
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- Get out!

666
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:53,020
There's nobody else here.
Calm down.

667
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:55,229
What's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

668
00:45:56,483 --> 00:45:57,975
I wasn't well.

669
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,187
I didn't know who to call.

670
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,520
Nobody answered.

671
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,014
And then I fell.

672
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,142
I fell and I hit my...

673
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:09,189
Open the door.

674
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:11,065
You need to see a doctor.

675
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:14,067
No, please! Please!

676
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,722
Please, no!

677
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:22,019
Can you fix a broken auctioneer
as well?

678
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:24,146
I wouldn't know where to begin.

679
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,804
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Oldman.

680
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:30,597
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

681
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:32,729
Too many woodworms
and spider webs

682
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:35,137
and too few masterpieces.

683
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:36,855
Could we put it that way?

684
00:46:38,148 --> 00:46:40,718
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

685
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,979
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

686
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:49,553
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

687
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,477
The entire exterior.

688
00:46:52,814 --> 00:46:55,645
We can't establish
what kind of character he is.

689
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,469
Like my friend
and his girl in the tower.

690
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:01,681
Yeah, maybe, although
we've never seen our android.

691
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:04,010
We're still groping around
in the dark.

692
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,729
So is he.

693
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:08,386
He speaks to her
through a closed door.

694
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,803
- Closed door?
- Yes.

695
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:15,055
If anybody moves in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.

696
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:19,554
- He's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no-one has.

697
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,727
That's like when two young people
meet on the internet.

698
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:26,179
They get to know each other,
then reveal themselves.

699
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:28,060
She won't reveal herself.

700
00:47:28,396 --> 00:47:31,096
Maybe he hasn't
got a good strategy.

701
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:36,141
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise

702
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,263
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

703
00:47:39,437 --> 00:47:43,265
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

704
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:44,977
Well...

705
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:47,726
...here's one more.

706
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:51,220
That's a mobile phone.

707
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:53,549
This is brand new.

708
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:57,009
I'm the one that's rusty
because I don't know how to use it.

709
00:47:57,353 --> 00:48:00,303
Could you teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?

710
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:21,882
- Hello.
- Good evening, Mr. Oldman.

711
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,429
It's Claire Ibbetson.
Am I disturbing you?

712
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,556
No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

713
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:30,221
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.

714
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:31,932
I wanted to thank you for...

715
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:34,635
...everything, really.

716
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:38,221
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

717
00:48:38,392 --> 00:48:41,390
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.

718
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,343
I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.

719
00:48:44,683 --> 00:48:46,922
Oh! What do you think?

720
00:48:48,183 --> 00:48:50,505
You've done a great job.
Really, you have.

721
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:53,881
But I'm troubled
by so many doubts.

722
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:57,755
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to sell. What would you advise?

723
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,717
I couldn't say. I don't know
what your plans are.

724
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:03,628
Why did you decide
to sell in the first place?

725
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,671
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or another reason?

726
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:09,970
All of the above, I suppose.

727
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:13,174
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.

728
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:17,010
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.

729
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:19,219
I'd like something smaller.

730
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,297
But the idea of having to leave here

731
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:23,759
and go somewhere else
fills me with dread.

732
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:25,554
How would I manage it?

733
00:49:25,723 --> 00:49:29,005
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?

734
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:32,511
I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off.

735
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,548
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind.

736
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:41,798
- You think?
- Well, until the catalogue is printed.

737
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:46,084
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.

738
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:48,337
That's the biggest torment of all.

739
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:50,836
When I think about it,
I can't even work.

740
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:53,419
I didn't know you were working.

741
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:57,921
I write. I write novels, stories,
things like that.

742
00:49:58,264 --> 00:50:00,383
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.

743
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,125
Luckily for us,
you'll never manage to.

744
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,845
Why not?

745
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:08,758
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.

746
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:12,094
Artists always loathe
what they make, Miss lbbetson.

747
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:14,217
Yesterday, you called me Claire.

748
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:19,213
I wasn't aware.
I was in a state of alarm.

749
00:50:19,387 --> 00:50:21,757
- Sorry.
- I'd like you to continue.

750
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,215
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.

751
00:50:27,387 --> 00:50:28,926
Well, what did he say?

752
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:32,092
He was taken back but he went
along with what she wanted.

753
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:33,886
What else could he do?

754
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:37,300
I'd have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.

755
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,962
That's not his style.

756
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,087
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

757
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:44,666
Then he'll never get her out of there.

758
00:50:44,843 --> 00:50:48,007
I don't
think my friend intends to court her.

759
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,092
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

760
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,458
Horrible voice!

761
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:56,049
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

762
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:59,050
'Desired's probably
not the right word.

763
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:03,129
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

764
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:06,383
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

765
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:07,879
There might be a way.

766
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,541
Just depends on how brave
your friend is.

767
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:14,330
- The French bureau.
- Yes.

768
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:18,372
- The table with the roll top.
- No, I'd like to keep that.

769
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:21,466
That's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.

770
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,708
- OK.
- One last thing, Claire.

771
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:27,747
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

772
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:31,042
In a studio. I don't want
many people around the house.

773
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:34,050
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

774
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,131
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.

775
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:40,339
When will we next see each other?

776
00:51:41,676 --> 00:51:46,332
You mean, when do you see me?
Since I am not given that privilege.

777
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:49,753
- Forgive me.
- But soon.

778
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,997
- Have a good day.
- You too.

779
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:30,663
Hello?

780
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:59,159
- I can't believe it.
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

781
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:02,415
I had to do something to make
you forgive me.

782
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:04,326
But how did you get it?

783
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:07,749
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times,

784
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:12,622
so I persuaded her to sell it to me
for £250,000.

785
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,997
Hmm, not exactly cheap!

786
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,157
I thought it was a reasonable price.

787
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,490
You were talking about £8 million.

788
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,906
This way,
everyone gets a good deal.

789
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:25,163
How much do you want, Billy?

790
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:27,951
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.

791
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,162
Now you're really losing your grip.

792
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,656
I just want to get back
to where we were.

793
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:35,749
How was your friend,
your accomplice,

794
00:54:36,082 --> 00:54:38,120
your trusted procurer of women?

795
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:43,487
lf you're doing this to win back my
trust, it's been a bad deal for you.

796
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,203
You never lost it in the first place.

797
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,448
Oh!

798
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,037
This is great.
This is great!

799
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,115
You found important stuff.

800
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,161
Best bit is this.

801
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:03,325
- An ear.
- A step forward, wouldn't you say?

802
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:06,119
I'd say!
I'd say we're at a turning point.

803
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,533
Look.

804
00:55:13,664 --> 00:55:15,371
- Huh?
- Excellent.

805
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:18,194
The pieces are attracting each other.

806
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:19,403
So...

807
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:23,994
How did things go with your... friend?

808
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:30,323
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?

809
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:32,322
Quite a few, to be honest.

810
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,115
Let me confess,
I didn't follow your advice.

811
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:40,245
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

812
00:55:40,413 --> 00:55:41,989
Yeah, OK, I see your point.

813
00:56:03,078 --> 00:56:07,154
The mathematical set
of a six-day week.

814
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:13,401
The mathematical set
of a 51-minute hour.

815
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:17,571
- What will you have, sir?
- Tea, please.

816
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:19,867
Have you thought of anything else?

817
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:22,656
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.

818
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:25,067
Your tea's ready, sir.

819
00:56:25,244 --> 00:56:28,988
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.

820
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,444
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

821
00:56:36,578 --> 00:56:39,195
The vertical position of a sphere.

822
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,867
I brought the furniture
and painting valuations.

823
00:56:44,035 --> 00:56:47,447
Look at them carefully because
you'll have to authorise them.

824
00:56:47,618 --> 00:56:51,564
- I don't know a thing about this.
- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.

825
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:54,574
You've been spending time
in the cellars recently.

826
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:58,404
- Is that why you changed the locks?
- I change them every six months.

827
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:04,151
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct

828
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:07,277
when dealing with
odds and ends in cellars.

829
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,902
It's how I work.
If it upsets you, speak now.

830
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:13,945
You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.

831
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,488
Thank you for your trust.

832
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:22,814
Were you offended
at being locked out?

833
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:24,187
No, but I was worried.

834
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:28,614
You're right, I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:34,320
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

836
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:38,237
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.

837
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:42,525
My mother thought
I was faking it the first time.

838
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:44,072
We were abroad.

839
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,238
I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower

840
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:48,816
that it paralysed me.

841
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,942
I started screaming,
fell to the ground.

842
00:57:52,115 --> 00:57:55,315
I was just a little girl, but it kept
happening more and more

843
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,030
and she had to believe me.

844
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:58,987
Has there ever been an open space

845
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:01,525
where you weren't overcome
by anxiety?

846
00:58:01,698 --> 00:58:06,439
Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.

847
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:08,900
The square
with the astronomical clock.

848
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:13,066
I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.

849
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,521
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.

850
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:21,186
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that.

851
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,820
I was really happy there.

852
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:26,643
It was called Night and Day.

853
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:31,064
- You've never been back?
- Never.

854
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:36,268
Why not go now?
I'd be happy to take you.

855
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:45,397
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.

856
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:49,813
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.

857
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,392
No, I'm delighted.
You're a force of nature.

858
00:58:54,695 --> 00:58:55,939
It's just that...

859
00:58:57,111 --> 00:58:58,900
...this is one of those evenings

860
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,606
when one feels like this contraption
here...

861
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,814
...incomplete.

862
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:13,066
Why did you never marry?
You know, never have kids?

863
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,853
The regard I have for women

864
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:18,025
is equal to the fear
I've always had of them...

865
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:20,683
...and to my failure
to understand them.

866
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,023
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson

867
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:27,641
gives every impression
of being the exception.

868
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:28,980
I'm afraid so.

869
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,854
Have you really never
set eyes on her?

870
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:33,188
Just once.

871
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:35,609
What's she like?

872
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:39,438
I suppose feeling a certain interest
in a person

873
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:43,189
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.

874
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,018
Up to a point.

875
00:59:46,777 --> 00:59:50,437
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.

876
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,852
I don't think useful
is probably your best approach.

877
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,649
- No?
- Not the first time.

878
00:59:56,816 --> 00:59:59,815
It's better to get her something
more... traditional.

879
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,096
Morning, sir.

880
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:10,349
Hello, sir.

881
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:13,559
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.

882
01:00:14,816 --> 01:00:17,103
I saw you were interested
in this old junk.

883
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:20,603
The supports for
the Murano chandelier.

884
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:22,895
My colleagues couldn't find them.

885
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:26,265
- I can put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

886
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,267
Wait.

887
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:32,185
Oh, thanks.

888
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:35,678
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

889
01:00:37,232 --> 01:00:40,680
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.

890
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:42,558
Happy birthday, Claire.

891
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:48,271
I read
the valuation documents.

892
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:50,679
Did you manage to understand
some of it?

893
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,893
Of course.
Ridiculous sums of money.

894
01:00:53,064 --> 01:00:56,062
Even a backwards child
would know she's being cheated.

895
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:59,063
They need interpretation.
They're starting bids.

896
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:02,313
- There'll be higher bids later.
- Suppose there aren't!

897
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,229
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out.

898
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,719
We'll raise the margins
on other pieces.

899
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:10,515
A gamble? Where I'm the only one
that can lose?

900
01:01:10,688 --> 01:01:13,769
You're trying to cheat me.
It's all to your advantage.

901
01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:15,562
You're a fucking thief!

902
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:19,479
I'm willing to resign
the commission forthwith.

903
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:21,717
Huh!

904
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:27,307
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.

905
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,099
And do me the favour
of disappearing completely

906
01:01:30,272 --> 01:01:31,729
from the face of the earth!

907
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,851
1984, sir.

908
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,848
- Hello.
- I behaved so badly.

909
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:46,224
I feel so stupid. I constantly have
to offer justifications.

910
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:51,220
I've never been given flowers
before.

911
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:56,297
I don't know what this says to me.

912
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,761
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.

913
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:08,212
My birthdays have always been
so horrible.

914
01:03:10,058 --> 01:03:11,764
And you...

915
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:13,389
Since you came along...

916
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:17,467
...you've turned my life upside down.

917
01:03:20,182 --> 01:03:22,931
The other day, I went downstairs.

918
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:28,176
I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.

919
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,302
- Did you go out?
- No.

920
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,971
I was afraid.

921
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:37,679
I felt terrible.

922
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,635
But I never even got that far before.

923
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:47,222
Do you want me to come over?

924
01:03:49,054 --> 01:03:50,761
I already know it's pointless.

925
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:54,011
There are new treatments
nowadays. They might help you.

926
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,467
I'd rather talk to you
than to some shrink.

927
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,845
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Yes.

928
01:04:04,514 --> 01:04:07,084
I see you brought up
the portrait of the dancer.

929
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:10,011
- It's something I want to keep.
- No great value.

930
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,130
It's a portrait of my mother.

931
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:15,508
She was about my age
when she had it done.

932
01:04:19,637 --> 01:04:21,046
Do you look like her?

933
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:24,717
- She was prettier, I can assure you.
- I cannot judge.

934
01:04:34,262 --> 01:04:35,754
Alright, Claire. I'll go.

935
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:39,128
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.

936
01:04:39,303 --> 01:04:41,378
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.

937
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,256
Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

938
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:35,123
No, I would've called you,
it's just that...

939
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,133
...clearing the furniture
has been complicated.

940
01:05:39,592 --> 01:05:41,962
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

941
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:46,621
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.

942
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:50,752
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.

943
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:53,089
I know I can trust him.

944
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:56,589
Why? Are you jealous?

945
01:05:57,217 --> 01:06:00,048
In love? No, I don't think so.

946
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:03,005
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody.

947
01:06:05,173 --> 01:06:07,578
Oh no, it's nothing.
I... I hurt my foot.

948
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:09,582
Can we talk later?

949
01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:36,458
Who is it?

950
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:38,879
Who's there?

951
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:42,416
No, get out!
No, please, get out!

952
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:45,124
Go away! Get out!

953
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,503
Get out! Please, leave me alone!

954
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,921
Get out!

955
01:06:54,588 --> 01:06:56,128
Get out!

956
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:15,240
- Hello?
- Please, help me, please.

957
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:18,074
Calm down, Claire.
What's happened?

958
01:07:18,337 --> 01:07:21,039
You have to help me!
Help me!

959
01:07:21,295 --> 01:07:24,210
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Please.

960
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:21,334
Claire!

961
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:25,489
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- There's somebody in the house!

962
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:28,741
- Please get them out!
- Calm down. There's nobody here.

963
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:31,286
- There's someone in the house!
- Calm down.

964
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,658
It was me before, Claire.
It was me.

965
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,791
It was me.

966
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,111
I hid in the room so I could see you.

967
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:47,081
You were spying on me?

968
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,282
You were spying on me?

969
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,332
Get out!

970
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:55,616
I want nothing more to do with you!
Get out!

971
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:08,308
Please, Virgil. Don't go.

972
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:29,185
Believe me,
I don't normally behave like this...

973
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:32,317
Neither do I.

974
01:09:33,318 --> 01:09:36,436
So I'm bound to make some
mistakes...

975
01:09:38,903 --> 01:09:42,432
...but nothing in the world
would make me want to hurt you.

976
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:46,891
It's just that I can't help myself.

977
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,982
I need to see you.

978
01:10:27,525 --> 01:10:29,349
You should've seen her.

979
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:33,517
Pale, like a Durer etching.

980
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:37,396
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

981
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:40,481
And I could read my own terror
in her eyes.

982
01:10:40,816 --> 01:10:45,354
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

983
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:56,265
- You've worked a miracle.
- It's too soon to tell.

984
01:10:56,648 --> 01:11:00,309
And you be careful, alright?
This is when mistakes occur.

985
01:11:00,648 --> 01:11:02,603
When you think you've made it,

986
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:04,771
that is when you lose strategy.

987
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:09,053
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

988
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:13,852
Do things they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

989
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:17,021
You're asking me to behave
in a way that isn't me.

990
01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:19,430
That's why you have to do it.

991
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,979
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

992
01:11:23,147 --> 01:11:26,347
you're always gonna make her
feel like... like a patient.

993
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,926
She needs to be treated
like a woman.

994
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:01,760
What do you think? Do you like it?

995
01:12:05,604 --> 01:12:07,144
I don't know.

996
01:12:08,436 --> 01:12:09,977
What do you think?

997
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,968
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.

998
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:15,350
Perhaps the smaller size?

999
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:18,847
Yes. I think so too.

1000
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:35,393
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.

1001
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,430
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

1002
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:43,558
I'm a little,
you know, taken a back.

1003
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:52,639
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

1004
01:12:54,558 --> 01:12:55,755
Oh, certainly.

1005
01:12:56,642 --> 01:12:59,557
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

1006
01:13:08,142 --> 01:13:11,223
I don't honestly know
if I deserve all this.

1007
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,012
Let me be the judge of that.

1008
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:38,183
If we don't set a date
for the Stockholm auction,

1009
01:13:38,349 --> 01:13:39,841
they'll shoot themselves.

1010
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,502
It's too far.
Let them shoot themselves.

1011
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:48,428
We have to schedule the meeting
with the Hermitage

1012
01:13:48,765 --> 01:13:51,514
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.

1013
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,139
Ditto. Too far away.

1014
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:56,963
- We can't abandon them.
- There are auctioneers galore.

1015
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,053
They'll find someone else
and it will cost them less.

1016
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:01,501
As you wish.

1017
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:09,010
Lambert, are you married?

1018
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:12,384
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

1019
01:14:12,721 --> 01:14:15,257
What's it like, living with a woman?

1020
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:17,512
Like taking part in an auction.

1021
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:21,343
You never know if yours
will be the best offer.

1022
01:14:48,137 --> 01:14:49,713
- This one.
- Very well, sir.

1023
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:54,385
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?

1024
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:58,666
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- Liar.

1025
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:01,214
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for years.

1026
01:15:01,552 --> 01:15:04,551
I've forgotten how to do it.
I look like a monster.

1027
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,633
Trust me. Some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

1028
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:10,256
And you'll take me to
one of your auctions,

1029
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:12,335
and to galas with elegant people,

1030
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:16,124
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.

1031
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:20,463
That's the reason for your
presents, isn't it, Virgil?

1032
01:15:21,427 --> 01:15:24,673
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.

1033
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,799
Isn't that right?

1034
01:15:29,219 --> 01:15:30,675
No!

1035
01:15:30,844 --> 01:15:33,083
Claire. Don't be like this.
Let's talk.

1036
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:41,585
Maybe we did get the last moves
wrong. I was a bit rash.

1037
01:15:41,967 --> 01:15:43,460
Don't blame yourself.

1038
01:15:43,635 --> 01:15:47,000
It's always her who manages
to pull everything apart.

1039
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,547
Robert. My aunt's gone missing
again.

1040
01:15:49,718 --> 01:15:51,423
- You're kidding.
- Pardon me.

1041
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:54,874
- We found her in Central Park.
- I'm sorry, Terry.

1042
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:57,964
It was no good
trying to reset this thing.

1043
01:15:58,133 --> 01:16:01,464
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

1044
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:04,169
This one has a much wider range.

1045
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:06,831
She can go off
and you won't lose touch.

1046
01:16:07,175 --> 01:16:09,710
Just make sure
you reprogram the PC, okay?

1047
01:16:09,882 --> 01:16:12,038
I can manage that.
You're an angel.

1048
01:16:12,966 --> 01:16:14,756
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

1049
01:16:15,633 --> 01:16:18,465
- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:25,834
You need an idea that'll excite her
but at the same time reassure her.

1051
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:30,622
Yes, but she'll still see through it
as some deceitful therapy.

1052
01:16:30,923 --> 01:16:34,289
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!

1053
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,166
At the climax of the evening,
by candlelight,

1054
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:39,793
tell her that she's beautiful.

1055
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:42,252
And after
you'll have coffee with us?

1056
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,130
Why not?

1057
01:16:46,047 --> 01:16:50,421
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.

1058
01:16:50,798 --> 01:16:53,629
I'm sure you'd understand
far more than I.

1059
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:57,460
Who said anything about joking?

1060
01:16:59,006 --> 01:17:03,214
129,403.

1061
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:05,087
Your champagne.

1062
01:17:05,714 --> 01:17:07,751
- Thank you.
- Calculate this.

1063
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:14,668
12,624,831.333.

1064
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:18,630
Unbelievable!

1065
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,745
You're radiant, Claire.

1066
01:17:27,795 --> 01:17:29,205
You did all this?

1067
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:32,081
I can turn my hand
to interior decorating.

1068
01:17:41,043 --> 01:17:44,540
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.

1069
01:17:50,543 --> 01:17:54,075
I can't tell you how long I've wanted
to spend time alone with you.

1070
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:57,915
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.

1071
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:05,409
To your serenity, Claire.

1072
01:18:08,002 --> 01:18:09,708
To your irony, Virgil.

1073
01:18:15,752 --> 01:18:18,121
- Now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

1074
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,994
You are more beautiful than the
dancer.

1075
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:25,202
Dinner is served.

1076
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:28,074
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

1077
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,787
I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not the best.

1078
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,497
I offer no guarantees.

1079
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,326
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

1080
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:40,992
- Why?
- lf the service is not to your liking,

1081
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,323
next time I'd have to
make a reservation

1082
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:45,124
at the best restaurant in town.

1083
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,912
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.

1084
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:53,531
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- Alright.

1085
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:56,541
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about your past.

1086
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:00,115
You see, there's nothing
very original about my life.

1087
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:03,575
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage...

1088
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:07,328
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy

1089
01:19:07,499 --> 01:19:10,912
by making him work with a restorer
who had a workshop there.

1090
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:12,991
That's beautiful.

1091
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,370
He loved to observe
this craftsman,

1092
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:19,368
so the little boy got up to
all sorts of mischief

1093
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:22,455
to ensure he'd be punished
as often as possible.

1094
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,449
So he became acquainted with art,

1095
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:28,570
techniques of painting,
how to tell a forgery from an original

1096
01:19:28,749 --> 01:19:30,538
etc., etc.

1097
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:35,695
In an old article of yours
I found on the internet, you said,

1098
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:39,286
"There's something authentic
in every forgery."

1099
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:41,032
What did you mean?

1100
01:19:41,205 --> 01:19:43,280
When simulating another's work

1101
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:47,575
the forger can't resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

1102
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:50,862
Often it's just a trifle,
a detail of no interest.

1103
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:52,781
One unsuspected stroke,

1104
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,202
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

1105
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:59,821
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.

1106
01:20:00,788 --> 01:20:03,028
I really love the way you talk.

1107
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:05,741
You couldn't have been
more convincing.

1108
01:20:05,912 --> 01:20:07,703
Huh? A born seducer.

1109
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:12,078
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

1110
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:15,031
Sorry, you've been
a bit neglected lately.

1111
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:19,447
You haven't said
anything about Claire.

1112
01:20:20,246 --> 01:20:23,907
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was normal.

1113
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:27,618
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

1114
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:30,406
Really. I liked her.

1115
01:20:30,578 --> 01:20:32,534
You're going to make me jealous?

1116
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,950
lf you want my advice,
you pray that girl never gets better.

1117
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:38,857
Do you want lots 87 and 88
done separately?

1118
01:20:39,036 --> 01:20:41,407
No, together. That's important.

1119
01:20:47,868 --> 01:20:49,775
How can I help you?

1120
01:20:51,494 --> 01:20:53,899
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

1121
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:57,284
Don't be afraid to tell me.

1122
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:02,244
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.

1123
01:21:02,576 --> 01:21:04,945
All those girls hovering around him...

1124
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,742
I guess I'm just...

1125
01:21:08,326 --> 01:21:09,949
...l'm afraid of losing him.

1126
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:12,906
Is there anything I can do?

1127
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,784
Do you want me to talk to him?

1128
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:22,033
For a while now he's been
talking about someone called Claire.

1129
01:21:24,492 --> 01:21:26,033
Claire?

1130
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:28,864
I don't understand

1131
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:33,442
With him everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.

1132
01:21:33,782 --> 01:21:35,525
That goes for you, too.

1133
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:40,323
I feel so stupid.

1134
01:21:43,617 --> 01:21:45,986
Promise me you won't say a word
to him.

1135
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:48,732
I promise.

1136
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,437
Have you been
waiting long?

1137
01:21:56,617 --> 01:21:59,366
lf you'd phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.

1138
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:02,198
- I prefer to see you.
- Is something wrong?

1139
01:22:02,531 --> 01:22:04,439
My assistant will come by today.

1140
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:07,613
Kindly hand over the
Vaucanson as it is.

1141
01:22:07,782 --> 01:22:09,855
Alright. Whatever you want.

1142
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,688
Tell him how much you're owed.
He'll pay you.

1143
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,736
Aren't I at least due an explanation?

1144
01:22:16,906 --> 01:22:19,856
You're not the trustworthy man
I thought you were.

1145
01:22:21,864 --> 01:22:25,230
lt's weird seeing them so
perfect and polished up.

1146
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,029
It's as if they weren't mine.

1147
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,276
I believe nothing is missing.

1148
01:22:41,446 --> 01:22:43,070
There is something missing.

1149
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:07,771
How could you have lived
the best years of your life in here?

1150
01:23:08,528 --> 01:23:11,646
I don't know. I don't know.

1151
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,902
It was just the right thing.

1152
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:18,937
"Was."

1153
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:22,277
lt still is.

1154
01:23:22,612 --> 01:23:24,152
It always will be.

1155
01:23:24,903 --> 01:23:26,444
Always.

1156
01:23:33,486 --> 01:23:37,183
You have to get out of here.
You have to do it by yourself.

1157
01:23:38,194 --> 01:23:40,066
I don't have the courage.

1158
01:23:42,236 --> 01:23:45,482
It's a spider's web that
I don't know how to break free of.

1159
01:23:49,944 --> 01:23:52,348
It's an old collection
my father was fond of.

1160
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:54,814
I never did understand what it was.

1161
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:04,686
Hello?
Good morning, director.

1162
01:24:05,776 --> 01:24:07,648
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

1163
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:10,889
But I would like to rewrite
the last chapter.

1164
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:13,642
A more upbeat ending.

1165
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:17,606
If that's all you want...

1166
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:21,357
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

1167
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:27,058
I wouldn't rule out them
being part of something valuable,

1168
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:29,271
but exactly what I couldn't say.

1169
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:32,096
- I often wonder if...
- What?

1170
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:35,314
lf you're more interested
in my furniture than in me.

1171
01:24:37,066 --> 01:24:39,140
How could you say that?

1172
01:24:40,983 --> 01:24:43,897
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.

1173
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,893
I've found all the missing pieces.

1174
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,476
How do you feel about
finishing the job?

1175
01:25:13,356 --> 01:25:15,263
Well, it's your problem.

1176
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:19,477
Sarah came to see me
a few days ago.

1177
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:21,887
She was upset
about your relationship.

1178
01:25:25,356 --> 01:25:29,763
- Are you here to advise me now?
- No, you're the expert on women.

1179
01:25:31,105 --> 01:25:33,771
Alright.
We can pick up where we left off.

1180
01:25:34,105 --> 01:25:35,266
On two conditions.

1181
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:39,267
You just stop involving me
in your private life.

1182
01:25:40,522 --> 01:25:41,600
And the second?

1183
01:25:47,437 --> 01:25:48,894
Is that you take this back.

1184
01:25:54,313 --> 01:25:57,928
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

1185
01:26:01,395 --> 01:26:03,303
I brought it back. It's in the car.

1186
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:05,469
And the new pieces too?

1187
01:26:05,812 --> 01:26:09,887
You'll have to be patient for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

1188
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:13,060
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

1189
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:18,560
If you were forced to choose
between Claire and the automaton,

1190
01:26:18,893 --> 01:26:20,802
which would you take?

1191
01:26:28,185 --> 01:26:31,551
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

1192
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:33,221
If it's the wrong size,

1193
01:26:33,394 --> 01:26:36,511
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.

1194
01:26:36,686 --> 01:26:38,391
Thank you, I'll let her know.

1195
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:40,433
Claire? lt's me.

1196
01:26:55,767 --> 01:27:00,507
Claire! I've brought lunch.

1197
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,683
Claire!

1198
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:18,131
Claire, answer me!

1199
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,390
Claire!

1200
01:27:23,101 --> 01:27:24,640
Claire!

1201
01:27:26,476 --> 01:27:28,015
Claire!

1202
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,216
Are you down here?

1203
01:27:40,724 --> 01:27:43,426
Claire!

1204
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:21,130
Have any of you seen a woman

1205
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:24,220
going out the gate
of the villa across the road?

1206
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:25,847
No, I can't say I have.

1207
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,212
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

1208
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,304
A young woman.
Medium height, light hair.

1209
01:28:32,637 --> 01:28:35,126
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

1210
01:28:35,471 --> 01:28:36,750
I didn't see her go out,

1211
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:39,134
but she was walking away
from the gate.

1212
01:28:39,472 --> 01:28:41,757
- When?
- This morning at breakfast.

1213
01:28:42,096 --> 01:28:45,259
- What else can you tell me?
- She seemed a bit weird.

1214
01:28:45,596 --> 01:28:49,920
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

1215
01:28:50,262 --> 01:28:52,004
231.

1216
01:28:52,346 --> 01:28:55,593
Idiot!

1217
01:28:57,761 --> 01:28:59,966
- Hello? Virgil?
- She's gone.

1218
01:29:00,136 --> 01:29:02,756
- Who? What's going on?
- Claire's disappeared.

1219
01:29:02,928 --> 01:29:05,796
I've looked.
They saw her leave this morning.

1220
01:29:06,136 --> 01:29:08,459
- Do you want me to come over?
- Please.

1221
01:29:11,344 --> 01:29:12,885
Has this happened before?

1222
01:29:13,052 --> 01:29:15,208
She never even appeared
at the windows.

1223
01:29:15,385 --> 01:29:16,927
Just behind the shutters.

1224
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,500
Did she have friends
she could go to?

1225
01:29:19,845 --> 01:29:24,133
She'd talk to people on her
computer under different names.

1226
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:28,048
- She can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

1227
01:29:28,384 --> 01:29:30,422
I've already been round three times.

1228
01:29:33,051 --> 01:29:34,842
- Hello?
- Mr. Oldman.

1229
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,795
- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- No.

1230
01:29:37,969 --> 01:29:40,670
- lf she calls, let me know.
- I will.

1231
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:44,623
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.

1232
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,673
Forgotten what?

1233
01:29:54,093 --> 01:29:57,505
- There he is. Here we go.
- Lot number one.

1234
01:29:57,842 --> 01:30:01,881
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

1235
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,171
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

1236
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:07,506
with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.

1237
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:11,256
Upper frame richly...

1238
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:22,256
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
with adornments,

1239
01:30:22,424 --> 01:30:24,166
floral motifs and festoons.

1240
01:30:24,342 --> 01:30:26,711
Upper frame richly
engraved with whirls.

1241
01:30:26,882 --> 01:30:28,340
Can we say 130,000 euros?

1242
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,042
140,000 euros.

1243
01:30:31,382 --> 01:30:33,705
150,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left.

1244
01:30:33,882 --> 01:30:35,920
160,000 euros. Lady up the back.

1245
01:30:36,299 --> 01:30:40,422
170,000 euros.
180,000 euros on the telephone.

1246
01:30:40,756 --> 01:30:44,336
200,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left in the room.

1247
01:30:44,506 --> 01:30:46,711
220,000 euros.

1248
01:30:46,881 --> 01:30:49,998
250,000 euros on the tele...

1249
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,373
Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking.

1250
01:30:53,549 --> 01:30:56,166
- Robert's looking further afield.
- Alright.

1251
01:30:56,339 --> 01:30:59,123
- I'll call you later.
- Alright

1252
01:31:01,505 --> 01:31:04,208
- He's gone crazy.
- 280,000.

1253
01:31:04,547 --> 01:31:06,668
310,000. Any more?

1254
01:31:07,547 --> 01:31:09,834
Sold!

1255
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:14,036
I'm doing the rounds
of the hospitals, but there's nothing.

1256
01:31:14,214 --> 01:31:15,410
Just keep looking.

1257
01:31:15,589 --> 01:31:18,206
- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.
- Thanks.

1258
01:31:19,255 --> 01:31:20,830
Lot number 2.

1259
01:31:21,005 --> 01:31:23,919
A 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

1260
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:25,913
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.

1261
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:28,755
The carved frame
surmounts an inlaid stripe,

1262
01:31:29,088 --> 01:31:32,370
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

1263
01:31:32,713 --> 01:31:34,702
surrounded by carvings of fruit.

1264
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:38,163
Three spiralled,
tapered columns flank the doors.

1265
01:31:38,502 --> 01:31:41,537
The lower body has two drawers.

1266
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:45,742
And um...

1267
01:31:50,295 --> 01:31:53,411
There's nothing for it
but to call the police.

1268
01:31:53,586 --> 01:31:56,454
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

1269
01:31:56,627 --> 01:31:58,086
Let's wait a bit longer.

1270
01:31:58,419 --> 01:31:59,996
What do you hope will happen?

1271
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:03,666
That she'll come back... or turn up.

1272
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:07,670
Or they'll find out where she is.

1273
01:32:07,837 --> 01:32:11,580
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.

1274
01:32:11,752 --> 01:32:13,825
Well, that depends.

1275
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:16,041
No matter how deeply rooted it is,

1276
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,994
sometimes a phobia
can just disappear by itself.

1277
01:32:19,336 --> 01:32:20,993
So, why did she run away?

1278
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,289
Maybe something happened
between you

1279
01:32:23,626 --> 01:32:26,197
that drove her
to take that kind of decision.

1280
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:29,659
You know perfectly well
that's impossible.

1281
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:32,667
You're the only person
who knows everything

1282
01:32:32,835 --> 01:32:34,540
that happened between us.

1283
01:32:38,084 --> 01:32:40,324
Excuse me a minute.

1284
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:02,790
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.

1285
01:33:02,959 --> 01:33:05,363
I've called
all the publishers in existence

1286
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:07,578
but none of them knows
who she is.

1287
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:09,988
They said that often
even they don't know

1288
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:13,330
the identity of authors
who use pseudonyms.

1289
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,822
I'd never have guessed that you

1290
01:33:15,999 --> 01:33:18,453
would have ended up
in a mess like this.

1291
01:33:18,624 --> 01:33:22,404
- I don't know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

1292
01:33:22,748 --> 01:33:24,904
Ah.

1293
01:33:25,082 --> 01:33:29,538
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

1294
01:33:29,873 --> 01:33:31,698
that she's just run away.

1295
01:33:32,998 --> 01:33:37,406
I'd say, I don't know,
she'd been abducted or something.

1296
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:40,663
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.

1297
01:33:40,998 --> 01:33:44,363
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

1298
01:33:44,539 --> 01:33:46,116
and carried her off by force.

1299
01:33:46,456 --> 01:33:49,869
- But who?
- I've had my doubts about Robert.

1300
01:33:50,206 --> 01:33:51,236
The young guy?

1301
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:54,579
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

1302
01:33:54,914 --> 01:33:58,078
From the literary point of view,
he fits the bill.

1303
01:33:59,206 --> 01:34:01,242
The young knight
rescuing the damsel

1304
01:34:01,414 --> 01:34:04,861
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.

1305
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,954
Literature, exactly.

1306
01:34:08,287 --> 01:34:10,278
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

1307
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:13,904
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.

1308
01:34:14,246 --> 01:34:16,735
I can't imagine what reasons.

1309
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:20,279
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

1310
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:22,740
that are incompatible with flight.

1311
01:34:23,078 --> 01:34:25,069
I wouldn't be so sure,
if I were you.

1312
01:34:25,412 --> 01:34:27,901
Human emotions
are like works of art.

1313
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:29,952
They can be forged.

1314
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:34,032
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

1315
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:40,524
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

1316
01:34:40,869 --> 01:34:43,820
Joy, pain, hate.

1317
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:47,824
Illness, recovery.

1318
01:34:49,369 --> 01:34:51,443
Even love.

1319
01:35:09,285 --> 01:35:11,027
- Hello?
- Listen.

1320
01:35:11,202 --> 01:35:13,738
There's something
that hadn't occurred to us.

1321
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:17,950
Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?

1322
01:35:18,118 --> 01:35:20,238
I don't remember
any other doors

1323
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:22,614
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.

1324
01:35:24,034 --> 01:35:26,275
Claire!

1325
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:31,156
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic... if you want?

1326
01:35:37,116 --> 01:35:39,950
Did you know
that Miss Claire was a writer?

1327
01:35:40,116 --> 01:35:42,688
I heard her parents
talk about it.

1328
01:35:42,866 --> 01:35:45,900
She used a pseudonym
for her books.

1329
01:35:46,076 --> 01:35:49,985
I never knew that.
I've never seen the books.

1330
01:35:50,325 --> 01:35:52,065
She never wanted them here.

1331
01:35:52,407 --> 01:35:53,781
Claire!

1332
01:35:55,075 --> 01:35:58,357
We're wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.

1333
01:35:58,533 --> 01:36:00,109
You've come back.

1334
01:36:00,283 --> 01:36:02,108
- We should...
- Quiet!

1335
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:03,777
You've...

1336
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:06,359
You've come back.

1337
01:36:06,532 --> 01:36:08,405
You've...

1338
01:36:10,448 --> 01:36:12,274
You've come back.

1339
01:36:12,614 --> 01:36:13,988
You've...

1340
01:36:14,157 --> 01:36:15,815
Claire?

1341
01:36:21,157 --> 01:36:24,854
Claire, I can feel you're there.
Answer me.

1342
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:28,815
You've come back.

1343
01:36:31,656 --> 01:36:34,736
- You've come back.
- Of course I have.

1344
01:36:36,073 --> 01:36:37,731
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

1345
01:36:49,696 --> 01:36:52,648
I thought
you'd abandoned me.

1346
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:56,318
- Like last time.
- Last time?

1347
01:36:56,655 --> 01:36:59,487
When we got back from Prague.

1348
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:03,981
Claire.

1349
01:37:25,903 --> 01:37:27,977
I will never abandon you.

1350
01:37:31,528 --> 01:37:35,058
I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.

1351
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:40,651
I was there with my first
and only boyfriend.

1352
01:37:42,819 --> 01:37:44,442
He was older than me.

1353
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:52,021
When we got back
from that excursion,

1354
01:37:52,194 --> 01:37:55,108
one afternoon,
we were walking in the city centre.

1355
01:37:57,945 --> 01:38:00,018
A car crashed into us.

1356
01:38:01,194 --> 01:38:04,938
When I came to,
he wasn't there anymore.

1357
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:30,816
I went back home
and I never went out again.

1358
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:01,347
I've never slept
with a woman.

1359
01:39:01,691 --> 01:39:04,688
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

1360
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:08,520
I spent the whole night
just looking at her.

1361
01:39:08,857 --> 01:39:13,099
- It was wonderful.
- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

1362
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:16,224
You've succeeded
in making her fall in love.

1363
01:39:17,939 --> 01:39:19,811
I had a good teacher.

1364
01:39:22,314 --> 01:39:24,470
I understood where the dwarf hid.

1365
01:39:24,815 --> 01:39:27,682
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

1366
01:39:28,023 --> 01:39:29,647
He would crouch in there

1367
01:39:29,815 --> 01:39:32,219
and his voice would reverberate
in the body.

1368
01:39:32,397 --> 01:39:34,187
It must have made an impression.

1369
01:39:34,521 --> 01:39:36,642
Do you think love can be faked?

1370
01:39:41,397 --> 01:39:44,229
In keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,

1371
01:39:44,565 --> 01:39:46,886
I'd say it can't be completely faked.

1372
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:49,267
If one could say love is a work of art.

1373
01:39:49,605 --> 01:39:52,093
It'd be amazing if it were,
wouldn't it?

1374
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:54,143
lt could be sold off at an auction.

1375
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,141
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories.

1376
01:39:58,313 --> 01:40:00,801
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story.

1377
01:40:01,146 --> 01:40:03,052
No problem. No problem.

1378
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:05,801
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...

1379
01:40:05,978 --> 01:40:08,433
It'll be good as new.
Just like the first day.

1380
01:40:08,771 --> 01:40:11,093
What do you think
you're going to do now?

1381
01:40:13,062 --> 01:40:15,385
I want to coax her out.

1382
01:40:15,728 --> 01:40:19,592
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard
if I were you.

1383
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:22,011
She's too fragile.

1384
01:40:22,353 --> 01:40:26,726
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will fall into place naturally.

1385
01:40:41,894 --> 01:40:45,803
No!

1386
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:38,260
Hello? Hello?

1387
01:41:38,433 --> 01:41:41,266
Virgil? Virgil, is that you?

1388
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,306
Virgil! Virgil!

1389
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:24,380
Virgil?

1390
01:42:45,012 --> 01:42:46,803
Help! Help!

1391
01:42:48,137 --> 01:42:50,672
- Hold it up!
- It is up!

1392
01:43:19,928 --> 01:43:22,677
Why don't you love it?

1393
01:43:22,844 --> 01:43:26,674
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.

1394
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:29,131
You come home a night,
sleep if you can.

1395
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:31,673
Next morning,
you're off somewhere else.

1396
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:35,084
Let's go back inside.

1397
01:43:36,468 --> 01:43:40,249
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

1398
01:43:40,427 --> 01:43:43,791
Yes, but the plan was never realised.

1399
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:46,635
Except for the inaugural reception.

1400
01:43:46,968 --> 01:43:48,924
I was so distrustful of other people

1401
01:43:49,093 --> 01:43:53,797
that I kept them away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.

1402
01:43:56,092 --> 01:43:57,963
I was a fool.

1403
01:43:59,426 --> 01:44:01,002
Even now, I still get upset

1404
01:44:01,176 --> 01:44:04,458
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

1405
01:44:04,634 --> 01:44:06,708
After dinner, I send them home.

1406
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,794
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

1407
01:44:10,966 --> 01:44:12,708
Yes, you were right.

1408
01:44:14,382 --> 01:44:16,457
And thanks to you, I understood.

1409
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:37,292
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

1410
01:44:39,508 --> 01:44:43,417
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.

1411
01:44:52,007 --> 01:44:54,755
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.

1412
01:44:54,924 --> 01:44:58,205
I never liked games
where you had to close your eyes.

1413
01:45:05,506 --> 01:45:09,036
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

1414
01:45:13,255 --> 01:45:14,499
We're almost there.

1415
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,539
Stop now.

1416
01:45:19,839 --> 01:45:21,545
Open your eyes.

1417
01:45:29,379 --> 01:45:31,085
I don't believe it.

1418
01:45:34,587 --> 01:45:36,080
It's overwhelming.

1419
01:45:36,712 --> 01:45:39,036
I've been collecting them
all my life.

1420
01:45:41,047 --> 01:45:44,126
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women

1421
01:45:44,461 --> 01:45:46,831
Yes.

1422
01:45:47,003 --> 01:45:49,575
I've loved them all
and they loved me back.

1423
01:45:49,921 --> 01:45:52,042
They taught me to wait for you.

1424
01:45:53,879 --> 01:45:55,704
And now that you're here,

1425
01:45:55,879 --> 01:45:58,082
we'd like you to come
and live with us

1426
01:45:58,253 --> 01:46:00,707
and make this beautiful hotel
your home.

1427
01:46:02,253 --> 01:46:03,793
Oh, Virgil.

1428
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:08,950
If anything should ever happen to us,

1429
01:46:09,128 --> 01:46:11,201
I want you to know that I do love you.

1430
01:46:13,419 --> 01:46:15,042
I love you too.

1431
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:18,873
The catalogue for the sale
of the paintings and furniture

1432
01:46:19,045 --> 01:46:20,536
of Ibbetson Villa is ready.

1433
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:24,158
Congratulations. It's a lovely volume.
About time!

1434
01:46:25,834 --> 01:46:28,868
I wonder who'll buy
this wonderful stuff... Oh, sorry.

1435
01:46:29,044 --> 01:46:32,373
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.

1436
01:46:43,209 --> 01:46:44,750
Well, don't you like it?

1437
01:46:47,459 --> 01:46:48,833
No, it's just that...

1438
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:53,619
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...

1439
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:58,905
...I've been thinking I... don't want
to sell anymore.

1440
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:03,662
I'd like to leave everything
the way it was.

1441
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,577
I understand.

1442
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:13,655
Are you sure?

1443
01:47:14,499 --> 01:47:17,034
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

1444
01:47:19,207 --> 01:47:22,573
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.

1445
01:47:25,623 --> 01:47:26,786
Alright, Virgil!

1446
01:47:31,499 --> 01:47:35,657
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

1447
01:47:35,832 --> 01:47:37,491
That's saying something.

1448
01:47:37,665 --> 01:47:39,702
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

1449
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:43,695
And since you've become
my family...

1450
01:47:45,581 --> 01:47:48,283
...I too have an important
announcement to make.

1451
01:47:49,124 --> 01:47:51,327
Next week,
I have an auction in London.

1452
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:55,029
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.

1453
01:48:00,747 --> 01:48:03,579
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

1454
01:48:03,747 --> 01:48:05,489
- Who? Virgil?
- Yes.

1455
01:48:05,665 --> 01:48:09,788
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.

1456
01:48:10,997 --> 01:48:13,615
How is it going
onstage for the last time?

1457
01:48:13,789 --> 01:48:17,651
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.

1458
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:20,117
All my colleagues
have come to see me off.

1459
01:48:20,288 --> 01:48:21,662
That's nice of them.

1460
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:25,658
This affection is because they won't
have to put up with me anymore.

1461
01:48:27,996 --> 01:48:31,243
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

1462
01:48:31,412 --> 01:48:32,870
Me too.

1463
01:48:33,037 --> 01:48:36,486
But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.

1464
01:48:36,663 --> 01:48:40,193
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.

1465
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:42,526
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

1466
01:48:43,412 --> 01:48:45,616
Have you heard
from our young friends?

1467
01:48:45,788 --> 01:48:48,571
Constantly.
I'm never left on my own.

1468
01:48:48,744 --> 01:48:50,783
Good. Give them my love.

1469
01:48:51,953 --> 01:48:54,619
- I can hear you've got to go.
- Yes.

1470
01:48:55,702 --> 01:48:59,234
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- Good luck, my darling.

1471
01:49:00,203 --> 01:49:02,656
£12,100,000.

1472
01:49:05,828 --> 01:49:07,237
Any more?

1473
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:11,523
£12,300,000.

1474
01:49:12,827 --> 01:49:14,368
Any advance?

1475
01:49:17,369 --> 01:49:19,858
£12,500,000 on the telephone.

1476
01:49:21,369 --> 01:49:23,360
Any more?

1477
01:49:23,535 --> 01:49:26,152
All done at £12,500,000.

1478
01:49:26,493 --> 01:49:29,989
Sold for £12,500,000.

1479
01:49:31,326 --> 01:49:34,692
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

1480
01:49:47,034 --> 01:49:50,364
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

1481
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,856
Can I say hello to you in public?

1482
01:49:53,033 --> 01:49:55,023
Oh, Billy.

1483
01:49:55,366 --> 01:49:59,491
You were fantastic, my friend! I'm
happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

1484
01:49:59,825 --> 01:50:02,029
You say it like
we'll never meet again.

1485
01:50:02,449 --> 01:50:03,942
Of course we will.

1486
01:50:04,116 --> 01:50:07,646
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

1487
01:50:08,366 --> 01:50:10,273
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

1488
01:50:11,408 --> 01:50:14,192
To remind you of
what a great artist I could've been

1489
01:50:14,533 --> 01:50:18,396
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.

1490
01:50:18,574 --> 01:50:20,364
I promise I won't burn it.

1491
01:50:30,657 --> 01:50:32,197
Claire.

1492
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:35,281
Claire, I'm back!

1493
01:50:37,281 --> 01:50:38,822
Hello?

1494
01:50:42,031 --> 01:50:44,898
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- No, sir.

1495
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:46,822
Claire?

1496
01:50:48,448 --> 01:50:49,858
Where are you?

1497
01:50:51,615 --> 01:50:52,776
Claire?

1498
01:50:53,989 --> 01:50:56,773
Mr. Oldman,
she must have gone out.

1499
01:50:57,114 --> 01:50:58,570
It was the same yesterday.

1500
01:50:58,738 --> 01:51:02,068
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
then came back for lunch.

1501
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:03,482
Alright.

1502
01:52:26,942 --> 01:52:28,851
"There is always

1503
01:52:29,027 --> 01:52:32,059
something authentic
concealed in every forgery."

1504
01:52:32,234 --> 01:52:35,646
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1505
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:38,022
"There is always something
authentic

1506
01:52:38,191 --> 01:52:39,981
concealed in every forgery."

1507
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:42,023
I couldn't agree more.

1508
01:52:42,192 --> 01:52:44,811
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1509
01:52:44,983 --> 01:52:47,188
"There is always something
authentic

1510
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:49,100
concealed in every forgery."

1511
01:52:49,276 --> 01:52:51,147
I couldn't agree more.

1512
01:52:51,315 --> 01:52:53,935
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1513
01:52:54,107 --> 01:52:56,229
"There is always something
authentic

1514
01:52:56,399 --> 01:52:58,106
concealed in every forgery."

1515
01:52:58,441 --> 01:53:02,436
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1516
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:04,764
"There is always something
authentic

1517
01:53:04,942 --> 01:53:06,647
concealed in every forgery."

1518
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,853
I couldn't agree more.

1519
01:53:09,023 --> 01:53:11,060
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1520
01:53:11,232 --> 01:53:14,680
"There is always something
authentic concealed in every..."

1521
01:53:31,189 --> 01:53:35,183
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

1522
01:53:35,355 --> 01:53:38,473
Isn't this nice?
Look who's come to see you!

1523
01:53:46,022 --> 01:53:48,179
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

1524
01:53:52,813 --> 01:53:54,554
I've brought your mail,

1525
01:53:54,897 --> 01:53:58,179
some newspapers
and a few magazines.

1526
01:55:25,059 --> 01:55:28,922
A few days ago, they brought
some furniture to the villa opposite.

1527
01:55:32,476 --> 01:55:33,637
Did you notice?

1528
01:55:34,433 --> 01:55:37,300
I think so,
but I don't see much from in here.

1529
01:55:38,016 --> 01:55:39,046
Ask her.

1530
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,509
Claire?

1531
01:55:48,682 --> 01:55:51,137
Listen to what
this gentleman wants to say.

1532
01:55:52,267 --> 01:55:53,296
Yes.

1533
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:56,092
And the day after,

1534
01:55:56,266 --> 01:55:59,513
other workmen came
and took everything away again.

1535
01:56:01,641 --> 01:56:03,181
The day after?

1536
01:56:04,473 --> 01:56:08,419
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.

1537
01:56:11,391 --> 01:56:13,676
I was here a while ago.

1538
01:56:14,973 --> 01:56:17,177
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

1539
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:23,586
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

1540
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,097
Today makes 10.

1541
01:56:27,431 --> 01:56:31,045
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

1542
01:56:32,304 --> 01:56:35,505
Medium height, light hair,
a bit pale?

1543
01:56:36,805 --> 01:56:40,669
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

1544
01:56:42,265 --> 01:56:43,721
Are you sure?

1545
01:56:44,055 --> 01:56:45,714
Then another six.

1546
01:56:46,556 --> 01:56:51,507
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.

1547
01:56:51,887 --> 01:56:53,297
What did I say?

1548
01:56:53,471 --> 01:56:55,925
She's a phenomenon,
remembers everything.

1549
01:56:57,971 --> 01:56:59,512
It's not possible.

1550
01:57:02,053 --> 01:57:04,174
You were at the villa 63 times.

1551
01:57:04,513 --> 01:57:08,422
36 during the day and 27 at night,

1552
01:57:08,762 --> 01:57:11,085
excluding the night
of the accident.

1553
01:57:12,553 --> 01:57:15,966
- One, four, four.
- One, four, four?

1554
01:57:16,303 --> 01:57:18,543
The telephone number
for the ambulance.

1555
01:57:20,012 --> 01:57:21,588
The villa is free now.

1556
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:24,886
If you're interested,
I'll get you a good deal.

1557
01:57:26,512 --> 01:57:29,129
- Who owns it?
- Me.

1558
01:57:30,344 --> 01:57:32,418
But I don't know what to do with it.

1559
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:36,177
I often rent it out to cinema people.

1560
01:57:37,094 --> 01:57:38,468
Cinema people?

1561
01:57:39,053 --> 01:57:42,003
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer

1562
01:57:42,178 --> 01:57:44,713
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.

1563
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:47,216
He's really nice, that boy.

1564
01:57:48,135 --> 01:57:49,793
He can do anything.

1565
01:57:49,968 --> 01:57:52,458
There's nothing he can't fix.

1566
01:57:53,051 --> 01:57:56,383
And he's always kissing me.

1567
01:57:56,551 --> 01:57:58,342
Bringing me flowers.

1568
02:00:43,668 --> 02:00:47,449
The Paris Express
is now arriving at platform seven.

1569
02:00:48,918 --> 02:00:50,624
Your attention, please.

1570
02:00:50,792 --> 02:00:53,625
The Berlin-Prague Arrow
is running 40 minutes late

1571
02:00:53,792 --> 02:00:54,989
due to fog on the line.

1572
02:00:56,835 --> 02:00:58,375
Come in, sir.

1573
02:00:59,709 --> 02:01:02,079
We furnished it
exactly as you requested.

1574
02:01:03,501 --> 02:01:05,989
And tomorrow, your trunks
will be delivered.

1575
02:01:06,167 --> 02:01:09,283
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.

1576
02:01:09,626 --> 02:01:12,991
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

1577
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:20,999
Oh, Virgil.

1578
02:01:22,417 --> 02:01:26,623
If anything should happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.

1579
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:52,483
Are you on your own, sir?

1580
02:04:03,117 --> 02:04:05,820
No. I'm waiting for someone.

1581
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:32,000
