1
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:20,481
Hey, Don. It's Daniel.

2
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,640
Listen. Don't put the boiler in
until I get back.

3
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,798
The framing inspection
isn't before a couple of weeks,

4
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,332
So we got plenty of time.

5
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,634
I'll check in with you guys
in a couple of days, ok?

6
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:33,429
Take care. Bye.

7
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,691
First thing I will do is try
to find another producer.

8
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,993
There's gotta to be somebody else
in town who could help us out.

9
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,444
Just for the pre-game.

10
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,035
Hold on just a second, Cal.

11
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:56,830
Hey, just one second.

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,898
I gotta go.

13
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,201
Call me back if you need me. Good luck!

14
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:03,830
Ok, bye.

15
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,461
Hey, I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,611
What's up?

17
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:09,297
I got stuck in the phone with Cal.

18
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:13,325
The crew hasn't even made it to the arena yet.

19
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:18,121
That's not good.

20
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,916
I don't know what they gonna do.

21
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:25,553
Are all the lights out?

22
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,191
No. They're all on.

23
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:31,738
Just checking.

24
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,945
Are you sure you want
to load that thing with you?

25
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,383
I don't even think we can get online there.

26
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:40,179
Oh, we can. I checked.

27
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,754
All set?

28
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:52,550
Let's just try to remember...

29
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:54,276
It's Cal.

30
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:58,016
Hey, just a second.

31
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,031
This is supposed to be a vacation.

32
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:03,387
I know. And boy, do we need one.

33
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:06,839
Hey, what's up?

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,635
Well, that could work.

35
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,236
Hey.

36
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:48,742
We're all set for the morning.
We have to be at the dock at 8:30.

37
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:54,348
Did you have a little shower?

38
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,362
Yes.

39
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,375
Great.

40
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:01,924
I'm so glad I made you bring this.

41
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:05,856
There's gotta be thundershowers
tomorrow night late.

42
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,391
Looks like it's gonna be crowded
in the boat tomorrow.

43
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,404
I hope it's not a cattle boat.

44
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:12,186
We'll just do our own thing. Did you ask?

45
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,776
No. They seem pretty relaxed.

46
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,597
Why is it so hot here?

47
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,708
Air conditioner is blasted.

48
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,625
Figures.

49
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:23,007
- We didn't come for the room.
- That's for sure.

50
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,574
Considering how much time we had
to put this whole thing together,

51
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,627
I'm amazed if we got anything.

52
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,353
I'm not complaining.

53
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:32,709
Yes, you are.

54
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,860
Alright, I'm done.

55
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,011
Want to check your email?

56
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:39,807
No. I'm on vacation, remember?

57
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:46,424
Right.

58
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:45,249
That tasted good.

59
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:07,211
His face!

60
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,265
You too.

61
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,376
Yeah. It's different. I'm a girl.

62
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:13,228
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

63
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:19,487
So how are you?

64
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:22,555
Fine.

65
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:26,392
A little stressed. Still I guess.

66
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,539
It's about work?

67
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:31,771
Yeah, work, life.

68
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:36,187
Maybe I can get you
to think of something else.

69
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,860
You ok?

70
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,934
I might not be in the mood.

71
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:59,958
Just thought like
you might be a second ago.

72
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,890
Could go either way, I guess.

73
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,686
Maybe I need to give you a little nudge.

74
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,522
Yeah, I'm not in the mood.

75
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:23,263
That wasn't the direction
I was trying to nudge you in.

76
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:28,058
Sorry. I'm just tired.

77
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,276
It's been a long day.

78
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:37,360
We can talk.

79
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,086
Nah, you are right.

80
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,101
We should get some sleep.

81
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,458
I'm wiped.

82
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,815
Very funny.

83
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:57,092
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

84
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:00,833
Welcome aboard the
world famous "Reef Explorer".

85
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,175
My name's Davis.

86
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,861
I'm going to be one of the guides
on board our vessel today.

87
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:08,025
Also driving your boat
with, huh, Linda

88
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,047
and Junior. Junior is gonna be
the next guide on board our vessel.

89
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:14,068
We are going to be knocked
to a dive site called "Magic Kingdom".

90
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,941
Now things you want to look for
down there on this dive:

91
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,001
spotted eels, spotted morays,

92
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:22,081
enough of stingrays in the sand,
there's angelfish, parrot fish,

93
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,732
tropical fish, barbed beauties...

94
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,974
Is there any big fish
like sharks or anything?

95
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,508
Yeah. We're going out
to the open ocean,

96
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,626
so chances are you probably
might see a shark or three.

97
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,742
But, you know, like I tell
everybody who see a shark,

98
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,852
if you don't want to see it, close your eyes.

99
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,865
No problem.

100
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,600
Sharks over here are not
very aggressive towards human beings,

101
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:45,333
so therefore you don't really
have to worry about sharks.

102
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,825
Ok.

103
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:52,622
Ok, that's enough guys.
Enjoy the ride out.

104
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,163
Ok, guys. I need to have
your attention for just a few minutes.

105
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,002
We are going to be entering
the water in a minute.

106
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:11,625
Once that everybody has entered their gear,
what we want you to do is

107
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,756
a buddy system to enter the water first.

108
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:16,709
Once that buddy systems are in the water,
we are going to have guided divers,

109
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,199
and myself, Linda, and Junior,
is gonna help you guys get into water.

110
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,180
Linda is on surface support, so
if you surface in a distance away from the boat,

111
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:25,230
You want to let her know that you are OK.

112
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,714
You start to let her know you are OK
by giving her a big "O" over your head.

113
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,547
If you are not Ok, you do
the international distress signal.

114
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,129
The international
distress signal is simple,

115
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,527
very easy to do. It's like this:

116
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,540
"Help!"

117
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,033
Ok? All right?

118
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,010
Very easy, very simple.

119
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,965
Once everybody's in the water,

120
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,412
I want you to make your way
to the white float ball.

121
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:48,857
The white float ball
is at the stern of the boat.

122
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:51,332
- We want you to huh...
- May I sit there?

123
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:54,750
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

124
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,507
Is that your mask?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

125
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,461
- You didn't bring your mask?
- I brought it. I don't know what happened.

126
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,817
It was supposed to be here.

127
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,216
Sorry, sorry everybody.
I'm just, you know...

128
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:09,544
Anxious to dive. I don't wanna...
Do you have extra masks on the...

129
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:12,475
- Linda, did you bring an extra mask?
- You have an extra mask, Linda?

130
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,080
No, I don't have an extra mask.

131
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,637
- Junior?
- Anyone?

132
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:17,292
Does anyone have an extra mask?

133
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,426
No.

134
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,738
You can't dive without a mask.

135
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,136
Yeah, I understand that.

136
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,533
Thank you, Travis.

137
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,410
Davis, Davis.
I'm sorry guys. Go on.

138
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:31,252
Alright guys. The dive is going to be
at a maximum drop of 60 feet, so...

139
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:35,858
Therefore, we are going to be
down there for about 35 minutes.

140
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,500
You are ready?

141
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,008
Yeah.

142
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,302
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

143
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,702
I can't equalize my ears.

144
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,525
Ok. Are you going
to report to the guardian,

145
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,018
trying to get equalized?

146
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,745
I don't think I can go down.

147
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:46,433
Alright, do me a favor.
Inflate your BC,

148
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,054
put the regulator in your mouth

149
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:49,828
and swim back towards the platform.

150
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,602
Ok.

151
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,466
Up, stand up, stretch your knees up.

152
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,873
- How was it down there?
- I didn't get down.

153
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,202
You didn't. Why not?
What happened?

154
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:25,313
I can't get my ears equalized.

155
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:26,991
You feel all right?

156
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,285
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

157
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:32,121
You mind if I borrow this? Is it ok?

158
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll bring it right back.
Save some time. Yeah?

159
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,781
- Sure.
- Thank you. God bless you. I Love you.

160
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,560
Are you going down now?

161
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,189
Yeah, Linda, I'm going down.

162
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,516
Hallelujah.

163
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,587
The only problem I have is

164
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,931
you don't have a buddy right now.

165
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,275
I don't need a buddy.
I've dived all my life.

166
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,867
Unfortunately you do
if you're on our boat, sir.

167
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,690
Your boat.

168
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,107
Give me a break.
Find a buddy for me.

169
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,564
Someone down there's
coming back up.

170
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:55,905
Can you dive with me?

171
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:59,896
Unfortunately, if I don't find you
a buddy, I can't let you go, sir.

172
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:03,389
I love high water.
I'm diving in the finest. Help me.

173
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,736
Come on, dive.

174
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:09,213
- What's your name?
- Brian.

175
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,731
Are you ready to go, Brian?
We're set. See? I got a buddy.

176
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:21,745
All set.

177
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,696
- Sir, your regulator.
- Regulator.

178
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:26,465
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, got one of those.

179
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,884
Have a good time.

180
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,540
Thank you.

181
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,104
There's a place
in Heaven for you.

182
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,566
I love you. Thank you.

183
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:21,275
It was great, man.

184
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:00,233
- Yeah, I'm good. You good?
- Yeah.

185
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,770
Thanks buddy. I appreciated.

186
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:05,987
Thanks a lot.

187
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:08,275
You are an angel. I needed that.

188
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:15,699
- Did you see that shark down there?
- Yeah.

189
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:05,633
Did everybody enjoy their dive?

190
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,222
Yeah.

191
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:08,631
That's good.

192
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:26,201
Have we got everybody?

193
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:01,588
Daniel, where is the boat?

194
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,384
It's a good question.

195
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:07,246
I guess it's one of those.

196
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,500
You gotta be kidding me.

197
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:11,394
It better be one of those.

198
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:13,288
But which one do you think?

199
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,484
I don't know.

200
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:21,705
- Did you get us lost?
- No.

201
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,070
So we are in the right spot?

202
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,628
Yes. I'm 90% sure.

203
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,152
90%? Why only 90%?

204
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:30,439
'cause the boat is not here.

205
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,579
There is a coral head
exactly 42 feet below us.

206
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:36,774
I marked it on the way down.

207
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,155
Yeah. I can still see the stocks.

208
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:43,479
The stocks?

209
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,658
Yeah, there's three prawn,
like a forked thing

210
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,556
right below us.

211
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,164
You are unbelievable.

212
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,078
You can still find some of
those little coral formation

213
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,481
in the middle of the ocean, but

214
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:58,075
you get lost going to my mother's.

215
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,969
I need an incentive.

216
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,506
You love my mother.

217
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:07,176
They obviously cannot see us.

218
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:11,695
You think it's time to swim?

219
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,948
Swim where?

220
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:18,437
I don't know. I think...

221
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:19,941
That one is the closest.

222
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:21,476
Honey, it's a bad idea.

223
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:22,530
Why?

224
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:25,024
Because we are not sure
that's our boat.

225
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,654
And if it's not our boat,

226
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:30,107
That means we could swim
farther from our boat.

227
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,978
Besides, you know how far away that is?

228
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,573
It's really far.

229
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:36,532
It's farther than that.

230
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:39,607
And if it's not our boat,
they can pull away at anytime.

231
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:42,380
And our fucking boat,
wherever the hell it is,

232
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:44,929
will have a hell of time
trying to find us.

233
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:03,386
You're going somewhere?

234
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:05,439
Just my face.

235
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:42,514
I hate to tell you this, but,

236
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:45,943
I didn't see anything that looks like
any kind of coral formation.

237
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:49,589
Could you just show me?
I'd just feel better. Sure?

238
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:08,164
See it? Cause I don't see anything.

239
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,623
- Shit!
- What?

240
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,533
You don't see it, because it's not there.

241
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:13,299
So does that mean...

242
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,937
...that since we've surfaced,
we're drifting.

243
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,433
Oh, shit. But what does
that mean? Should we swim?

244
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,452
Goddam it. We wasted all this time.

245
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,569
Honey I hate to tell you this,
but swim or not,

246
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,359
we're going
where this current decides.

247
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,011
Are they moving?

248
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:35,550
Hey! Yes.

249
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,754
Oh God.

250
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,367
Please let this be them.

251
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:40,820
- It's gotta be, right?
- Yes.

252
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:43,145
- They're coming right this way.
- Yep.

253
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:47,155
You realize that's a distress signal.

254
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:49,438
We are in distress.

255
00:29:47,312 --> 00:29:49,012
Daniel, did you just pee?

256
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:49,912
Yep.

257
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:51,601
You're so disgusting.

258
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,044
You said you are a little cold.

259
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,249
Daniel, was that a shark?

260
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:19,025
Maybe, or a dolphin.

261
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,563
If it was a dolphin, you'd be on your way
over there to play with it,

262
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,932
so you obviously think it was a shark.

263
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,766
- That's all we need right now.
- That's ok.

264
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:33,298
You were patting a shark
less than an hour ago.

265
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,536
Please, that was nothing
but a big old catfish.

266
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:42,010
It was more than two hours ago.

267
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:50,922
You know, now I'm starting
to really get cold.

268
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,293
It's ok.

269
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,204
Oh, Jesus Christ!

270
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,371
I thought he said they
never come that close.

271
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:06,264
They also said the boat would be here.

272
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,702
It's gone.

273
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:39,055
It was probably just curious.

274
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:42,179
A couple of bodies floating up
in the middle of nowhere,

275
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,846
I'm sure it's not
something it sees everyday.

276
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:48,347
Oh, Daniel.
Where the hell are they?

277
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:53,004
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

278
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:56,647
It makes me feel better.

279
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,866
But what do we do if it comes back?

280
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:00,085
I don't know.

281
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,359
Do we splash? Do we stay still?

282
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,798
You are the one who watches "Shark Week".

283
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:04,237
First of all, we should be in a cage.

284
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,795
No, we should be on land.

285
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:15,117
- Sharks are attracted to wounded fish.
- Ok.

286
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,814
So I guess you just
not splash around too much.

287
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:20,037
- Just sort of...
- Stay still?

288
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,979
Try to stay still.

289
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,204
Oh, God.

290
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:28,380
Ok. I can't stand
not knowing if it's under me.

291
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:33,293
- I'm just gonna look, ok?
- Ok.

292
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:39,202
Okay.

293
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:46,693
Katharine Hepburn
and Nick Nolte in "Grace Quigley"

294
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:55,060
and Nick Nolte and
John Malkovich in "Mulholland Falls".

295
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,228
How's that for a quick.

296
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:01,434
Always quick.

297
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:04,101
All right. It's your turn.

298
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,685
I, hum...

299
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,717
You know, I really
don't feel like playing.

300
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:15,851
Okay.

301
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:23,873
Feel hungry?

302
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:26,018
Of course.

303
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,083
I'm starving.

304
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,858
- Ouch! Shit!
- What?

305
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:32,313
Something just bit me here...

306
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:33,984
What? Where?

307
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,188
I don't know.
It's right down by my ankle.

308
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:39,572
Oh, God. It kills.

309
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,858
Goddam it! It burns!

310
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,965
I don't see anything.

311
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:50,913
- Did it get you?
- Yes!

312
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:51,871
- What is it?
- I don't know,

313
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,843
but the fucker really
stung me. It hurts.

314
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,207
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Okay.

315
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:48,129
- I think we are away from them.
- Is that far enough?

316
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:49,674
Anything?
You got anything?

317
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,968
No.

318
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,941
Damn, those fuckers stung.

319
00:35:55,942 --> 00:35:57,898
I know.

320
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,024
Where did it get you?

321
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,414
On my ankle, on my leg.

322
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:03,918
Through your wet suit?

323
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,802
I don't know. I guess so.

324
00:36:08,218 --> 00:36:09,728
So are you ok?

325
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,244
No. I'm not ok.

326
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:15,743
Are you ok?
We find our boat, we'll be ok.

327
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,551
Oh, come on, honey.

328
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,847
I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

329
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:22,122
It really sucks,

330
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:23,753
but we're going
to get through this, ok?

331
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,116
Ok.

332
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,713
I know I know.

333
00:36:32,061 --> 00:36:33,517
God, okay.

334
00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:39,865
I've just never heard of anything
so fucked up in my entire life.

335
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:42,742
Who's ever heard of
two people getting

336
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,619
left in the middle of the ocean before?

337
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,904
I have actually.

338
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:50,171
- You have?
- Yeah.

339
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:51,541
Where?

340
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,937
Dive magazines.

341
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,619
It's a lot more common than you think.

342
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,350
Well, thanks for telling me
when we got certified.

343
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,395
Over there.

344
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:23,478
Oh, my God. Oh, Daniel.

345
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,950
Oh, God. Please, please,
please, let just be them.

346
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,680
Oh, God. I don't even care
if it's not them.

347
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:31,331
Just please see us and pick us up.

348
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,965
I don't think they can see us.

349
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,570
Wish we had more sun.

350
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,169
- They can't see us.
- I know.

351
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:26,194
They are leaving.

352
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,553
Yeah.

353
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,365
Stay close.

354
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,669
What if they don't know we're missing?

355
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:20,627
There's no way.

356
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:24,203
They took a head count
on the boat. I saw it.

357
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,649
Our stuff is on board.
We have their tanks.

358
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,487
And we know we've drifted.

359
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:32,605
It may take them a while,
but they will find us.

360
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:41,411
I hate to tell you, but
I think my dramamine is running off.

361
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,104
- You're getting nauseous?
- Yeah.

362
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:47,770
- Honey, I could kill those fuckers.
- I know.

363
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:52,728
It's just all this going
up and down of the weights, I think.

364
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,755
You're probably getting dehydrated.

365
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:59,441
Yeah? But we can't drink the water, right?

366
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,702
No. I should've told you that before.

367
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:04,524
You didn't, did you?

368
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:05,627
A little.

369
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:06,729
Honey, stop.

370
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:09,895
It will give you diarrhea, and
make you even more dehydrated.

371
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:12,914
Great. "Shark Week"?

372
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,908
"Disasters At Sea", History Channel.

373
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,622
I guess this means
I have to stop complaining

374
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:21,594
about you watching
so much television.

375
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:25,194
But I didn't know
I might get something out of this.

376
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,665
I'm really, really not feeling well.

377
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,198
Oh, man.

378
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,213
You think maybe
if I took my weights out.

379
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:39,001
then it wouldn't
pull on me so much?

380
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:41,978
Just keep the belt, drop the weights.

381
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,121
You'll see'em try
to charge us for those.

382
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:10,662
Oh, hey. We should put our gloves on.

383
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,116
How are your stings?

384
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:17,183
Still there.

385
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:21,025
They're the one thing I think
the salt water is actually helping.

386
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,916
This glove isn't helping them.

387
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:34,577
I don't feel very good.

388
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,016
Why don't you
lay back for a little bit?

389
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:37,795
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Just lay back.

390
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:40,885
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok. I got you.

391
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,197
- Just relax.
- Ok.

392
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:45,904
- There you go.
- Ok.

393
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:47,717
Just for a few minutes.

394
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,867
Just relax.

395
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:53,663
Close your eyes.

396
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:03,084
Daniel, I have to pee.

397
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:05,718
Ok.

398
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:08,528
It's gonna be warm for a minute.

399
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:10,253
Thanks.

400
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:05,058
Daniel!

401
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:14,642
Oh, God. Daniel!

402
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:55,480
Daniel!

403
00:43:59,872 --> 00:44:01,369
Susanne!

404
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,973
Daniel, I'm over here.

405
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:08,042
Susanne!

406
00:44:28,644 --> 00:44:30,179
Oh, thank God.

407
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,793
It's ok. I got you.

408
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,114
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- I don't know.

409
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,037
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. You ok?

410
00:44:43,101 --> 00:44:44,215
What happened?
Where did you go?

411
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:46,370
I must have fallen asleep
and we drifted apart.

412
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:47,679
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

413
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,167
You scared the hell out of me.

414
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:50,892
I'm so sorry.

415
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:53,291
It's ok. I'm glad you are here.

416
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,442
Oh, my God.

417
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:55,592
It's ok.

418
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,086
How long are we sleeping?

419
00:44:58,087 --> 00:45:00,579
God, I'm so out of it.

420
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:06,099
Jesus, we've been
in the water for 7 hours.

421
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:10,841
Daniel, I feel something on my leg.

422
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:11,991
What?

423
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,047
I don't know. It hurts.

424
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:14,869
It's your sting?

425
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,691
The wrong leg.

426
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:18,801
Oh, my God. it really hurts.

427
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:21,391
We just try to keep...

428
00:45:23,308 --> 00:45:23,979
I don't see anything.

429
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,610
I can't either. It's on the back.

430
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:29,130
I just can't tell.
Hurt all over the whole thing.

431
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,694
Just leave it alone. Ok? Don't tap it.

432
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,419
I'm not touching it.

433
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,653
Well, something is touching it.

434
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:35,725
It's not me, honey. I'm not here.
My hands are all here.

435
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,323
- Something is tapping on it.
- I will take a look.

436
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:39,557
Jesus.

437
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:43,388
Oh, God. I feel sick.

438
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:31,962
I'm sorry, honey. I threw up.

439
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,706
Fish gotta eat too.

440
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:39,691
Speaking of which,
the thing patting at your leg,

441
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:40,895
is just a little cleaner fish.

442
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:42,803
What about my leg?

443
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,922
A little cut.

444
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:47,599
- How could it get cut?
- I don't know.

445
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,910
Maybe you rub it against my knife
over sleeping, or something.

446
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:52,404
Oh, come on. It wasn't a shark, was it?

447
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:54,609
- No, honey.
- Are you sure?

448
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:56,623
No. If it was a shark,
your leg would be gone.

449
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:57,654
Great.

450
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,651
And most, it was a teeny little barracuda

451
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,549
just checking to see if you tasted good.

452
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,296
Oh, God. Is it deep?

453
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:06,138
No, it's not deep.

454
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:08,271
- Let's swim out this puke.
- Ok.

455
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:09,725
Come on.

456
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,777
That's far enough, you think?

457
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:21,941
Yeah.

458
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,189
Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

459
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,161
I'm sorry.

460
00:47:26,162 --> 00:47:28,272
Rinse your mouth a little bit.

461
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:29,230
Yeah.

462
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:30,190
Just don't swallow any, ok?

463
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:34,985
Spit it back out.

464
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,338
Can still feel that tapping.

465
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,775
- What, the fish?
- Yeah.

466
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:43,521
Try not to focus on this. Relax.

467
00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:45,795
Here you go.

468
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:54,070
What is it? Are you ok?

469
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,652
It's leg cramp.

470
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:57,355
Can I help you?

471
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:58,866
Is there anything I can do?

472
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,782
I got it. Ouch!

473
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:02,866
We are really
falling apart, aren't we?

474
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:11,956
Oh, God. Oh, Honey. Oh, God.

475
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:14,784
They're gone. They're gone.

476
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:17,471
Jesus, Daniel. What kind are they?

477
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:18,716
The big ones.

478
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:20,635
I'm serious. Are they the bad kind?

479
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:22,138
I have no idea.

480
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:24,497
Oh, my God.

481
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:41,588
No, no, no. Be still.

482
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,614
Don't splash around.

483
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:46,785
Oh, my God. This can't be normal.

484
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:57,091
Honey, oh, honey.

485
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,416
I don't know what is worse,

486
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,423
seeing them or not seeing them.

487
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:07,153
Seeing them.

488
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,760
Unbelievable.

489
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:27,062
This is truly un-fucking believable.

490
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:31,570
The best part is that we paid to do this.

491
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:32,694
We paid to be out here.

492
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:35,860
We paid those incompetent fuckers
to drop us out

493
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:38,866
in the middle of the fucking ocean.

494
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:45,071
We wanted an ocean view.
Boy, did we get it?

495
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,184
You feel better?

496
00:51:02,234 --> 00:51:04,750
I wouldn't exactly call it better.

497
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,370
You finished yelling?

498
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:11,207
That could be.

499
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:16,040
Oh, good. You're not the only one
stuck out here, you know.

500
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,503
What? Are you mad at me?

501
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,148
No.

502
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:23,908
Why? Because I was yelling?

503
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:25,418
No.

504
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,584
Fine. You be mad.

505
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:35,690
It's a great vacation, honey, isn't it?

506
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,869
So now we entered no talking phase, uh?

507
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:53,486
Could you maybe
answer one last question?

508
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:59,265
Has this somehow over the hours
become my fault?

509
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,481
Let's just drop it.

510
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,638
Of course.

511
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:21,051
You believe what you want to believe.

512
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:24,375
But I know for certain that
we were in the right spot.

513
00:52:25,286 --> 00:52:27,684
It's not just a matter
of being in the right spot.

514
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:29,985
It's being there on time.

515
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:33,726
We were on time.
We were early. He said 10:30.

516
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,124
Do we always have to get it so close?

517
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,137
For God's sake,

518
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:39,671
Why don't we stay with the group?

519
00:52:39,672 --> 00:52:42,981
We always have to do things
different than everybody else.

520
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:46,289
We shouldn't have spent so much time
with that god damn eel.

521
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,590
Well, that's a nice touch, adding "we".

522
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:52,236
Especially since you wanted have
nothing to do with that fucking eel.

523
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,440
Do you honestly, seriously, honey,

524
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:57,318
Do you honestly think
that we got left behind

525
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,629
because we were late?

526
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:01,710
I'm serious.

527
00:53:01,826 --> 00:53:03,552
Do you have any idea
how idiotic that sounds?

528
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:05,775
Oh, so now I'm an idiot.

529
00:53:06,046 --> 00:53:07,388
We are where we are, aren't we?

530
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:11,111
Yes, fine, because of me.

531
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:14,005
You refused to swim.

532
00:53:15,296 --> 00:53:17,766
My God. There were boats all around us.

533
00:53:17,939 --> 00:53:21,957
You refused, and now, look, look around us.

534
00:53:22,149 --> 00:53:24,459
We are stuck in the middle of the ocean.

535
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,203
With nobody.

536
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:29,258
Even if we had been swimming
for the last five hours,

537
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,594
We would not be any closer
to a boat than we are now.

538
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,351
The only reason we are even
out here in the first place,

539
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:38,557
is because of your fucking job.

540
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,711
- What?
- If it were not for your job,

541
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:42,969
We would not have thrown out
our plan out of the window,

542
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,887
Rush around the last minute, and

543
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,805
Settled on this fucking trip.

544
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:47,955
We would be at home,

545
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:50,352
in the middle of our hectic lives,

546
00:53:50,592 --> 00:53:53,786
which right now sounds like heaven to me.

547
00:53:54,382 --> 00:53:55,915
And in a month's time,

548
00:53:55,916 --> 00:54:00,039
as we planned seven, seven months ago,

549
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,013
we would be where we were
supposed to be in the first place,

550
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:06,820
and paying less than
we are now to be shark bait.

551
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,717
Oh, damn it.

552
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,788
I can't even believe you
bring all that up right now.

553
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:19,507
You were the one that picked the dates.

554
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:23,680
Yeah, out of my whopping two choices,
this was the better date.

555
00:54:26,509 --> 00:54:28,493
I wanted to go skiing.

556
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,433
Oh, God.

557
00:56:58,037 --> 00:57:00,717
I can't believe how far we've drifted.

558
00:57:01,106 --> 00:57:02,929
You think the current
will take us over there?

559
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,763
Hopefully.

560
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,118
How's your leg?

561
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:09,723
It's ok.

562
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,207
You know, hurts a little bit, but it...

563
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,054
it's ok.

564
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:16,851
All right, let's go for it.

565
00:58:15,144 --> 00:58:19,436
- I love you.
- I love you.

566
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,549
We are gonna be fine.

567
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:26,653
Other people going to vacations,

568
00:58:26,654 --> 00:58:28,362
they spend their days

569
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:31,256
just laying around,

570
00:58:31,346 --> 00:58:33,557
eating and drinking.

571
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:35,668
That sounds pretty good right now.

572
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,824
Actually that could.

573
00:58:39,312 --> 00:58:40,463
This'll be the story we'll be telling

574
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:42,913
for the rest of our lives.

575
00:58:48,807 --> 00:58:51,582
- Daniel.
- What?

576
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,515
Look. Wait.

577
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,185
Oh, my God.

578
00:59:03,576 --> 00:59:06,093
Wait. They are five of them.

579
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,075
Look. Hold on.

580
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:09,866
Where those comes from?

581
00:59:10,097 --> 00:59:12,811
You know how dry my mouth gets
when I'm diving,

582
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:13,838
I wanted put them in the dive's bag

583
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:15,083
but you had it,

584
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,159
so I stuffed them in here
at the last minute.

585
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:22,315
Oh. Never thought anything
could taste so good.

586
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:27,071
Just hold me for a second, ok?

587
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:28,799
I gotta make sure
we don't lose these ones.

588
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,758
I got you.

589
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:30,837
Ok.

590
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:34,572
- You're done?
- Yeah.

591
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:39,731
What is it?

592
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:41,429
You are all right?

593
00:59:48,075 --> 00:59:49,466
Oh, my God.

594
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:01,088
- I don't see it.
- Are you ok?

595
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:02,261
I don't know.

596
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:07,980
I'm bit.

597
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:08,695
Oh, my God, honey.

598
01:00:08,696 --> 01:00:09,845
I'm bit.

599
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:11,399
The fucker bit me.

600
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:13,317
Ok, Hold on.

601
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:15,302
I'm gonna look.

602
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:20,498
Oh, God. It fucking hurts.

603
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,105
Daniel, breathe, ok?

604
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:23,536
Stay right here.

605
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,500
I'm gonna look. Ok?

606
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:29,096
I'm gonna go look.
You keep breathing.

607
01:00:29,123 --> 01:00:30,272
Daniel, listen to me.

608
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:32,745
- I'm going to go look. You breathe.
- I'm breathing.

609
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:37,178
Ok. Stay where you are.

610
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,784
I can't see.

611
01:00:51,372 --> 01:00:54,351
My leg is still there, right?
I can feel it.

612
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:55,628
Ok.

613
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,090
It's all right, honey.

614
01:01:00,675 --> 01:01:03,168
You gotta put something on it.

615
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:04,701
Ok. It's bleeding.

616
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:08,059
It's bad, isn't it? It's bad.

617
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:12,193
No. It's not that bad.

618
01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:13,718
Ok, I'm going to tie something around it.

619
01:01:13,718 --> 01:01:15,156
Just keep breathing for me, ok?

620
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:16,690
I'm breathing.

621
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,032
God, it fucking hurts.

622
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:20,473
I'll put my weight belt
tethering around it. You wait.

623
01:01:57,642 --> 01:01:59,706
This can't be happening.

624
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,933
How could this be happening.

625
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:03,970
I got bitten by a shark.

626
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,941
We could actually be
eaten alive by shark out here.

627
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:12,576
We don't know anybody
who's ever been bitten by a shark.

628
01:02:12,987 --> 01:02:13,753
There are always three or four guys

629
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:16,917
there on the shark show.

630
01:02:16,918 --> 01:02:19,412
Hey, it's all right. It's not that bad.

631
01:02:19,413 --> 01:02:21,329
It's going to be fine, ok?

632
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,768
You are going to have
a nice scar to show your friends

633
01:02:22,769 --> 01:02:24,261
and that's it.

634
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,173
Ok? Look at me.

635
01:02:26,174 --> 01:02:27,563
Look at me, baby.

636
01:02:27,564 --> 01:02:29,961
That's right. You are fine.

637
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:30,776
You are not that bad.

638
01:02:30,777 --> 01:02:31,520
Just hurts right now.

639
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:34,258
The salt water will make it get better

640
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:33,965
It's ok. Just hold on.

641
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:36,266
Just breathe.

642
01:04:36,267 --> 01:04:39,370
It's ok that it hurts.

643
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:46,529
Oh, God. Something
is trying to get to my foot.

644
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,635
It's a big one.

645
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:08,232
I love you.

646
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:19,337
Stay still. Stay where you are.

647
01:05:19,338 --> 01:05:22,780
It's gonna be ok. You hold on.

648
01:05:22,781 --> 01:05:23,930
You hold on, Daniel.

649
01:05:23,931 --> 01:05:26,687
You don't leave me out here, by myself.

650
01:05:27,864 --> 01:05:31,192
You promise me you'll hold on.

651
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:37,630
- My leg!
- Daniel!

652
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:29,089
Hello? Hello?

653
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,657
It's the manager. Hello?

654
01:14:52,162 --> 01:14:54,509
- So what's the final weight on it?
- 2.13

655
01:15:02,904 --> 01:15:06,338
Give me a knife.

656
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:14,940
How's that?

657
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:17,604
Good?

658
01:16:02,748 --> 01:16:05,497
That's what it ate.

659
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:12,186
Check it out.

660
01:16:13,105 --> 01:16:15,975
Man, they really do eat anything.

661
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,914
I wonder if it works.
