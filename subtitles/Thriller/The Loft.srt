1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,004
I swear to God, I had
nothing to do with this.

2
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,402
We would love
to believe you, Mr. Stevens.

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,881
But you have to admit, your version
of events does sound pretty bizarre.

4
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,961
Don't you think?

5
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,089
Look, it was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.

6
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,050
So you were framed, that's
your claim, you were the victim?

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,244
Well, I mean, you know, not...

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
- Not like...
- Not like who?

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,725
Not like her?

10
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,684
Please, just talk
to the other guys.

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,761
Have you talked
to the others yet?

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,887
We're doing our jobs.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,167
So, why don't you just
do yourself a favor and confess.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,607
You'll save some time,
save some legal fees. Come on.

15
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
Why don't you take us
through the events of this morning?

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,368
Again?
Again, Mr. Stevens.

17
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,849
Where were you
this morning, Mr. Stevens?

18
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,447
I was at home. Alone. My
wife's taken the kids skiing.

19
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,807
Actually, your wife's on her
way back, as we speak.

20
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,402
And apparently, she has quite
a few questions of her own.

21
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,008
So the phone woke you
around what time this morning?

22
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,481
I don't know.
9:00, 9:30?

23
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,847
It was Luke, in a panic.
He said I had to come.

24
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,001
Where were you supposed to go?

25
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,003
To the loft. He told
me to come to the loft.

26
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,047
Did he say why he was panicking?

27
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,121
No.

28
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,680
But did you know
why he was panicking?

29
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,765
No. Not yet.

30
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,361
Luke?

31
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,966
Luke?

32
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,364
Oh, my God!

33
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,529
Oh, fuck!

34
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,681
What the hell happened?

35
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,241
I don't know.

36
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,209
What do you mean?
You just...

37
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,965
I walked in,
she was lying there and...

38
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,685
Oh, fuck.

39
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,725
Have you called the others?

40
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,530
Chris and Marty
are on their way.

41
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,364
I still haven't reached Philip.

42
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,444
Okay. Well, keep calling.
We need everybody here.

43
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,810
Do you know who she is?

44
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,323
Vincent. Do you know
who's lying there?

45
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,841
What?

46
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,329
No. Of course not.

47
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,201
Well, how the fuck
did they get in?

48
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,248
What, was it a window, a door?

49
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,924
Windows are sealed,
the door was locked,

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,889
and the alarm was turned off.

51
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,610
That's impossible.
I'm telling you.

52
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,001
The door was locked
and the alarm was turned off.

53
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,201
But, that'd mean that...
Someone got in

54
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,009
with one of our keys.

55
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,286
Do you know the loft building

56
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
at the corner of 2nd and
South Hope, Mr. Seacord?

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,367
No.

58
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,249
You know, the new residential
one, down by the sports arena,

59
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,687
designed, I believe, by your
good friend Vincent Stevens?

60
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,291
Vincent runs a very large firm.

61
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,930
He's done a lot of buildings.

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,890
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr.
Seacord. Have you ever been there?

63
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
No.

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,321
Strange.

65
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,004
Because according
to our information,

66
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,923
you and four friends
are sharing this loft.

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,241
Secretly, without
your wives' knowledge.

68
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,810
That is ridiculous.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,207
Don't the five of you
bring women up there?

70
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,847
Girlfriends, mistresses, one-night-stands?
Catch of the day?

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,365
Five pals just looking
for privacy and fun

72
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,771
without the hassle
of Visa statements

73
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,251
and hotel bills
the missus might find.

74
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,129
That is preposterous.

75
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,486
Maybe, Mr. Seacord.

76
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,405
But one of your friends already
made a full confession.

77
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,609
You wanna know who?
Listen.

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,286
I don't do things
like that, you know,

79
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,169
fool around with
other women. I...

80
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,241
You love your wife.

81
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,527
I love my wife, yes.

82
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,046
What happened
to your face, Mr. Seacord?

83
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,961
I walked into a door.

84
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
Or were you in a fight? I
said, I walked into a door.

85
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,606
Where were you this morning?

86
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,922
Out with Chris,
having breakfast.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,968
There will be a lot of people in
the restaurant to verify that.

88
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,601
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris
Vanowen, the psychiatrist?

89
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,681
That's right.

90
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
- One of your loft buddies.
- Chris is married.

91
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,007
He's got two kids
and, no, he's not a guy

92
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,650
who cheats on his wife, either.

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,760
We've got a serious
fuckin' problem, Chris.

94
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,245
Oh, shit...

95
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,326
Philip.

96
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,481
Philip?

97
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,049
What? You think your brother
has something to do with this?

98
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,121
No.

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,601
We gotta call the cops.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,049
You realize what'll happen if we call
the cops? Think about our wives.

101
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,849
There's a dead woman
here, Vincent.

102
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,405
Why do we think
Philip is involved?

103
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,403
Look, Chris. You know
what he's capable of.

104
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,811
Yeah, I know.

105
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,726
Maybe we can help him, okay?

106
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,565
If we can just figure out
what the fuck happened and...

107
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,244
And then what? We're gonna
dump the body somewhere?

108
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,051
Look, I don't fucking know, but
I'm not taking the fall for this!

109
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,967
Marty.

110
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,925
Son of a bitch...

111
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,364
Have you seen Phil? Do you know where
he is? Was he here last night?

112
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,160
This can't be real.

113
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,443
No. Wait,
what are you doing?

114
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,081
I want to see her.

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,521
Put her back.

116
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,964
Oh, God damn it.
Who is she?

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,281
I don't know.

118
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,171
Look, none of us has anything
to do with this, right?

119
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,401
Right?

120
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,964
We're gonna find out what happened
here and we will figure a way out.

121
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,524
We're in this together, we'll
get out of it together. Okay?

122
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,051
'Cause we're friends.

123
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,446
Agreed?

124
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,566
Agreed?

125
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,520
Well, it looks like they'll
let anybody in, right?

126
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,329
- Congratulations, Vin.
- Thanks.

127
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,364
This one's really spectacular.
Very special. I appreciate that.

128
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,881
Ally, it's been too long. You
look terrific. Thank you.

129
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,005
So, uh, what do you think?

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,489
Well, it's bold and focused.
As always. I like it.

131
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,569
Great! You made it. Hi. Hi.

132
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,765
Hi, Barbara.
How are you?

133
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,569
Want to buy yourselves
a little condo?

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,921
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,401
Right, you and your puny
psychiatrist's salary.

136
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,921
You guys grab a drink. And we'll
catch up with you later. Alright?

137
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,161
Alright.
Congrats, bud.

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,241
Thanks, man.

139
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,767
One hour tops,
and then we're out of here.

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,604
Oh, come on, hon.
We just got here.

141
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,488
Check out all these babes.
So hot!

142
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,682
It's like they're in violation
of the fuckin' fire code!

143
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,285
Marty, calm down.
I see them.

144
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,568
I can also see Mimi, your wife.

145
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,482
Okay, save me,
help me, protect me.

146
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,369
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?

147
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,205
No. Just checkin' out the hipster
crowd with my pal Luke.

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,361
Mmm-hmm.

149
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,171
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll
leave you here all by yourself.

150
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,487
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them.

151
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,006
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,445
Oh, she was just feeling dizzy.

153
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,289
Ducked out to check
her blood sugar.

154
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,843
Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,965
Oh, I, um, started to feel not-so-great
before, but I'm better now.

156
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,810
We can always go home, sweetie.

157
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Did you hear that?
"Sweetie!"

158
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,529
After she just checked
her blood sugar.

159
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,443
That's funny.
That's really good.

160
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,841
I would love to see you deal with
something like that if that was me.

161
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,207
Oh, you know, baby, I'd love to
stick you in the ass every day.

162
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,810
- How many times have I asked?
- Honey?

163
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,006
Lots.
Not now.

164
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,725
You're the shrink, aren't you?

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,846
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.

166
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,850
Ah, Dr. Vanowen, that's right.
Yes, I remember.

167
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,283
Do we know each other? Uh, no.
You knew my sister.

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,011
She was a patient of
yours actually. Sophie?

169
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,487
Sophie Morris?

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,921
Oh.

171
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,007
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,204
Some people
are just born unhappy.

173
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,083
I'm sorry. Are you
buying an apartment?

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,602
What? Um, no, no. I'm
friends with the architect.

175
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,681
Ah.

176
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,081
Are you?

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,848
No, I'm here with Joel Kotkin.
The city councilman.

178
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,725
I work for him as sort
of a personal assistant.

179
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,041
Oh.

180
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,443
I'm Anne. Anne Morris.

181
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,806
Very nice to meet you, Anne.

182
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,121
And listen, about your sister...

183
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,009
It's okay.

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,880
You couldn't have saved her. Her mood
disorder kind of runs in the family.

185
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,962
Unfortunately, so...

186
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,131
Well, you're not thinking of doing
something stupid, are you, Anne?

187
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,201
Me?

188
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,365
Oh, you mean like falling
for the wrong man? Well...

189
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,489
I do that all the time.

190
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,521
Everything's alright!
Come on, keep partying!

191
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,647
What are you doing?

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,245
Phil, I should've guessed.

193
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,170
Hey, Vince, what's up? Hey. How are ya?
Thanks for comin'.

194
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,129
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped, man.

195
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,964
No worries. As long as you're okay.
You alright?

196
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,326
I'm fine.
She's fine. Come on.

197
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,085
Let me introduce
you to a colleague

198
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,886
who works with me at the office.

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,004
And this one works with
me down at the office.

200
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,690
Or is it the other way around?

201
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,841
Philip?

202
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,127
Oh, my big brother.
How ya doin', man?

203
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,962
Friends of Vicky's? Bridesmaids?
Oh...

204
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,327
Come on, man. I'm still single, you know?
What are you doing?

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,562
What? It's not like I don't
love my little Vicky.

206
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,369
I love her madly, you know that.
Alright?

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,363
It's not like I hate all the
other women in the world.

208
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,363
Alright.
Alright. Relax.

209
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,091
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.

210
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,686
Chris?

211
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,725
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.

212
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,440
Wow!
This is impressive, Vince.

213
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,401
Check out the view.

214
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,047
Then imagine that this
is our own private oasis

215
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,485
right in the heart of downtown.

216
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,407
What do you mean?

217
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,369
A place where
no one hassles you.

218
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,844
A place you can escape
to any time you want.

219
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,451
So this is your loft?

220
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,244
No. It's ours.

221
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,249
- If you want it.
- What?

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,681
Ours?

223
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,291
Think about it.

224
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,649
No messy hotel bills. No
questionable credit card activity.

225
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,807
This would be our secret place to steal
away, discreetly and economically

226
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,009
in these challenging times.
A five-way split.

227
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,480
What do you think?

228
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,689
I don't know.
I'm not like that.

229
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,442
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little like that.

230
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,165
Yeah. Tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.

231
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,130
Bring your twins up here, give
'em a little private tour.

232
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,326
You know what they cost, Marty?

233
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,801
How much? I might have it
on me right now. Seriously.

234
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,611
Think about it.
It's a great investment.

235
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,968
A once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity.

236
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,921
I can't stay here.

237
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,883
- Where you going? Luke?
- Hey, hey!

238
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
You cannot freak out right now.

239
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,442
We have to stay
together like we said!

240
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,727
Alright. Really, Luke, you
just need to calm the fuck down.

241
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,247
No! No! It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!

242
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,124
It's not over.
Listen, we're gonna find out

243
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,043
what happened here
and we're gonna fix it!

244
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,121
Okay?

245
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,087
Try Phil again.

246
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,881
<i>This is Philip. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

247
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,281
What if he doesn't show?

248
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,441
He could be out of
the country by now.

249
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,567
He'll show.

250
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,649
We can't cover for him,
Chris. Not this time.

251
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,561
Guys!

252
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,161
Look at this.

253
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,486
What's it mean?
What does it mean?

254
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,890
You know Latin, Doctor?

255
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,206
Excuse me?

256
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,567
Latin.
Do you know Latin?

257
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,211
I took it, pre-Med, yeah.

258
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,448
What's it say on the wall there?

259
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,044
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>

260
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,929
Yeah, I know.
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>

261
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,963
I can read that.

262
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,321
What's it mean?

263
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,091
I'm guessing you already
know what it means.

264
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,208
No. We would like
to hear you say it.

265
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,648
You'd like to hear me say it. Okay.
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit."</i>

266
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,449
"Fate will unite us."

267
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,049
Now, all I can
possibly think is that

268
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,049
somebody who knows
Latin like you,

269
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,043
reached over with
this young lady's hand

270
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,646
and wrote, <i>"Fatum nos
iungebit"</i> on the wall.

271
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,966
<i>"Fatum nos iungebit"</i> is wrong.

272
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,610
How so, Doctor?

273
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,044
The future imperfect tense of the verb
unite, <i>iungere</i>, is not <i>iungebit</i>.

274
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,566
It's <i>iunget.</i> It should
say, <i>"Fatum nos iunget."</i>

275
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,928
So the person you're looking for
made a classic Latin error.

276
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,890
But I'm guessing you knew that
already, too, didn't you?

277
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,649
You know the phrase "fuck you"?

278
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,760
Germanic origin.

279
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,761
Where's your brother?

280
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,442
I'm sorry, I can't
help you with that one.

281
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,126
Right. Well, actually, he's
your half-brother, isn't he?

282
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,441
Same mother, different fathers.

283
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,769
He spent some time in various
institutions with your half-sister, Zoe?

284
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,171
Yeah. That's right.

285
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,488
After our mother died, uh,

286
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,646
Philip wasn't as
lucky with his father.

287
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,526
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.

288
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,681
Mmm-hmm.

289
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,609
You didn't spend much time with
Philip back then, did you?

290
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,604
No. But now you're best friends.

291
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,011
Well, we've had a lot
of catching up to do.

292
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,004
You really don't know
where we can find him?

293
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,524
"Fate will unite us"? Where the
hell's your brother, Chris?

294
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,647
I don't know.

295
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,170
What the hell is this?

296
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,971
Where the fuck is Philip?

297
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,087
I'm right here.

298
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,085
Now, what the hell's going on?

299
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,361
You did this.

300
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,801
You did this!

301
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,206
- Luke!
- Hey! Luke!

302
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,611
- What?
- Luke, come here! Hey!

303
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,846
- Hey!
- Hands off!

304
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,524
Come on! Bring it on! What is this?
Cool it, Philip.

305
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,761
Luke!

306
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,841
Holy shit.

307
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,206
Did you have anything
to do with this?

308
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,281
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

309
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,203
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?

310
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,408
- Of course not!
- Jesus!

311
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,521
Were you here last night?

312
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,444
No, man. I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws'.

313
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,000
If you don't
believe me, call Vicky.

314
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,809
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?

315
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,524
I was at a project site,
alright?

316
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,806
With my father-in-law.

317
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,286
Oh, my God...

318
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,687
Where were you last night?
Where have you been?

319
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,761
- Philip! Take it easy.
- Wait a minute.

320
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,490
Before accusing everyone else,
where have you been?

321
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,928
'Cause I never got a text to
say the loft was taken. Never.

322
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,761
Last night I was at home.

323
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,841
Can you prove it?

324
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,042
No. I can't prove it. Because
Barbara's taken the kids skiing.

325
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,087
You'll have to
take my word for it.

326
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,161
Relax! Come on!
Your word?

327
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,131
There's a dead woman in our loft
that only us have access to.

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
Now, if anybody has
anything to do with this,

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,849
now's the time to say it.
Right now.

330
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,041
Thank you very much.

331
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,441
Well, Philip's
got a ball and chain now.

332
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,571
Who would've thunk it?

333
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,971
Who's the
father-in-law again?

334
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,728
His name's Hiram Fry. He's
a huge property developer.

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,962
His friends call him
the Man of Steel.

336
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,806
Worth millions.
Vicky's his only daughter.

337
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,206
So what's not to love?

338
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,487
I just hope
Philip will be happy.

339
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,011
Well, that's cozy.

340
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,167
Come on.

341
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,487
Ever since Councilman
Kotkin got elected,

342
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,648
the Man of Steel's been
busy rebuilding downtown.

343
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,290
Kotkin came to
your opening, right?

344
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,930
Yeah, he turned
up for a photo op.

345
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,321
When it comes to handing out
permits and contracts though,

346
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,044
the game's rigged.

347
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,610
Wait a minute. Tell me what
we're talking about again,

348
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
'cause I just saw
some mini cheesecakes.

349
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,165
Gorgeous, huh?

350
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,208
I mean, this whole setup.

351
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,850
Whoever said money can't buy happiness
sure hasn't lived this life.

352
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,442
Sorry, boys, you've lost
your bachelor mascot.

353
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,010
He's all mine now.

354
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,004
Good luck with breaking this bronco,
Vicky. God knows others have tried.

355
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,570
But I'm not others,
am I, Philip?

356
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
She told you.

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,480
And it's not just me.

358
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,807
Philip's married
into the Fry family now.

359
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,211
Oh. Soon as we're
back from Fiji...

360
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,409
Yeah. Well, gonna sell some
properties with Vicky's dad.

361
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,766
You know, see how it grabs me.

362
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,205
Wow. Grabs you!

363
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,408
Well, guys, thanks for coming.

364
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,851
Congratulations.

365
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,410
I'll be with you
in a second, baby.

366
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,171
Oh, man, I need a break
from all the ass-kissing.

367
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,651
Shit.

368
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Where is Fiji?

369
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,761
I don't know.

370
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,569
You look beautiful.

371
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,727
Phil.

372
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,730
Your wedding present.

373
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,485
Are you for real?
Absolutely.

374
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,769
Don't lose it. There's only
five of these in existence.

375
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,850
Accepting a key to the loft means
you accept the rules to the loft.

376
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,684
Marty.
Oh.

377
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,808
Are you crazy?
Our wives are here.

378
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,886
Don't you think that's a bit cynical,
handing those things out here?

379
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,089
Cynical? It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.

380
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,525
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now. Maybe later.

381
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,967
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?

382
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,967
Come on!

383
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,766
Atta boy.

384
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,330
Wow!

385
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,161
You just make sure this doesn't
blow up in your faces.

386
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,600
How's it gonna
blow up in our face?

387
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,051
It's just a room,
like Vince said.

388
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,451
Our room.

389
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,127
Now we keep it to ourselves.
Alright? We tell nobody.

390
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,521
It just stays within our circle.
Marty?

391
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,761
Yeah?
Yeah!

392
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,241
Now you just need to find someone
willing to go with you, Marty.

393
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,446
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

394
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,409
Yeah. I think there's plenty
of choices right here.

395
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,721
Some of these guys bring some
premium grade, high test pussy.

396
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,047
Like that dewy-eyed
vixen right there.

397
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,642
She looks underage.
No, she's 20.

398
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,086
And if one of you
guys messes with her,

399
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm gonna crack
your head wide open.

400
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,209
Oh, what, do you got
dibs on Miss Curly Locks?

401
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,527
Listen, man, that's Zoe.
Alright?

402
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,321
- Zoe?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,768
- Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,646
I hate to say it, Phil, but your
little sister's seriously hot.

405
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,290
Thanks, man. MARTY: She's
not little anymore.

406
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,044
That is the finest
piece of ass...

407
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,963
- Yo, Marty, that's enough.
- I'm just sayin'.

408
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,371
I'd like to fuck
her like an animal.

409
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,289
Come on, Marty. That's enough!
Feel her from the inside.

410
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,601
<i>I wanna fuck you
like an animal...</i>

411
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,926
You don't sing, you don't laugh,

412
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,280
you don't talk about my sister.

413
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,129
Got it? You got it?

414
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,644
Don't fuck with me...
You watch it.

415
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,761
You watch it.

416
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,127
I'll kick your ass
at your own fuckin' wedding.

417
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,767
Hi.

418
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,761
Hi.

419
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,251
We met at the,
uh, building opening.

420
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,163
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.

421
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.

422
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,881
Mmm.

423
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,086
I see you work weekends.

424
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,131
What a dedicated
personal assistant.

425
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,242
What a lucky city councilman.

426
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,691
Screw him.

427
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,886
Do you?

428
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,922
Must get a bit boring walking around
all these parties by yourself.

429
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,802
He wants you close,
but not too close.

430
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
Not when there's
important people around.

431
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,768
I told you,
I fall for the wrong men.

432
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,764
Can you keep a secret?

433
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,570
Our city councilman likes
to keep my panties with him

434
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,290
at these events, in his pocket.

435
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,083
It's a turn-on for him, the thought
of me in a crowd, so naked.

436
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,091
Only he knows.

437
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Why do you let him
use you like that?

438
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,442
Who says he's using me?

439
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,091
Maybe it turns me on.

440
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,203
Maybe me telling you about
it turns me on even more.

441
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,804
I hope you don't catch cold.

442
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,040
Chris!

443
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,050
Chris, I'm sorry.

444
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,645
I don't know,
maybe I was testing you.

445
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,808
I don't need to be tested.

446
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,165
Listen, do you want
maybe get a cup of coffee?

447
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,884
Some place quiet?

448
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,321
Private?

449
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,243
I'd like to use your key.

450
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,721
Just once.
It's not what you think.

451
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,167
Hey, it doesn't
matter what I think.

452
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,681
Have fun.

453
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,326
Does everyone still have a key?

454
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,481
'Course we do.

455
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,160
It's crucial we get this right.

456
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,806
Five keys were cut. To make a
sixth, you'd need the code.

457
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
Which is in my safe,
so we can rule that out.

458
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,171
But there was no break-in. So
does everyone still have a key?

459
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,846
What? You think we've been
givin' away our keys?

460
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,001
It's against your rules, Vince.

461
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,127
Then show me.

462
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,362
What are we trying
to prove here?

463
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,960
Look, I don't know. Maybe
someone's lost a key, okay?

464
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,166
Let's just rule that out.

465
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,368
Okay? Look, here's mine.

466
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,487
Alright?

467
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,206
Chris?

468
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,609
You didn't use a key
to get in just now.

469
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,163
No. I didn't bring it.
Where is it?

470
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,485
I don't have it on me, okay.

471
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,244
It's not like I need it every
day, like some of you guys.

472
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,321
But you do still have it?

473
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,210
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on
me right now is really not important.

474
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,964
It's extremely
fuckin' important!

475
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,122
Someone got in using a key
and yours is missing!

476
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,281
Is that right, Vincent?

477
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,488
Then how do you account for the
fact that the alarm was shut off?

478
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,125
So, let's just cut the bullshit,

479
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,282
'cause it definitely
had to be one of us five.

480
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,961
Unless...

481
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,361
Unless what?

482
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,929
Unless she let him in.

483
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,921
Oh, yeah. Then how'd
she get in, Vincent?

484
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,127
Any way you look at it, it
keeps coming back down to us.

485
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,400
And I for one would like to
know who's hiding something.

486
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,046
<i>Where did you learn that?</i>

487
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,281
<i>I seriously don't believe it.</i>

488
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,361
There's a word for that?

489
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,441
Yes, polyamory.

490
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,682
It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system

491
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,290
about being
romantically involved

492
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,771
with more than one
person at the same time.

493
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Uh-huh. And your
boss gets away with it?

494
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,203
Yes. He says that he's in love
with his wife and his girlfriend,

495
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,765
- so why should he have to choose?
- Uh-huh.

496
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,683
And his wife is
amazingly cool with it.

497
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,724
Oh, really? Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?

498
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,847
Explain. I'd like to know.

499
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,251
That sounds like my kind
of philosophy, Barb.

500
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,482
What's it called again?
Polly and Marie?

501
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,881
Please. Spare us, Tubs. You
can barely handle one woman.

502
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,729
What would you do with two? Mmm.

503
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,211
Bury one.

504
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,646
I would make up something,

505
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,405
some sort of game that involves
two ladies and one guy.

506
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,608
Start a trapeze
act or somethin'.

507
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,361
Could you at least
fake some enthusiasm?

508
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,891
It's your party.

509
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,845
Anyway, I'm cooking.

510
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,290
If you absolutely have
to invite your friends over,

511
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,011
could you at least try
to make it home on time?

512
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,721
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?

513
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
I just hope the pudgy clown
doesn't puke on the rug.

514
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,327
He's been chugging vodka
like it's Evian.

515
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,528
I mean,
doesn't his wife see that?

516
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,729
Actually,
she was just cool with it

517
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,006
long enough to
catch him in the act.

518
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,286
She hired a detective.

519
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,524
Cell phone records, credit card
receipts, audio, video, the works.

520
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,884
And in a heartbeat my poor boss
went from polyamory to alimony.

521
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,684
Oh.

522
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,762
Man, your boss
sounds mentally retarded.

523
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,803
So, what happened to him?

524
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,927
Oh. Uh...

525
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,482
He and his concubine are now cramped
in a tiny one-bedroom condo.

526
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,801
But I'm guessing he's happy.

527
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,929
She's blonde, 23, with a brand
new pair of fake breasts.

528
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,570
Ugh! How can men
stand fake breasts?

529
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,603
Why are women always

530
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,081
talking about "fake tits"
this "fake tits" that?

531
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,406
I mean, listen.

532
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,364
Girls, if it's a decent boob job,
who fuckin' cares, you know?

533
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,762
My mom, she's got,
uh, false teeth.

534
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,531
Okay? When she smiles, do
people give her shit and say,

535
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,806
"Oh, my God!
Look! Fake!"

536
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,406
No, they don't!

537
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,046
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now."

538
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,724
"It's an improvement."

539
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,368
You know, you women, you're
so catty, so competitive!

540
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,646
Calm down, Tubby dearest.

541
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,564
No. You know what? It's
nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.

542
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,321
I mean, a glorious big set of fuckin'
tits and a nice piece of ass,

543
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,890
it's thrilling!

544
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,291
It's thrilling!

545
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,171
This is
all a little too highbrow

546
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,130
for my teeny, tiny,
catty female mind.

547
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,288
Well, you know what? You
should have that enlarged.

548
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,851
Huh?
And while you're under,

549
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,046
you should have the comers
of your mouth lifted

550
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,884
so you can smile
every once in a while.

551
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,121
Sorry...sorry, Chris.

552
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,361
Marty. Come on.

553
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,566
What? No.

554
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,967
No, you're a class act, Marty.

555
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,088
Mimi, would you like to get
your husband another drink,

556
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,321
or should I do the honors?

557
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,283
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.

558
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,127
And then you go with her and stir.
Honey?

559
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,364
The problem with
your boss, Barbara,

560
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,249
is he didn't have
his shit together.

561
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,244
I mean, apart...
Apart, I mean.

562
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,926
No. I mean, he didn't
compartmentalize.

563
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,961
You guys agree?

564
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,041
Alright, Marty.

565
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,524
How would you compartmentalize?

566
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,329
How? Okay, well,
since you asked.

567
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,640
First thing first is I wouldn't have
a place that you could get caught.

568
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,889
Not a hotel,
not your girlfriend's crib.

569
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,327
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie-boy?

570
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,766
Am I right?

571
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,444
Marty, you've lost us all.

572
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,648
I doubt that.
I doubt that, Vinnie-boy!

573
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,605
Okay, first of all, sorry, baby.

574
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,765
I would just get a little one-bedroom
condo, or something like that.

575
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,806
God damn it!

576
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,486
Wow. You alright?

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,002
Mimi, your husband tends
to talk out of his ass

578
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,445
when he's been drinking.
Yeah?

579
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,600
Come on. There we go.

580
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,803
Hon, would you give me a hand?

581
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,487
Sure.

582
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,120
Sorry. Didn't know
you were in here.

583
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,965
No problem. Ate too
much too fast, I guess.

584
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,362
Thai food, you know. Yeah. It gets
all up in your nose and shit.

585
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,050
Yeah.
It's a little spicy.

586
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,006
Yeah.
I'm out of here. Bye.

587
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,680
I need to pick
up some more insulin.

588
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,764
Luke? Is there something
you wanna tell me?

589
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,923
Are you keeping secrets?

590
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,960
What kind of secrets?

591
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,209
Is there someone else?

592
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,926
I don't know why you start
asking me silly questions,

593
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,883
but the answer is no.

594
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,765
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.

595
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,928
That's not what
I'm asking, Luke.

596
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,164
I'm asking if
there's someone else.

597
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,561
Listen, sweetie.

598
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,927
Whatever I may be, or may not be

599
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,402
and I know I'm not
as glamorous as some

600
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,125
but I'll always
be there for you.

601
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,844
And the children.

602
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

603
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,246
I want you to know there's
a lot I could put up with.

604
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,010
What are you doing?

605
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,605
We need to get her out of here.

606
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,284
How?
She is shackled to the bed!

607
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,930
Can't you guys
see what's going on?

608
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Someone is trying to frame us!

609
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,287
Who?

610
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,407
Who wants to frame us?

611
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,891
I don't know.
But think about it.

612
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,526
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.

613
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,126
The Latin, the knife. Someone
did this for a reason.

614
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,565
Hell, the cops could
be here any second.

615
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,165
But none of us
know who this girl is.

616
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,329
We don't even know
how she got in here.

617
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,363
Who else knew
about the arrangement?

618
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,930
Who else knows
about our arrangement?

619
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,685
Did anyone blab? Tell one of the
girls that have been up here?

620
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,201
Marty?
What? Why me?

621
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,680
Some night you
were hammered, maybe?

622
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,210
I've always followed
the rules, Vincent!

623
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
Did you give anyone your code?

624
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,010
Did you key in while
someone was watching?

625
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,929
Absolutely not!
I just told you.

626
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,571
Alright. Wait. What's your point,
Vincent? Where you going with this?

627
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,324
Someone is trying to set us up.

628
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,481
Like who?
I don't know.

629
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,882
A rejected girlfriend, a jealous
boyfriend, betrayed husband,

630
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,450
someone with a motive.

631
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,842
Look, is one of you guys
in some kind of trouble?

632
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,721
I think I may be

633
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,404
falling in love with you.

634
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,645
You don't have to say that.

635
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,529
No, but I mean it.

636
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,886
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?

637
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,369
I've never
cheated on my wife before.

638
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,610
And I don't fall in love easily.

639
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,802
Chris,
I don't want you to love me.

640
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,726
You don't even know me, apart
from these stolen moments.

641
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,723
I mean, they're
exciting, yeah, sure.

642
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,811
But they're just moments.

643
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,764
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often.

644
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,410
Chris, please...
Not just for this.

645
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,891
No, stop it.

646
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,242
I don't want you to love me.

647
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,606
Well, I don't wanna
keep sneaking around.

648
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,004
I'm gonna tell Alison about us.

649
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,923
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

650
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,126
Anne.

651
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,642
I'm gonna leave her. Stop it!

652
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,243
Why are you doing this?

653
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,165
The people you love,

654
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,607
they're the only
ones who can hurt you.

655
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,602
I would never hurt you, Anne.
Stop.

656
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,081
Stop what? I don't know what
you're talking about. Would you...

657
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,891
Stop it, okay? You don't know me.
Okay? That's the end of it.

658
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,371
Well, would you give
me a chance at least to...

659
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
I'm a whore.
Alright?

660
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,327
What?

661
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,010
I'm a prostitute.

662
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,451
I fuck men for money.

663
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,284
Do you get it now?

664
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,167
Don't worry, Doctor.

665
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,571
I won't bill you for
the past few months.

666
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,971
Please, Anne, would you...

667
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,201
Chris...
Would you wait a minute?

668
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,850
Please. Stop it. You don't
know the half of it.

669
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,410
Alright?
Just go home.

670
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,006
Go home to your
wife and your kids.

671
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,211
Is your friend Chris Vanowen
cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?

672
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,327
Oh, I doubt that.

673
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,681
Chris is a very
devoted husband and a...

674
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,445
And a model dad, just like all
the rest of your pals, right?

675
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,646
Except for you.

676
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,722
You're not exactly squeaky
clean, are you, Marty?

677
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,484
Um, I don't know what you mean.

678
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,449
Why does your wife
want a divorce?

679
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,726
Divorce?

680
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,690
What we're going through, uh, separation.
It's a trial separation.

681
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,761
Why?

682
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,251
Um, because she
found out something

683
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,129
that she wasn't too happy about.

684
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,885
You fucked around on her.
If you wanna be technical.

685
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,891
How'd she find out?

686
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,930
The woman with whom I...

687
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,161
Fucked around?

688
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,527
Yeah.

689
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,081
Well, apparently expected
something a little more

690
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,527
and she showed up
on our front porch.

691
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,443
The bitch started to...

692
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,409
The woman in question
started saying things.

693
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,165
And my only hope is that Mimi
will come around eventually

694
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,083
because I love her very much.

695
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,810
Did you go with
this woman to the loft?

696
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,723
What? No.
This happened in San Diego.

697
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,922
That's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego?

698
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

699
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,121
Why were you there?

700
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,486
A commercial real
estate convention.

701
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,722
Vince had a couple of extra
tickets, a VIP thing.

702
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,002
You know, a couple nights
in a fancy hotel

703
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
and a chance to get
away for a couple days.

704
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,361
And nights.

705
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,164
Yeah. Nights, too.

706
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,290
<i>Man, do you see that?</i>

707
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,249
Jesus, Vince. Those girls
are drooling all over you.

708
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,089
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.

709
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,202
I'm happy with second best, too.

710
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,043
- He's cute.
- See him?

711
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,162
I'll take
a rain-check on that.

712
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,811
What? Are you fucking crazy? Why
wouldn't you invite them over?

713
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,450
'Cause, Marty,

714
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,962
I'd rather dive for some
rare and exotic sea creature

715
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,166
than shoot fish in a barrel.

716
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,927
Does Barbara know about these
deep-sea expeditions of yours?

717
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
What, are you kidding me?

718
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,167
Yeah. What's your
problem, Seacord?

719
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,084
You got a key to the loft. What
do you do up there, your laundry?

720
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,161
Dishes?

721
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,402
Hey! Are you guys here
on business, or what?

722
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,442
I'm Dana.
My first time here.

723
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,522
It's a little overpriced for
what you get, don't you think?

724
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,410
Hi, Dana. I'm Vincent.
This is Marty, Luke.

725
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,246
Can we, uh, buy you a drink?

726
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,326
Hey, when I said overpriced, I
wasn't trolling for free booze.

727
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
No...
I mean, I didn't think...

728
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,400
Well, since you asked,
what are you drinking?

729
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,329
Ooh, champagne?
A girl can dream.

730
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,890
Champagne?
Please.

731
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,166
Alright.
One champagne coming up.

732
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,563
What are you doing? The fat chick's
gonna scare off all the hot chicks.

733
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,167
Marty. Every fat chick
has a good-looking friend.

734
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,089
Hers is probably on her
way down right now.

735
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,481
Okay, yeah. Well, what if she
is the good-looking friend

736
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,483
and the really fat chick's
on her way down?

737
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,965
I think that's Philip's
father-in-law.

738
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,965
Oh. Yeah, it is.

739
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,451
I'll be.

740
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,130
That's the Man of Steel, alright.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.

741
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,808
Think we should give him a key?

742
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,001
Maybe. Not mine.

743
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,809
I'd like a bottle of your finest
champagne and four glasses, please,

744
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,410
for the table in the corner.

745
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,922
You, uh, were at
my daughter's wedding.

746
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,241
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.

747
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,850
Vincent Stevens.

748
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,201
We should talk sometime,
Mr. Stevens.

749
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,084
Sure. What do you
got in mind, Mr. Fry?

750
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,248
We have a new
waterfront project.

751
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,362
It's massive, it's cutting edge.

752
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,602
It might be right up your alley.

753
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,091
Of course, it's all preliminary.

754
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,162
We have to keep it under wraps.

755
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,282
I hope you can be discreet.

756
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,166
Sure.

757
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,009
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.

758
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,485
A word to the wise.

759
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,365
You are wise?

760
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,727
Yeah. Sure. Wise, uh...
Wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.

761
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,811
I'm in software. I can be
discreet myself, and wise.

762
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,962
I'll pick up their tab as well.

763
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,008
Well, have a nice
evening, gentlemen.

764
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,931
Sweetheart?

765
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,490
Sweetheart? Excuse me.

766
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,407
<i>Hi, this is Anne.
Leave a message.</i>

767
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,320
Who are you calling
at this hour?

768
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,483
No one, I was just checking
my voicemail.

769
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,891
And what does
your voicemail say?

770
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,881
That you're a lousy liar,
Chris Vanowen?

771
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,244
What are you talking...
ls something wrong?

772
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,403
You tell me, Chris.

773
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,484
Alison, I...
I'm going to bed.

774
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,921
Alison!

775
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,002
<i>Excuse me.
That's not thinking.</i>

776
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,525
It's called following
your dick around.

777
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,080
Okay, two kinds of articles in
Cosmo month after month.

778
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,850
One, men are pigs.

779
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,890
Two, how do I seduce
a pig to chop my wood?

780
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,726
- I don't read Cosmo month after month.
- Well, I do.

781
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,410
I don't...
Well, I do.

782
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,323
And I find it
strangely compelling.

783
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,129
You know what I find
strangely compelling? What?

784
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Your eyebrows.

785
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,885
Lumberjack contest.

786
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,566
I can't leave you
alone for a minute.

787
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,687
Oh, Sarah.

788
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,650
It's been more like an hour. I mean,
thank God I've been subsidized.

789
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,008
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your new friends?

790
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,040
<i>And that was
the first time you met her?</i>

791
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,801
Yeah. That was, uh...

792
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,522
- That was the first time.
- Sarah?

793
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,208
Yeah, her name was Sarah.

794
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,761
<i>Mr. Stevens, what
else happened in San Diego?</i>

795
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,645
What do you want to know?

796
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,085
Everything.

797
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,970
I got another one!

798
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,241
No!

799
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,970
Shh. Keep it down.
Keep it down.

800
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,162
This is insane, Sarah.

801
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,083
You should never
dare a crazy woman.

802
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,650
Vincent, we should
probably go back.

803
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,370
Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.

804
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,246
Mmm.
Hmm.

805
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,765
So I got you the pool...

806
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,600
Now you have to keep
your end of the bargain.

807
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,688
Come over here.
Let's sit.

808
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,886
Yeah.

809
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,611
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

810
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,241
Come on. Don't keep us
waiting. Take it off.

811
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,251
Think I'm gonna be sick.

812
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,810
What? Vince's body's
not that bad.

813
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,370
Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!

814
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,845
What? Dana!

815
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,170
Dana! Come back here!

816
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,881
Your turn.

817
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,606
No.

818
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,366
Take it all off.

819
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,560
Not bad.

820
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,045
Whoa!

821
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,926
Is this still
too scary for you, Luke?

822
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,763
Are you gonna join us?

823
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,763
I'm...
I'm fine right here.

824
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,330
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna
try and make a move on me soon.

825
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,085
And if you're here,
maybe he won't dare.

826
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,641
Well, maybe
Vincent's not interested.

827
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,121
Maybe Vincent'd rather do laps.

828
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,123
That would explain
the last few hours

829
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,129
of casual but meaningful glances

830
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,771
that each lasted
a second too long.

831
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,964
You like to play games, huh?

832
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,411
I do.

833
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,203
And I'll tell
you something else.

834
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,089
I'm better at it than you.

835
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,324
Can you feel me?

836
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,970
Most definitely.

837
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,721
Marty?

838
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,924
Marty, I need my room key.

839
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,162
Dude, I'm kind of busy here!

840
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,004
Don't stop!
Go!

841
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,450
Just do it!

842
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,447
You're scared, is what it is.

843
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,205
You're running away
from your feelings.

844
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,010
I don't want to say goodbye.

845
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,808
Do you have any idea what it's
like to really love someone?

846
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,726
I'm sorry.

847
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,120
What are you doing?

848
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,162
Throwing it away.
It's empty.

849
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,289
You were here yesterday,
weren't you?

850
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,766
Guys?

851
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,244
We gotta go to the cops. We're
not getting anywhere with this.

852
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,362
First, I think Vincent
has something to tell you.

853
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,730
Alright, let's hear it.

854
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,921
What the hell?

855
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,004
Hello?
Who is it?

856
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,806
Who is it?

857
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,202
It's a realtor
who wants to come up.

858
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,281
Somebody listed
the loft for sale?

859
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,361
What?

860
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,169
Oh, Jesus fucking...

861
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,844
Listed the loft?

862
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,840
She said she has an appointment
with a Deakins...

863
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,441
Sarah Deakins.

864
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,604
Who's Sarah Deakins?

865
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,329
Wait. Who the hell is
trying to sell our loft?

866
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,406
You know her, Marty.

867
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,361
What?

868
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,124
You know her, and so does Luke.

869
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,040
Sarah Deakins is
lying on the bed.

870
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,010
You guys, I promise, I've
never seen a Sarah Deakins.

871
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,286
That's not true.
You know her.

872
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,971
Why do you keep Saying that?

873
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,408
You met her in San Diego,
the last night, in the bar.

874
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,681
Remember? Dana's friend.

875
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,168
The last night? I was wasted out of
my mind. The whole night's a blur.

876
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,241
Jesus!

877
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,126
Luke, you remember
her, don't you?

878
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,605
That's Sarah?

879
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,887
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?

880
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,485
Yes.
I remember Sarah.

881
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,210
But how was I supposed
to know that's Sarah?

882
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,203
Come on, guys!
What the hell's going on?

883
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,409
You guys turned her over and
looked at her face. I did not.

884
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,485
Yeah. I think
there's been a mistake.

885
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,608
We don't know anyone
named Sarah Deakins.

886
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,405
Marty, come on!

887
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,244
Who is it? Do we know her?
I don't know.

888
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,446
Fuck!

889
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,680
So, is that all you
wanted to tell us, Vince?

890
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,560
Or is there more?

891
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,167
I had a thing with her.

892
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,161
I brought her up
here a couple times.

893
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,961
But I swear on my kids,

894
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,280
I had nothing to do with this.

895
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,407
Would you just fuckin' tell me?

896
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,641
Were you here
with her last night?

897
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,006
Were you the one who let her in?

898
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,528
I broke up with her last night.

899
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,440
I swear she was
alive when I left.

900
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,890
It still doesn't explain
why someone listed the loft!

901
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,727
Something special
or just browsing?

902
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,440
Why don't you return my phone calls?

903
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,811
If you're dumping me,
at least have the decency...

904
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,644
Chris, how can I dump you?

905
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,451
There's nothing between us.

906
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,645
So that's what I mean
to you? Nothing?

907
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,770
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?

908
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,330
No. I haven't.

909
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,962
It doesn't change
how I feel about you.

910
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,528
How many women have you
taken to that fuck-pad

911
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,160
you share with your
four little buddies?

912
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,729
What?
Please, Chris.

913
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,689
Save it for some girl who'll
actually buy your bullshit.

914
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,364
Anne...no.
Wait! Wait.

915
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,447
You know I'm not like that.

916
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,800
Here.

917
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,050
I only need this
if I'm with you.

918
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,565
So you keep it.

919
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,368
If you wanna see me again,
you let me know.

920
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,961
Chris?

921
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,684
Um, what are you doing here?

922
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,924
Shopping for Alison?

923
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,881
Uh, no...no, um, I was just
here with a colleague.

924
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,131
Does your wife know you've been
sharing the loft with your pals?

925
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,925
I already told you, I'm not
sharing a loft with any pals.

926
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,809
I was there just once,
at a party,

927
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,325
when the building first opened.

928
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,241
Then you have been there?

929
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,527
A minute ago, you didn't even
know where the building was.

930
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,568
I never took anyone up there. I
thought that's what you meant.

931
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,210
Well, did you know the girl?

932
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,090
We met once in San Diego.

933
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,447
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a
relationship with her in San Diego?

934
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,090
That would surprise me, frankly.

935
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,766
You didn't know? Isn't Vincent
Stevens your best friend?

936
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,604
It's so obvious what
you're trying to do here,

937
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,529
trying to turn us
against each other.

938
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,921
But guess what? I'm not about
to start trashing my friend.

939
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,769
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you
were jealous of your best friend?

940
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,081
When he's nailing all
these beautiful women?

941
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,204
I am a married man. I'm not
interested in nailing women.

942
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,442
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.

943
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,566
I didn't mean jealous
of him, Mr. Seacord.

944
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,529
I meant jealous of the women.

945
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,122
Where do you get off
with an innuendo like that?

946
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,090
Fucking bastards.

947
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,730
Why are you so angry,
Mr. Seacord?

948
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,404
Vincent is my closest friend.

949
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,289
And he has been for years.

950
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,880
Yeah. Fine.
But your best friend

951
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,566
is selling you out as
we speak, Mr. Seacord.

952
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,287
- You and the rest of your gang.
- No.

953
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,409
Vincent would never sell out his friends.
You're full of shit.

954
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,481
Asshole.

955
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,521
What'd you call me?

956
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,364
You heard me,
you lying piece of shit!

957
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,771
I broke up with her
and I left! That's it!

958
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,001
Yeah?

959
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,282
After you cut her up with this, right?
Put the knife down.

960
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,646
Philip!
I didn't kill her.

961
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,767
Back off.
Why?

962
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,842
Hey, put the knife...
Put the knife down!

963
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,046
Hey, hey!
Back off.

964
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,487
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.

965
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,846
Someone's trying
to pin this on us.

966
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,490
On you, you mean.

967
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,331
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!

968
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,846
Fuck!

969
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,041
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.

970
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,442
What do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh? Just leave me hanging?

971
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,761
Hey, Vince?
Vince? Are you in there?

972
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,810
If you're in there, hey, man, I need
to talk to you for just a second.

973
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,281
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?

974
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,930
Mimi's gone!

975
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,722
She's gone!
Fucking gone!

976
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,966
What do you mean gone?
Gone where?

977
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,087
She left me.

978
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,050
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up.

979
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,009
She told her everything.
Fuck!

980
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,845
Wait a minute. You didn't
tell Mimi about the loft?

981
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,130
What? It's not about the goddamn
loft, Vince! It's about my wife!

982
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,044
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her!

983
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,969
Did you confess?

984
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,486
Never confess, Marty.
Never confess.

985
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,360
Would you go to her? Just
tell her that I love her.

986
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,444
You know? And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.

987
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,403
Marty, I will straighten
this out for you.

988
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,561
I promise you,
I will straighten this out.

989
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,687
Okay.

990
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,129
Hey, come here.
It's okay.

991
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,921
Thanks.

992
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,810
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?

993
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,841
We get her out of here.

994
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,560
What? We can't just
make a body disappear.

995
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,440
Well, that's too bad.
It's our only hope.

996
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,171
You had a relationship with her.

997
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,410
Now she's some inconvenient
piece of evidence?

998
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,720
What kind of man are you?

999
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,131
That's a laugh, coming from you.

1000
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,844
And how do you plan
to get her off the bed?

1001
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,410
Cut off her hand?

1002
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,801
Or do you have
the key to those cuffs?

1003
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,086
You know what?
I thought handcuffs

1004
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,366
were more your thing
than mine, Phil.

1005
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,521
Meaning what?

1006
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,250
You know exactly what I mean.

1007
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,970
Shut up! Shut up! Just keep
your fuckin' mouth shut! Alright?

1008
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,087
Please!

1009
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,366
Help me! Please help me!

1010
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,930
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

1011
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,321
He's crazy!

1012
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,522
This fucking whore
started to rip me off!

1013
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,728
- Please help me! He raped me!
- Shut up!

1014
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,165
Hey...easy!
Alright!

1015
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,685
Alright!
We mean it.

1016
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,762
It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!

1017
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,163
Shit! Okay.

1018
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,881
Philip, give me the keys.

1019
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,246
The bitch is gonna
go to the cops, man.

1020
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,560
Gimme the keys to the handcuffs.

1021
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,726
She's gonna go to the cops!

1022
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,040
The keys!

1023
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,201
You want the key?

1024
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,600
He made me do things
that I didn't want to do.

1025
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,681
Shut up! Shut up!

1026
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,847
Easy.

1027
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,886
What? You want more money?
That's it, right?

1028
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,169
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!

1029
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,083
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!

1030
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,731
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
is the matter with you?

1031
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,080
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1032
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,485
She's a whore, Chris!

1033
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,204
- Do you know what a whore is?
- Shut up!

1034
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,248
You can't rape a whore!
You can't rape a whore!

1035
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,800
You can't rape...
Shut the fuck...

1036
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,886
You don't treat a woman
like that! You got it?

1037
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,041
Not any woman!

1038
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,160
Don't fuckin' touch me, alright?
Cool it!

1039
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,080
What the fuck's the matter with you, man?
You're putting us all at risk!

1040
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,605
I want police.
He hit me.

1041
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,330
Shut up.

1042
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,364
- He rape me!
- Shut up!

1043
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,560
Stop screaming! I'm gonna rip
your goddamn throat out!

1044
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,490
I've had it with you!

1045
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,130
You're no better
than your father!

1046
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,447
I'm what?

1047
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,806
You heard me.

1048
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,010
Alright, Chris.

1049
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,644
That's a nice one.

1050
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,682
Chris had a better deal
with his daddy, right?

1051
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,843
The great guy who
wants to save everyone.

1052
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,243
Where were you, when Zoe and
I were getting beat up?

1053
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,722
And Mom in the next room,
pretending not to hear.

1054
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,601
Where were you?

1055
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,969
In your cozy college dorm
getting laid and wasted,

1056
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,405
'cause you didn't give a fuck!

1057
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,481
I didn't know anything about it.

1058
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,561
You didn't give a crap!

1059
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,529
All those years we
didn't exist for you!

1060
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,170
I didn't know anything about it!

1061
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,440
If you would've told me, if
you would've said something!

1062
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,050
Then what, you phony?
Then what?

1063
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,761
Then I would've gotten you out of there!
God damn it! Both of you!

1064
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,961
Listen.

1065
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,486
I'm really, really sorry,
but we can't go to the cops.

1066
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,721
Here's what I'm gonna do.
No, listen.

1067
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,330
I have a friend, he's a doctor.
No...

1068
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,447
Yes.
I'm gonna drive you to him.

1069
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,443
He's gonna take
care of you. Okay?

1070
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,363
No...
No, here. Listen.

1071
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,721
Take it.

1072
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,720
I know it's not enough
for what happened tonight.

1073
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,124
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!

1074
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,481
Okay. And we're gonna
deal with him, I promise you.

1075
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,441
Come on. Now, get your clothes and
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.

1076
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,931
- No!
- Easy. Here we go.

1077
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,721
No!

1078
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,525
I'll never forgive
you for this. Never!

1079
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,009
What's your problem?

1080
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,766
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

1081
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,322
Why don't I know anything about this?
And when did it happen?

1082
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,091
A couple of weeks ago.

1083
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,685
We decided to
keep it to ourselves,

1084
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,285
'cause that's the kind
of friends we are.

1085
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,330
Don't lecture me, alright?
Especially about friendship.

1086
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh, right. Sorry. I meant to give
you the cokehead rapist lecture.

1087
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,121
Fuck you.

1088
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,481
Well, you could see how I think
you'd be involved in this.

1089
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,281
I need to say something.

1090
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,691
Oh, shit.

1091
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,363
- You had that coming!
- Hey! Take it easy.

1092
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,811
Relax. Take it easy.

1093
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,240
Get up!
You son of a bitch.

1094
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,011
You recorded everything
that went on here.

1095
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Every woman...

1096
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,644
Not every.

1097
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,564
Not always, just sometimes.

1098
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,846
At least I don't
cheat on my wife.

1099
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,888
No, you just watch us
and beat off.

1100
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,043
You sick fuck.
You're a sick fuck!

1101
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,287
Luke, did you record last night?

1102
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,401
No.

1103
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,127
You didn't say you were coming.

1104
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,804
Which is against your rules.

1105
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,245
And that wasn't the first time

1106
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,051
you broke your own
rules, by the way.

1107
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,046
Now you're scared, aren't you?

1108
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,320
Now you know I've
documented pretty much

1109
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,680
everything you've been
up to here.

1110
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,690
No worries, Vincent.

1111
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,411
I'll keep my mouth shut,
like I always do.

1112
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,369
Did you see anything
that can help us out here?

1113
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,921
Anything at all?

1114
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,931
If all the people
who've been hurt

1115
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,088
and cheated on
find out the truth,

1116
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,211
what do you think'll happen, Vincent?

1117
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,644
What's the matter?

1118
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,362
I just don't feel like
leaving tomorrow.

1119
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,329
Serious? You love skiing.

1120
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,961
Yes. I love to ski.
But just not by myself.

1121
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,411
Are you sure you can't come?

1122
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,403
Babe, you know I can't come.

1123
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,801
I can't just take off right now.

1124
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,922
Hey. I'll call you
every day.

1125
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,006
I love you.

1126
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,770
I know the drill.
One hour, right?

1127
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,446
Wrong. Have a blast,
don't mind me.

1128
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,841
Why should tonight be any different
from the past few months?

1129
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,720
Look, Alison, if it's alright with
you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.

1130
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,765
I'm sure it must be tempting

1131
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,161
to grab something shiny and new.

1132
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,046
But do you ever think about

1133
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,446
what you might
stand to lose, Chris?

1134
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,761
You could ruin a lot more
than just this evening.

1135
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,567
Tell me,
are you so happy, Alison?

1136
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,451
Well, what do you know?

1137
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,885
If it's for charity,
my mother-in-law

1138
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,406
is allowed to join the
party for a little while.

1139
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,043
You heard anything about
the waterfront project?

1140
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,805
No. He's gonna call
once he gets his permits.

1141
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,884
As far as I know,
everything's approved.

1142
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,729
Really?
Yeah.

1143
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,925
Good evening, gentlemen.

1144
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,241
Ladies, you look absolutely
ravishing tonight.

1145
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,321
Thank you.

1146
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,401
This is Vincent Stevens.

1147
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,569
He's the architect who designed the new
loft building near the sports arena.

1148
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,967
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.

1149
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,242
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.

1150
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,770
As I was saying to your
husband in San Diego,

1151
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,524
gentlemen in our business
can't afford to be exposed

1152
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,961
to the negative consequences
of bad design.

1153
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,003
Speaking of San Diego,

1154
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,481
how's that waterfront project
coming along?

1155
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,365
Oh, yes. We're still
working on it.

1156
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,680
We've applied for all our
permits and now we're waiting.

1157
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,041
Standing in line
like everyone else.

1158
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,649
You don't strike me as the type of
man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.

1159
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,166
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?

1160
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,246
Are you a gambling man?

1161
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,164
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?

1162
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,850
As a matter of fact, I do.

1163
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,129
Especially when I'm holding
a handful of hearts.

1164
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,924
Anyway, I don't mean
to interrupt.

1165
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,731
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the
tables tonight <i>as</i> you are in love,

1166
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,888
then I am sure you'll
hit your jackpots.

1167
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,042
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

1168
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,286
Blackjack!

1169
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,527
Wow!

1170
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,648
Ooh! Set aside enough
for the Ali-money.

1171
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,531
Mimi, what are you doin' here?

1172
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,404
Just 'cause I booted you out
doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.

1173
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,720
Pumpkin, I want to come back.

1174
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,241
I know I
screwed up once. Once.

1175
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,244
I was drunk off my ass. I swear
it didn't mean a damn thing.

1176
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,845
Something I don't understand
about men.

1177
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,042
If it doesn't mean anything,
why bother?

1178
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,367
I promise I'll change.
Into what, a frog?

1179
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,051
Certainly not a prince. How
'bout the ass you already are?

1180
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,083
What if I told you I wanted
to fuck around tonight?

1181
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,207
Sorry.

1182
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,770
It would
hurt like hell, wouldn't it?

1183
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,684
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.

1184
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,290
Maybe Chris, he's cute.

1185
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,010
Or how about Vincent,
the night you sent him over

1186
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,208
for that tragic
heart-to-heart? Aw.

1187
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,845
"Marty's really suffering."

1188
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,206
"Mimi, you've gotta
talk to him."

1189
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,001
Blackjack!

1190
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,282
Oh! Well,
look at that, Tubs,

1191
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,885
your first-ever
winning streak.

1192
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,525
Just remember, dear heart,

1193
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,401
half of it is mine.

1194
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,326
You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
Philip, let go.

1195
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,686
I keep her away from
bullshit like this,

1196
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,800
and then behind my back...

1197
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,041
Christ, Phil, she's almost
20 years old.

1198
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,121
What are you, her father?

1199
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,402
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.

1200
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,881
I thought you like whores.

1201
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,043
Yeah. Let her have some fun.

1202
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,645
If you'll excuse me, I'm
about to have some fun, too.

1203
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,767
I'm kind of on a roll.

1204
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,961
I hope you win big time.

1206
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,486
You'll need it with all the shit you've
been packin' up your nostrils.

1207
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,803
So you noticed a tiny
fraction of your stash went missing?

1208
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,486
Yeah. If you don't like it,
file for divorce.

1209
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,404
I haven't ruled that out. Don't forget
about our pre-nup, loser.

1210
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,164
While you're at it,
go play some blackjack.

1211
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,242
Could be your last best
chance at paying the rent.

1212
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,608
Can I get some dice over here?

1213
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,565
Hands-off.
Excuse me.

1214
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,806
Anne?

1215
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,281
Anne?

1216
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,801
We need to talk.

1217
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,882
Yeah? About what?

1218
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,405
Your pal, the architect.

1219
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,801
He's playing with fire.

1220
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,731
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.

1221
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,880
I'll pass along your
message to Vincent,

1222
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,644
but I'd like something, too,
Mr. Kotkin.

1223
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,562
I'd like for you to
stop seeing Anne.

1224
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,846
And why would I do that?

1225
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,371
Because I love her.

1226
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,403
Then we have more
in common than we thought.

1227
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,244
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.

1228
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,721
That's really not up to me.

1229
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,529
Fact is,
it's totally her choice.

1230
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,762
Except I never paid for her.

1231
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,321
Well, that's true.

1232
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,243
You never paid.

1233
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,049
Stop it, Joel.

1234
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,001
I'm going.

1235
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,360
What did he mean by that,
"You never paid"?

1236
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,445
I don't want to love you, Chris.

1237
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,931
Is he saying someone's
paying you to be with me?

1238
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,400
You're the only one
who can hurt me.

1239
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,841
Anne?

1240
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,684
Tell me it's a lie.

1241
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,760
The first time, it was paid for.

1242
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,967
Every other time, that
was real, that was me.

1243
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,090
But who paid?
I can't...

1244
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,960
Excuse me.

1245
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,963
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
I'm fine here.

1246
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,600
I'm asking you to
come with me. Come on.

1247
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,841
And I'm asking you to stop.

1248
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,763
Did you not hear the lady?
Mind your business.

1249
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
Stop!

1250
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,649
What, are you deaf
or just a dick, huh?

1251
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,166
I don't know, man.

1252
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,005
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?

1253
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,360
Help me out.

1254
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,086
Philip! Stop! Don't!

1255
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,087
Fuck!

1256
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,889
Come on! HIRAM: Excuse me.
Thank you.

1257
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,122
You're just like Dad!
Shut up!

1258
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,965
You are just like him! Somebody
get this guy an ambulance.

1259
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,881
I never want to see you again,

1260
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,930
not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?

1261
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,400
Get him the hell out of here.

1262
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,768
Okay, folks! Let's get back to
the gaming tables, shall we?

1263
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,801
Hey, it's okay.

1264
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,810
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.

1265
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,571
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

1266
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,330
It's not what you're thinking.

1267
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,531
And what am I thinking?

1268
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,807
She's my friend's sister, okay?

1269
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,680
Are there more? Besides
me, her, and your wife?

1270
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,886
What's the grand total?

1271
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,763
Look, I can't have
this conversation here.

1272
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,240
Barbara's standing
right over there.

1273
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,046
Do you love me?

1274
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,521
Of course I love you.
I'm crazy about you.

1275
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,001
But would you choose me?
If you could?

1276
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,604
You know it's not that simple.

1277
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,842
Come meet me at the loft tomorrow, okay?
We'll talk it through.

1278
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,402
You're right.
It's not that simple.

1279
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,650
But maybe I can make it simple.

1280
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,606
What do you mean?

1281
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,721
Maybe I can help you
make that choice.

1282
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,571
Sarah...

1283
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,766
Sarah.

1284
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,047
Sarah!

1285
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,326
Sarah!

1286
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,087
I'm sorry.

1287
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,286
Are you alright?

1288
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,851
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.

1289
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,285
They found out.

1290
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,968
<i>They set us up.
They set us up.</i>

1291
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,485
Our wives, they...

1292
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,721
They set us up.

1293
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,006
Why, Vincent?

1294
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,126
They...

1295
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,682
They found out. They found
out about the loft.

1296
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,250
Why would you do it, Vincent?

1297
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,367
We're your friends.

1298
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,361
No...

1299
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,521
Why did you do it?

1300
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,131
No...it was our wives.
They found out.

1301
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,884
No, it's your friends.

1302
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,450
We found out.

1303
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,846
What's going on?

1304
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,285
You still don't get it.

1305
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,765
Alright, strip him.

1306
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,771
What are you doing?

1307
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,842
You are a total
fucking psychopath.

1308
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,921
I did what you told me.

1309
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,365
I didn't tell you to
fucking cut her open!

1310
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,441
That wasn't a part of the plan.

1311
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,521
And the Latin on the bed?

1312
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,204
Like the cops are gonna
believe that bullshit.

1313
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,327
Then you should've
done it yourself.

1314
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,640
Come on. Let's do this.

1315
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,605
What'd you give me?

1316
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,003
What you deserve.

1317
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,006
You killed Sarah?

1318
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,009
No. We just found her.

1319
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,771
What?

1320
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,482
We were here this morning, Vincent.
Before you arrived.

1321
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,804
Jesus Christ.

1322
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,562
At first I thought
she was sleeping.

1323
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,004
Vincent knows her?

1324
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,845
She left him this.

1325
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,883
"See you in the next life."

1326
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,003
Why did she have to do it here?

1327
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,641
We gotta call the cops.

1328
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,927
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.

1329
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,001
Guys, wait.

1330
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,846
Can't we find out where she
lives and leave her there?

1331
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,251
Jesus!
Philip!

1332
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,010
Come on, we have to
help out Vince!

1333
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,163
Yeah. Speaking of which, where the
fuck is Vince? Isn't this his problem?

1334
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,481
Hmm...

1335
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,081
Vincent isn't here because“.

1336
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,851
- Because I didn't call him.
- You didn't call him?

1337
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,007
Why didn't you call him?

1338
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,288
There's something
I have to show you.

1339
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,406
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!

1340
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,329
You can beat the crap
out of me later.

1341
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,370
We don't have much time,
and you need to watch this.

1342
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,729
Maybe you'll get a new perspective
on what happened upstairs.

1343
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,442
Maybe you'll agree, we shouldn't
take the hit for Vincent's fuckup!

1344
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,089
You see, Vincent...

1345
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,048
Vincent hasn't always been
a good friend.

1346
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,241
No.

1347
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,001
<i>God!</i>

1348
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,445
Hey, maybe I already got even.

1349
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
<i>Or maybe Vincent,</i>

1350
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,642
<i>the night you sent him over for
that tragic heart-to-heart.</i>

1351
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,966
It's okay.

1352
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,481
They got here late, the night
he went to talk to her.

1353
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,524
She was drunk, Marty.

1354
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,329
He took advantage.

1355
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,968
Wow! Your little sister's
seriously hot.

1356
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,126
Hey...

1357
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,170
How long has it...
It doesn't matter.

1358
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,287
How long?

1359
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,680
He started seeing her
right after your wedding.

1360
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,326
They met here
on a regular basis.

1361
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,964
If I'm not mistaken,
he was her first.

1362
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,171
Fuck!

1363
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,725
Gorgeous, huh?

1364
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,726
<i>The people you love,</i>

1365
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,282
they're the only ones
who can hurt you.

1366
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,569
<i>He paid Anne</i>

1367
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,041
to let you seduce her,

1368
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,161
put the hook in, so you'd want

1369
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,049
a share of the loft.

1370
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,043
The first time, it was paid for.

1371
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,366
Have fun.

1372
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,411
Chris, please. You don't
know the half of it.

1373
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,481
Alright? Just go home.

1374
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,688
He used her, Chris.

1375
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,087
Just like he used everyone.

1376
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,840
Everyone.

1377
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,449
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

1378
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,484
Vincent can't sense anything
is up when he walks in.

1379
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,289
We have to try and remain calm.

1380
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,289
We're gonna get
questioned by the cops.

1381
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,641
That's why we can never admit
we're sharing this loft.

1382
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,087
Or they'll try to turn us
against each other.

1383
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,961
Okay. I think this can work.

1384
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,565
As long as we follow the plan.

1385
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,641
Chris?

1386
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,641
Okay. I'm in.

1387
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,246
But only if we know for sure that
Vincent was here last night.

1388
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,410
I wanna hear him say it. And if
he does, I'll go through with it.

1389
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,410
I'll give a signal...

1390
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,009
Break something, a glass.

1391
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,170
But nothing happens
until we know for sure.

1392
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,366
Understood?

1393
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,761
We've got just under two hours

1394
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,445
to set everything up
and establish alibis.

1395
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,760
I'll take care of it.

1396
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,047
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.

1397
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,291
You have the
suicide note, right?

1398
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,771
I've got it.

1399
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,680
You knew what that prick was up
to and you never said anything.

1400
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,762
You're just as sick as Vincent.

1401
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,131
<i>They met here
on a regular basis.</i>

1402

1410
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,883
What happened here?

1411
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,201
You're framing me!

1412
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,486
Oh, fuck!

1413
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,801
Jesus, swallow it.

1414
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,280
My own friends.

1415
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,890
My own friends!

1416
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,721
Am I gonna die?

1417
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,404
No, Vincent,
you're not gonna die.

1418
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,082
Sarah lured you here
and drugged you.

1419
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,926
Then she killed herself, with you
by her side. "Fate will unite us."

1420
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,251
But you're gonna survive.

1421
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,290
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?

1422
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,603
<i>So, you see, it was a setup.</i>

1423
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,486
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.

1424
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,369
Still sounds a little
unbelievable, don't you think?

1425
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,124
Unbelievable.
But it's the truth.

1426
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,123
Yeah. My line of work,
you gotta prove the truth.

1427
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,044
And you prove it
with facts and findings.

1428
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,124
Fact is, we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.

1429
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,089
Yeah, because they
wiped the place clean.

1430
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,282
<i>And we have the DVDs
of all your sexual exploits,</i>

1431
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,044
<i>with your prints all over them.</i>

1432
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,885
Luke made those DVDs. I never even
saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.

1433
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,962
Yeah. But we got no DVDs
of your friends.

1434
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,005
<i>No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.</i>

1435
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,208
No DVDs of Chris' girlfriend.
Alright?

1436
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,123
Facts and findings,
Mr. Stevens.

1437
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,090
And we got no evidence
that you were being set up.

1438
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,047
Alright. Is there anything
we've forgotten?

1439
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,849
Yeah. To follow
the fuckin' plan.

1440
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,921
Why didn't you just
handcuff her?

1441
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,405
She was already dead.

1442
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,084
That's still no reason
to mutilate her.

1443
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,731
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.

1444
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,451
Yeah. Well, you better hope your
dramatics don't put us in jail.

1445
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,606
Look. Just lean on 'em
a little bit.

1446
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,409
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke, too.

1447
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,403
Look. Don't tell me how to
do my work. Alright?

1448
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,560
We've questioned them all.

1449
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,250
I got no reason
to believe they've been lying.

1450
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,004
Plus, all your friends
have alibis.

1451
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,248
Alibis? Not for this morning,
they don't.

1452
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,842
<i>We got Luke Seacord and
Chris Vanowen together at breakfast.</i>

1453
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,928
<i>We got Marty Landry
at his office. Alright?</i>

1454
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,604
<i>At his office?</i>

1455
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,568
Look, for at least an hour this
morning, we were all in the loft.

1456
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,364
So was Phil.
What about Phil?

1457
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,807
Actually, he's downstairs right
now with his father-in-law.

1458
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,961
Fry?

1459
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,451
What the fuck's Fry doing here?

1460
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,521
He just gave a statement,

1461
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,887
saying that he was with
his son-in-law all day.

1462
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,048
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!

1463
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,121
And why would he lie?

1464
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,043
Hiram Fry brings
a lot of credibility.

1465
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,523
"Credibility"? I saw Fry in
San Diego with some bimbo!

1466
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,280
<i>Okay? Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry</i>

1467
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,488
<i>into giving me
a waterfront contract.</i>

1468
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,040
So you tried to
blackmail Hiram Fry?

1469
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,804
Mr. Stevens,
enough of this crap.

1470
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,724
We got your prints all over the DVDs,
we got 'em all over the knife.

1471
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,571
We got you chained next to the
dead girl on the bed. Alright?

1472
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,849
Call your lawyer, make a
confession and save your ass!

1473
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,967
You're free to go.

1474
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,971
I want to thank you
for your cooperation.

1475
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,725
You understand we had to check
out your friend's story.

1476
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,802
Of course. It's your job.

1477
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,247
There's just...

1478
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,969
There's one thing
that's bothering me.

1479
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,123
Why does Vincent Stevens keep
accusing his best friends?

1480
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,009
I don't know.
It bothers me, too.

1481
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,041
Hmm.

1482
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,530
Could it be, I just wonder,

1483
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,203
do you think he's trying
to hide something else?

1484
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,766
What would he be hiding?

1485
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,010
Sarah Deakins' murder.

1486
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,966
Murder?

1487
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,042
The detective in the interrogation
called it a suicide.

1488
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,645
Well, that's what
it looked like.

1489
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,400
But the autopsy report revealed that
sleeping pills didn't kill her.

1490
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,970
And her wrist was cut,
but not by Sarah.

1491
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,123
Hesitation marks,
those tentative attempts...

1492
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,601
The first ones before a suicide
actually slashes through an artery.

1493
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,250
The coroner didn't find
those on her.

1494
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,449
But Vincent, he would never...

1495
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,165
His prints are on the knife.

1496
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,085
We didn't find a suicide note.

1497
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,885
Is there something wrong?

1498
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,682
<i>We didn't find a suicide note.</i>

1499
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,365
<i>You have the
suicide note, right?</i>

1500
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,521
<i>I got it.</i>

1501
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,606
Luke.

1502
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,725
Chris. You scared me.

1503
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,641
Sure it's smart, meeting here?

1504
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,764
I think we have a problem, Luke.

1505
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,967
How so?

1506
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,603
Where's Sarah's suicide note?

1507
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,960
You put it in your pocket.

1508
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,280
Yeah, I could've sworn I did,
but it's not there anymore.

1509
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,601
So when did you steal it
from my coat?

1510
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,486
When the doorbell rang
this morning?

1511
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,289
Surprise visit from the realtor?

1512
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,811
Chris, it's...

1513
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,731
It's unfortunate that you
lost Sarah's suicide note,

1514
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,087
but I had nothing
to do with that.

1515
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,360
I called the agency to ask
who put our loft up for sale.

1516
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,442
All they could give me
was a number.

1517
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,608
I did call them. I wanted...

1518
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,530
I thought maybe that...

1519
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,326
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.

1520
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,044
We got nothing
to worry about now.

1521
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,690
But Why'd that note disappear?

1522
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,249
The only real proof
of her suicide.

1523
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,200
Hello?

1524
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,282
Says she's got an appointment
with someone named Sarah Deakins.

1525
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,850
Who's Sarah Deakins?

1526
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,289
Is it because maybe
she didn't write it?

1527
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,885
Maybe it's your handwriting.

1528
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,962
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw...

1529
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,166
Yeah, I saw.

1530
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,969
All the DVDs that
made everybody crazy

1531
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,960
went right along with your
grand plan, didn't it?

1532
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,841
But why, Luke?

1533
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,684
What did you do to that girl?

1534
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,243
Did she get in your way,
between you and Vincent?

1535
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,090
Actually, it was Vincent

1536
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,729
standing between us.

1537
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,765
Is there someone else?

1538
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,167
<i>I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.</i>

1539
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,610
Sarah, wait!

1540
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,609
Forget Vincent. He is
better at games than you.

1541
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,728
Always was, always will be.

1542
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,289
He's hurting you, using you.

1543
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,645
Why are you telling me this?

1544
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,406
I'm telling you,
because I'd never hurt you.

1545
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,250
If you'd just give me
the chance.

1546
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,329
To show I'd never hurt you.

1547
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,048
That's right,
you'd never hurt me.

1548
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,770
Because I feel
nothing for you, Luke.

1549
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,566
I'm sorry.

1550
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,169
Maybe in another life.

1551
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,401
You were here last night.

1552
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,925
Barbara was off skiing.

1553
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,208
So I figured I'd find
Vincent here, with Sarah.

1554
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,006
I'm sorry.

1555
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,211
<i>I waited till he left.</i>

1556
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,009
<i>She said I was right about Vincent.</i>

1557
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,850
<i>Consoling.</i>

1558
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,685
I've gotten so good at it.

1559
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,327
I gave her an insulin OD.

1560
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,848
It's quick. Painless.

1561
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,526
Leaves no trace.

1562
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,209
Jesus, Luke.

1563
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,083
<i>I did it out of love.</i>

1564
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,807
<i>I swear.</i>

1565
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,562
And Vincent taking
the fall for this?

1566
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,291
That's okay with you?

1567
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,369
Vincent used
everyone and anyone!

1568
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,681
It's about time
we turned the tables!

1569
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,330
Well, he's being charged
with murder.

1570
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,801
Yeah.

1571
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,811
Sarah wasn't dead
when we left her with Philip.

1572
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,801
No.

1573
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,846
No. You're lying.

1574
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,287
No.

1575
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,490
That's not possible.

1576
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,123
What Philip did to her

1577
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,770
was sick!

1578
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,520
You're sick, Luke.

1579
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,963
But, if I'm hearing you right,

1580
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,250
it was your brother

1581
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,161
who killed Sarah.

1582
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,721
Okay, Chris.

1583
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,326
Go home.

1584
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,731
I'll clean up.

1585
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,131
Like always.

1586
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,326
No.

1587
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,970
No more cleaning up, Luke.

1588
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,127
Step outside.

1589
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,925
Luke.
Now.

1590
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,561
Jesus. Let me help you, Luke.
Please!

1591
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,331
You're gonna kill me, too?

1592
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,686
It's your own fault.

1593
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,851
What do you want me to do?
Jump?

1594
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,923
Yes. If you don't mind.

1595
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,400
Luke, you don't need to do this.

1596
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,001
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Will you stop it?

1597
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,851
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.

1598
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,361
I really don't.

1599
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,761
So just do it.

1600
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,241
Now!

1601
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,522
I called the cops before I came.

1602
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,365
I told them everything.

1603
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,841
Bullshit. I know you better.

1604
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,206
I thought I knew you.

1605
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,445
What about the note, huh?

1606
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,809
You want this to
go down with me, too?

1607
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,006
Give me that note, Chris.

1608
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,166
Give it to me!

1609
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,806
It's over, Luke.

1610
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,926
You're right.

1611
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,771
It is over.

1612
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,569
Tell Ellie and the kids

1613
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,321
I'm sorry.

1614
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,400
Would you do that for me, Chris?

1615
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,441
No.

1616
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,046
Come on, Chris.

1617
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,367
Be a friend.

1618
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,849
Luke? Luke!

1619
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,610
Luke! Luke!

1620
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,890
They're married. MIMI: Honey, no.
They're having an affair.

1621
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,086
Because she's
laughing at his jokes?

1622
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,970
No. I'm telling you
they're having an affair.

1623
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,486
Since when are you
the big expert on affairs?

1624
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,721
Really?

1625
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,725
Thanks for taking
me back, Meems.

1626
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,206
What was my alternative?

1627
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,526
To leave you wailing
at the front door,

1628
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,449
with snot pouring out of your nose?

1629
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,843
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you off.

1630
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,843
I have the kids early
tomorrow, so I gotta go.

1631
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,281
You're gonna leave me here
alone with my wife?

1632
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,249
Yes. We could at least
have one more drink.

1633
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,560
There'll be plenty more drinks.
Good night, Meems.

1634
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,840
Good night, Chris.

1635
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,486
Chris?

1636
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,561
Anne.

1637
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,007
Hi.

1638
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,647
Hi.

1639
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,050
You look good.

1640
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,050
Thank you. You, too.

1641
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,802
Listen. I still have a key.

1642
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,771
Do you want it back?

1643
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,487
It wouldn't work anymore.

1644
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,645
Vincent's living there
alone now.

1645
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,162
It's the only thing
his wife let him keep.

1646
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,166
And Philip?

1647
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,244
He's awaiting trial.

1648
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,971
We'll see.

1649
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,000
And you?

1650
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,601
Are you doing okay?

1651
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,808
Yeah. Most of the time.

1652
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,530
And the rest of the time?

1653
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,720
I heard you ditched
the city councilman.

1654
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,930
That's not all I've given up.

1655
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,167
Uh, do you wanna grab
a cup of coffee?

1656
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:56,960
