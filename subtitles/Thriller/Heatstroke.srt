1
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,046
Look. Somebody's pulling down the shades.

2
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,152
That's no shade, Spinner. That's an eye lid.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,687
Something huge is looking at us with
that monstrous eye.

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,321
What do you think it is?

5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,984
I don't know, but we're going to find out.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,860
(HEATSTROKE)

7
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,457
Okay. Give us another pose. There you go.
Ah, that's sexy. Right there.

8
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:42,363
Hold it. Ah, that's great. Hold it. Hold it.

9
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:47,830
Nice. Ooh, that's hot. Oh, right there.

10
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,534
Okay, good. Okay,

11
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,677
this time, Brooke, I want you to kneel.

12
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,305
That's looking good.

13
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,709
Can I go to the bathroom?

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh. Can you just hang on a sec?

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,818
We gotta get his shot.
We're running way behind.

16
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,015
What do you think it is?

17
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,089
I don't know, but we're going to find out.

18
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,424
EchoTango One, this is O'Bannon.
I've got a problem. EchoTango One, come in.

19
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,844
EchoTango One, respond.

20
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,813
Where the hell are you guys?
Mayday, MMayday.

21
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,882
AlphaBravo to EchoTango One,
I'm going down.

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,712
Repeat, I'm going down.

23
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,685
Heads up:. Hey:. Watch out!

24
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,487
What's that idiot think he's doing?

25
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,858
Hey, watch out! Hey! Hey, get out of the way!
MMove!

26
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:53,630
Go!

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,924
What the hell's he doing?

28
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,482
Man, that was close. That's it. I'm done.

29
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,420
Is everybody okay?
MMan, what was he thinking? God.

30
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,052
What kind of crazy stunt was that?
You could have killed us.

31
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,818
What are you talking about? Everybody's fine.

32
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,361
Oh, my God. The hair, the makeup, it's ruined.

33
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,329
I didn't mean to
Trying to get a closer look, huh?

34
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,228
Look what you did.

35
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,734
EchoTango One, EchoTango One.
This is O'Bannon over.

36
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,564
Stupid paparazzi.

37
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,834
Paparazzi? You think I look like
a photographer?

38
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,375
Just a pervert then, huh? Peeping Tom?

39
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,410
LoLook, I'm sure this is great whatever
you have going on here, but.

40
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,343
Photo shoot.

41
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,040
Photo shoot.
But I really have important things that.

42
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,119
No, no, you cannot just crash into people and
expect to take no responsibility for it whatsoever.

43
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,853
If you just let me go NNo!

44
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,024
No? No.

45
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,355
I really don't have time for this.

46
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,053
You have to deal with this.

47
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,962
Maleko, stop him.

48
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,698
Hold up, pal. You're not going anywhere.

49
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,339
Don't.

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,732
You know I tried to be nice.

51
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,944
You son of a bitch.

52
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,147
Maleko. He's out cold.

53
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,545
Are you crazy?

54
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,482
Most days.

55
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,069
(Special Ops HQ Pearl Harbor, Hawaii)

56
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,530
Major Wozniak. Wait.

57
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,829
Get the hell out of my way.

58
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,131
You're not answering my calls.

59
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,935
Oh, we don't have anything to talk about,
Dr. Taggart.

60
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,840
You think that for thirty years Earth's
been inhabited by space aliens.

61
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,309
And I think you're crazy.

62
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,144
NNo, I'm sane. You're blind. Open your eyes.

63
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,374
I have. It's crap.

64
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,882
It's not crap. Look again.

65
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,785
1975 we detect traces of a new form

of radiation.

66
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,050
All over the globe.

67
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,251
Unique wavelengths we can't replicate.

68
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,489
We name it Tau Seven.
What causes it, we still don't know.

69
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,563
And I still don't care. Well, you should.

70
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:19,433
Also in 1 975, huge spike in insomnia cases.
Thousands worldwide.

71
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,698
Identical nightmares about aliens.

72
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,004
So what? File it with all the other alien
and UFO abduction claims.

73
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:31,182
This is different. These people were driven
insane. Blackouts, breakdowns, psychoses.

74
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,213
Like Captain O'Bannon?

75
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,010
Oh, O'Bannon's a good man. He is dri.

76
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,917
He's a screwup and you put him in charge of
a Gatecrash search team.

77
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,819
And now you expect me to take you seriously?

78
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,118
I expect you to take the facts seriously.

79
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,264
Look. Altered migration patterns.
Random telephone disruptions.

80
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,000
When did it all start? 1 975, every one.

81
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,000
Means nothing.
You don't have a scrap of tangible proof.

82
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,634
Then give us more time.

83
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:04,407
Major Wozniak, finding extraterrestrials would
be the greatest discovery mankind has ever made.

84
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,515
I don't give a rat's ass about great discoveries,
Doctor.

85
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,450
My job's national security,
not chasing down E.T.'s.

86
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,851
Can you imagine
if the media finds out about this?

87
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,724
For six years we've been wasting Special
Op's forces looking for little green men.

88
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,898
They'd lock us all in rubber rooms.
NNot gonna happen.

89
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:23,760
NNow, go away.

90
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,370
You know what? You're not done with me yet.
The hell I'm not.

91
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:36,444
So this is island number what?
Thirty? I've lost track.

92
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,574
You know what? This one's promising.

93
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,150
Only two days here and we've already
logged the highest Tau Seven readings yet.

94
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,881
I'm just bored out of my skull, babe.

95
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,059
You say that everywhere we go.

96
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,354
NNo, no, no, not Afghanistan.
I liked Afghanistan.

97
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,825
It wasn't boring, that's for sure.
NNo, it was not boring.

98
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,226
You said it would be a bad place for
a honeymoon. What were you thinking?

99
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,026
What was I thinking? I don't know.

100
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,830
I don't either. I know what I'm thinking.

101
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,767
Oh? Let's go.

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,103
05 cover?

103
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,175
Blue and gold bikini. Flawless.

104
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:13,680
And the '04 Kenya shoot in the
onepiece black. Perfection.

105
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,245
It's a huge honor to meet both of you ladies.

106
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,261
Oy, Barman. The horse that peed
in this must have had a fever.

107
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,699
You got any beer that's not boiling?

108
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,037
Okay. You gotta have ice, don't you?

109
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,736
No ice.

110
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,575
I, I, I just need moe time.

111
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,412
YYeah, we had a couple of delays,
but it was out of my control.

112
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:50,846
NNo, no, no. NNo, no. And I appreciate that.

113
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,655
Adam, listen. This thing tanks
and we're both kinda screwed, right?

114
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:01,425
Can you at least try?
Call me back as soon as you can.

115
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,837
Oh, jeez. What now? NNothing.

116
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,532
Oh. Good.

117
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,636
What?

118
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,848
I just wanna let you know what you did.
What I did?

119
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,780
At the beach. Oh, jeez.

120
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,753
NNo, no. Look, this job was a big opportunity
for me.

121
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,685
Chance to make decisions,

new responsibilities.

122
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,356
It was a big deal for me.

123
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,459
And I'm sure you didn't plan to ruin
my photo shoot, but that's exactly what you did.

124
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,063
Now, now wait a minute. I'm not finished.

125
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,266
Okay.

126
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,728
I'm sure what you're doing here
is very important.

127
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,439
But what I'm doing was important, too. To me.

128
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:46,007
What are you talking about? What did I
cost you, fifteen minutes with my interruption?

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,042
NNow, why don't you just get your girls
and your cameras and get back out there.

130
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,408
Can't. Why not?

131
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,786
They're trying to fix the camera,
but she's seen better days.

132
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,051
I knew you couldn't make it right.
An apology would have been nice.

133
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,423
Hey, wait. Le's start over.
Let me get you a drink.

134
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
No, thanks.

135
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,430
You making friends over there?

136
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,035
That's me. Mr. Popularity.

137
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,529
Hey. You okay?

138
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,001
NNever better. I trashed the ultralight.

139
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,537
What? How the hell did you do that?

140
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,537
Another blackout?

141
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,767
I was pushing it. We're running out of time.

142
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,009
They're definitely gonna pull the plug
on us now.

143
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,647
Count on it. Can't blame 'em.
We came up empty.

144
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,780
The way I see it, that's a good thing. Isn't it?

145
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,452
Unless they are out there
and we just didn't find them.

146
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,789
I need a beer. You want? Yeah.

147
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,486
Can I have two beers, please?

148
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,364
No beers.

149
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,928
And no exit.

150
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,834
Come on, guys. Too hot for this macho crap.

151
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,383
I am out of here.

152
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,553
Come on back. They'll be done in a second.

153
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,561
Get up. Grab him.

154
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,136
Heads!

155
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,554
Could have used a small one.
That was a small one.

156
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,915
Thanks for jumping in, pal.

157
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,651
Didn't know you needed help, Cap.

158
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,261
Thanks a lot, man. I had 'em already to party.

159
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,693
Back to work. Yes, sir.

160
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,976
This is one chewedup flight recorder.

161
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,917
Salvage all you can.

162
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,583
How the helI'd you do that?

163
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,718
I was a little too low.
I must have clipped a tree.

164
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,222
Why didn't you send up the drone?

165
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,854
I'll fix it. Get off my back.

166
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,190
This thing's trashed.

167
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,558
EchoTango One. Captain O'Bannon speaking.

168
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,698
It'll be a miracle to recover any data.

169
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:24,961
Then I want a miracle.

170
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,335
Yes, sir. Coming right up, sir.

171
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,770
Roger. Copy all. O'Bannon out.

172
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,243
So, what's up?

173
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,905
Gatecrash a nogo. Pulled the plug.

174
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,312
Where you goin? Get back to work.

175
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,036
Here's to Gatecrash. Gatecrash.

176
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,882
You never really thought we'd find anything,
did ya?

177
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,286
Why'd you sign on?

178
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,448
Wanted something different.

179
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,692
Boring's different.

180
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,729
And because you asked.

181
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,066
So, what are you gonna do now? Retire?

182
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:41,137
Yeah. Buy a farm. Grow grapes. Make wine.

183
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,242
Make babies.

184
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,083
Jill doesn't know about that last part yet.

185
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,486
What are you gonna do?

186
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,497
You know, once you're stateside,

187
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,272
maybe you should see someone.

188
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,940
Been seeing a shrink since I was ten years old.

189
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,170
You gotta do something, man.
Blacking out, flying into a tree.

190
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,639
NNot too healthy.

191
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,751
Yeah. If that's what happened.

192
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,591
What the hell is this?

193
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,430
Let me see.

194
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,748
Looks organic. Looks what?

195
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,819
I'm gonna run a scan on it.

196
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,175
Come on. We owe this guy.

197
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,708
You sure this is a good idea?

198
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,890
Steve. This was inside the data recorder.

199
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,393
A claw?

200
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,401
It's hot. Tau Seven.

201
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,140
Run it's DNA. Then recheck that hard drive,

202
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,809
swab it down, every square inch,

203
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,734
see if we can pick anything else up.

204
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,104
You got it.

205
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,914
You are out there.

206
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,814
I'm gonna put the fear of God
in that son of a bitch. Give me the rifle.

207
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:22,373
Hey. Yeah. You're not a paparazzi.
You're military.

208
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,597
Did you walk here?

209
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,103
Hey, let me, let me, let me help.

210
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,142
No, uh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

211
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,214
Are you a military, too?

212
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,610
NNo. I'm a model trying desperately to get
to the other side of the camera.

213
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,448
And this is my big chance.

214
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,318
I mean, it took me two years to convince
these people to let me manage my own shoot.

215
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,118
And you fly in and break the camera?

216
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,919
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

217
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,923
You have to make this right.

218
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:46,961
How am I gonna do that?

219
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:51,101
Have Uncle Sam reimburse me for
the broken equipment, the lost time.

220
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,596
My uncle's cheap.
I don't think he's gonna write you a check.

221
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,431
Well, then cash, cash is fine.

222
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,404
Don't you coMander types carry tons
of money for emergencies?

223
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,478
Where'd you see that? CNNNN?

224
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,746
So you're not gonna help me.

225
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,450
Hey, I don't know. I got about twentytwo bucks
in my wallet. You're welcome to that.

226
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,017
Hey. Just, why don't you at least let me
give you a ride home?

227
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,648
It's definitely organic.

228
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,075
I was sure I had it wrong.

229
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,221
I ran it six times, but it's not wrong.

230
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,754
Cells from the claw,

the genetic material is not DNNA.

231
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,823
Totally different nucleotides.

232
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,321
It's real. Real what?

233
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,261
Evidence. NNothing on the planet has a
biochemistry like this.

234
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,664
What, we found ourselves a piece E.T.?

235
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,542
Steve, this is amazing. It's ridiculous.

236
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,775
Ridiculous? You don't believe us.

237
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,052
I don't believe the timing.
You're just trying to save your jobs.

238
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,450
We wouldn't make it up, Major.

239
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,257
NNo, Steve, it's all right.

240
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,227
That's absurd. This is no hoax.

241
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,727
Well, then they're misreading their data.
They're just seeing what they want to see.

242
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,128
No. Believe me, I didn't want to see what I saw.

243
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,769
Because my faith says it's impossible.

244
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:33,632
Your what?

245
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,366
I believe God made man in his own image.

246
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,442
And his gift of life to Earth is unique.

247
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,873
Alien life can't exist.

248
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,174
But we found it.

249
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,648
And now I have to accept it.

250
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,012
Stand by.

251
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,354
You didn't have to keep it a secret.

252
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,592
I wasn't sure you wanted someone around
with the Good Book in her pocket.

253
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,495
A Jesus freak now believes in spacemen.

254
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,966
Hallelujah. Must be true.

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,764
You be Scully, I'll be Mulder.

256
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,009
You wanted evidence, you've got it.

257
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,678
A couple of weird cells doesn't mean
we've got Martians running around.

258
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,780
I'm telling you, this is a breakthrough.

259
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,040
Can you imagine the media response?

260
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,550
If I'm right, and you were too pigheaded
to go check it out?

261
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,154
Gatecrash is a mile above top secret.

262
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,984
You go public, I'll skin you alive.

263
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,820
You mess this up, you'll get fed to the wolves.

264
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,792
So why risk it? Let's go see what they've got.

265
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,007
Morning.

266
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,975
Mornin', Sheriff.

267
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,241
I don't like Sheriff. Call me Angel.

268
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,755
NNo wiseass comments, no funny face.

269
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,416
Maybe we'll get along, Mister?

270
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,186
O'Bannon. Steve.

271
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,554
What's your rank, Steve?

272
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,864
Maybe we won't get along.

273
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,363
I could toss your ass in jail
for busting up that bar.

274
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,568
Selfdefense.

275
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,398
Tell it to the judge.
You have the right to remain silent.

276
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,572
You have the right to an attorney.

277
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,843
My rank's Captain, Sheriff.

278
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,569
So, Captain. Your buddies with the bats.

279
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:23,813
When'd you see 'em last?

280
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,175
In the bar. Why?

281
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,145
Gone. Missing.

282
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,042
I don't know anything about it.

283
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,485
What's a Special Ops team doing here?

284
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,449
Looking for Osama.

285
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,250
Ah, Captain. Me no dumb local savage.

286
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,486
Me all the time talk, talk pretty good.

287
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,823
Me study criminology at UCLA.

288
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,470
Okay. Here's the truth. I lead a special detail
that's been sent here to find extraterrestrial life.

289
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,834
So? Why didn't you say so?

290
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,668
Why do I bother?

291
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,578
Look, Captain. If I wanted to hear crap
about space aliens, I'd talk to my grandma.

292
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,749
Why, has she seen 'em?

293
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,545
Oh, yeah. She sees 'em all the time
on the T set.

294
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,449
They watch her. Keep her awake at nights.

295
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,989
Maybe you'd like to talk to her.

296
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,391
Yeah, I would.

297
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,160
Don't yank my chain.

298
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,989
Uncle Sam better vouch for you

299
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,358
or we're not gonna be friends. Hear me?

300
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,760
Loud and clear.

301
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,674
Al and Jill. You start at HQ and head south.

302
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,711
Romeo, go east. I'm going north.

303
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,280
Mental, scan wide with the drone. Al.

304
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,485
Al, any Tau Seven reading yet? Over.

305
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,014
Says onepointfour here, Steve,
and it's getting stronger.

306
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,622
Stay on it. Out.

307
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,694
Ultralight picked up a hot spot somewhere
north of here, but couldn't lock down its position.

308
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,464
O'Bannon to Romeo. I need a temp wrap.
Over.

309
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,564
O'Bannon to Romeo. Check in.
What've you got? Over.

310
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:02,669
Uh, Romeo here. Still nothing.
Tau Seven level is pointzerothree.

311
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,949
Bloody amazing.
A real live E.T. could be out here

312
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,014
and we could make the first contact.
What do we say to it?

313
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,615
Well, I don't imagine an alien life
form's gonna speak English.

314
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,258
NNow, just go with me here.
What's the first thing you'd ask him?

315
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,392
How you say cold beer in alien?

316
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,103
How're you holding up?

317
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,801
I keep telling myself,
God does everything for a reason.

318
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,805
All creatures great and small.

319
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,682
ven creatures from other worlds.

320
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,545
I still can't get my head around it.

321
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,946
It's a mindblower.

322
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,682
Yeah. And we found it.
Something to tell our kids about.

323
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,292
Oh, kids. What, you know something I don't?

324
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,692
Sir, no, sir. Purely hypothetical.

325
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,792
We don't need to reopen the
children discussion. Do we?

326
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,660
Unless you want to.

327
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,074
Hey, Jill. Aliens were here.

328
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,410
Partying.

329
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,457
What have we got here?

330
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,491
Relax, tough guy. It's dead.

331
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,597
Alfeaten.

332
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,499
That's one big ugly bug.

333
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,028
And radioactive.

334
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,044
Hmm, what do you do, Lieutenant?
I hunt down Martians.

335
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,379
Oh, really? Hmm, that's so cool.

336
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:56,089
Well, actually, I chase itsybitsy traces
of weird radiation.

337
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,421
You bet. It's a rush.

338
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,602
Here we go. Bird's up.

339
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,743
Scanning for Tau Seven and finding bugger all.

340
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,847
Bird's not seeing any Tau Seven.

341
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,239
You sure you fixed it?

342
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,214
Widen your search.
That hotspot didn't just disappear.

343
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,786
Captain? Romeo here. Still nothing.

344
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,785
Tau Seven max is zeropointtwo.

345
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,282
And I'm running out of road.

346
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,218
Double back to the beach.

347
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,894
Get the ultralight. Out.
Oh, man. Check this out.

348
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,064
Civilization at its finest.

349
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,790
NNo fridge and no toilet,
but by God they got a television.

350
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,033
Zoom in. Something's moving.

351
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,937
It's either an alien or Mrs. Big Foot.
That's Grandma.

352
00:25:56,354 --> 00:26:00,120
Stop! Stop. Stop!

353
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,519
What's the problem?
We heard something coming at us.

354
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,322
Where? Show me.

355
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,262
Come on. NNothing's gonna hurt you. Come on.

356
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,885
Hey. You lost?

357
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,852
I'm good. Just picking locations.

358
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,319
And we're gonna finish the shoot
with a new photographer.

359
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,188
You know, I was thinking about your pictures.

360
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:45,202
And there's a great little island
about eight miles west of here. Isolated.

361
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,232
You could charter over. It's beautiful.

362
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,337
You wanna get rid of me?
Just trying to be helpful.

363
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,404
Why?

364
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,704
How well do you know that, uh, bartender?

365
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,970
You know, your beach security guy.

366
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,706
Hardly. He was a day hire. He's missing.

367
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,914
What are you military guys up to?

368
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,487
Military? I'm just a tourist, ma'am.

369
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,850
Yeah, and I'm blonde.

370
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:13,424
About yesterday. The, uh, I was, uh. I'm sorry.

371
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,693
Thank you.

372
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,297
Why are you here?

373
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,038
I can't tell you.

374
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,279
Should I be afraid of this place?

375
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:33,382
I was you, I'd find another place
for my photo shoot.

376
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,387
Soon as you can.

377
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,825
What'd it look like?

378
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,564
We didn't see anything.
We just heard it. It, it sort of chattered.

379
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:58,167
It's gone now. It's probably just a parrot
or something.

380
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,277
Hey, how come you guys are out hiking?
NNo work today?

381
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,643
Oh, we're waiting on a photographer.
The other one left.

382
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,480
And he left you ladies behind. What, is he gay?

383
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,182
What's that?

384
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,126
NNo, it's cool. It's, it's just a bird
or something.

385
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,930
You sure?

386
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,563
Of course.

387
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,688
You wanna lift back to town?

388
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,563
There is no way you are leaving us here alone.

389
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,262
Climb in. I gotta make one stop first.

390
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,543
There. Let's do that again. Here we go. Ooh.

391
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,855
Hello? Hello?

392
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,663
Go. Leave now.

393
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,164
Hang on. Hey, wait. I'm a friend of Angel's.

394
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,767
You know my little Angel?

395
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,631
Yeah, you're his grandmother, right?

396
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,771
Rahela.

397
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,568
Rahela. I'm Steve. Can I talk to you?

398
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,204
Talk what?

399
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,541
NNightmares. Bad dreams.

400
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,943
Television.

401
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,799
I'll be right back.

402
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,604
Romeo here. I, I don't see an ultralight.
Maybe it washed out to sea.

403
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,246
Keep looking and scanning for Tau Seven.
Over.

404
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,642
What's the point? It's gone.

405
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,477
Or maybe you crashed somewhere else
and I'm in the wrong area, sir.

406
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,417
I know where I crashed, Lieutenant.

Stay in that sector. Out.

407
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,454
Yes, sir. Roger that.

408
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:05,326
This is gonna take awhile.
You guys might wanna go take a dip.

409
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,627
What's that?

410
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,099
Don't ask.

411
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,942
Basically it's a huge waste of time
and taxpayer money.

412
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,908
Uh, um, just don't ask.

413
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:35,523
Rahela, Rahela. Tell me about the red eyes.

414
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,490
They watch. I watch. I see them.

415
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,489
Where do you see them?

416
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,790
Dreams. They see in the dreams.

417
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,058
Where else do you see them?

418
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,466
T. Pictures scared me. Off.

419
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,696
Fire and smoke. Volcano.

420
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,674
There's a face. A face. Fire and smoke.

421
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,541
Black sound. Snake hiss. Like water.

422
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,408
Oh. Red eyes. Red eyes.

423
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,180
That's okay. That's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Don't look at it. Sh. Sh.

424
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,584
That's enough, Captain. Outside.

425
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,358
What's the problem? We're just talking.

426
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,964
Talk to me. She's confused.
Doesn't need visitors.

427
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,294
Angel. Do you have dreams? What?

428
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,668
NNightmares, bad ones that keep you up at night.

429
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,703
No, no. We talk.

430
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,374
She has the same dreams.

431
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,008
Grandma. Go back inside. Please.

432
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,112
The dreams. He knows. He sees.

433
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,575
It's a recurring nightmare.

434
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,249
She has it. I have it. A lot of people have it.

435
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,410
Started years ago for me.
I saw this thing on a TV set. Red eyes glowing.

436
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,250
This. This watches. The dream face.

437
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,153
I remember. Red eyes. Red eyes.

438
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,955
But glowing red eyes.
But, but, but, they're just dreams, right?

439
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,862
Red eyes.

440
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,796
You're serious. You're looking for aliens.

441
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,006
This island's an entomologist's dream.

442
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:09,478
That thing's not alien, right?

443
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,951
They seem to be Earth insects. Just bigger.

444
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,384
Any Tau Seven here?
NNo, nothing to write home about.

445
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,527
This is Waters, Sector Two's done.

Where to next?

446
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,688
Romeo's at the beach looking for the ultralight.

447
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:22,990
Maybe you need to hang.

448
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,859
He better not be working on his tan.

449
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,268
I'll have a look.

450
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,061
Romeo. Yeah.

451
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,042
Hell with this.

452
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,494
Calling Romeo. Come in, Romeo.
Where art thou, Romeo?

453
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,866
Calling Romeo. Come in, Romeo.

454
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,091
Incoming.

455
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,232
People dream about red eyes so aliens exist?
I don't buy that.

456
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,841
I don't blame you. When did her dreams start?

457
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,273
I was eight. Volcano eruption.
First time in centuries.

458
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,312
One night her mind snapped. 1975.

459
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,743
1975? Has the island always been this hot?

460
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,780
Hotter since the eruption.

461
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,689
What about the bugs?

462
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,128
Get bigger every year. Figured it was the heat.

463
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,595
I swear it's the truth. NNo way.

464
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,852
Jesus, come on! Hurry!

465
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,629
Get outta here!

466
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,784
Run! Run! Run!

467
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,408
Gotcha.

468
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,046
Got an explosion at the beach.
I can't raise Romeo.

469
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,584
Everybody, we got a problem.

470
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,286
I'm heading for the beach. Al, you copy? Over.

471
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,553
Copy that, Steve. We're almost there.

472
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,794
Romeo!

473
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,600
Check the beach. Move.

474
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,569
Romeo. Romeo!

475
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,279
Civilian down!

476
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,809
What have we got? Romeo's MIA.

477
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,543
Do a hasty search, hundred meters.

478
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,592
Got another one, Steve.

479
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,265
Confirmed casualty.

480
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,671
Mental, take it down to treetop level.
I need a oneclick coverage of my position.

481
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,676
And what the hell am I looking for?
Large, fastmoving animal.

482
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,943
Romeo? Missing.

483
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,923
My God. What the hell are you doing here?

484
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,131
We were leaving. We were leaving.

485
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:54,771
I was trying to find them. Where's Brooke?
Missing.

486
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,008
Oh, my God. Who's doing this?
What's going on?

487
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,605
You know. You know what's going on.
Tell me, what the hell happened?

488
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,475
Your friends were attacked. By who?

489
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,650
We don't know.

490
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,442
I've got something. It's heading northeast.

491
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,620
Can't get a clear visual, but it's on the move.

492
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,187
Take the coast road. Maintain radio contact.
Got it.

493
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,985
Take this vehicle, go north. Move it.

494
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,255
Wait, that, that's my ca, my car.
You can't take my, my.

495
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,421
You're coming with me.
You can't take my car.

496
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:25,158
Look, I don't have time for this. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Like hell.

497
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:33,105
Yeah, it just hung a ninety.
It's heading northwest. Coming your way.

498
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,788
Jill, do you copy?

499
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:51,894
Yeah, I saw it. It's fast. It looked like,

headed north of the road.

500
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,955
Towards you, Al. Roger that.

501
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,835
Bloody hell. Look at it.

502
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,933
Crap, I lost it.

503
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,873
Mental, you gotta do better than that.

504
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,509
Roger that. It's heading on a bearing
of zerosixzero.

505
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,011
Jill, hold your position. Cut it off. Holding.

506
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,143
Al, head inland. Funnel him towards me.

507
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,316
Roger that.

508
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,890
It's heading towards the crossroads.

509
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,391
Copy. Out. Come on. Let's go.
Come on where?

510
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,128
We have to cut it off.

511
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,889
It. You keep saying it. Is it some kind of animal?

512
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,395
Yeah, yeah. Some kind. Let's go.

513
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,966
Why won't you give me a straight answer?

514
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,502
Look. You think it's possible
there might be life on another planet?

515
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,770
Maybe.

516
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,137
What?

517
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,242
Something's out there.
We don't know what it is.

518
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,573
But it's fast, it's mean and it kills.

519
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,544
And you're safer with me.

520
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,354
Al, he's moving for the cliffs.

521
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,424
Keep heading dead west,
you'll run right into him.

522
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,585
Roger that.

523
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,222
Jill, I'm almost at the crossroads.

524
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,559
Al's heading for the cliffs.
You can turn inland and cut it off.

525
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,734
Roger.

526
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,967
Steve, give us a heads up.

527
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,777
Target's on the road, 00 meters ahead.

528
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,492
Oh, man.

529
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,966
Target just blew threw. See him, Mental?

530
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,196
NNo. I'll widen out. Hang on.

531
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,442
You okay? Yeah. That was it?

532
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,739
Some vertical on that guy.

533
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,149
Come on. Come on now, ugly.

534
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,083
Big fat patch of radiation, 1 00 meters east.

535
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,312
Could be heading that way.

536
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,059
Heading dead west, you'll run right into him.

537
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,067
Yeah, I bet the bugger likes it.
That's Tau Seven's hot tub.

538
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,868
I've got movement. Target!

539
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,910
Tau Seven's spiked off the dials.

540
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,122
Damn it. The bird's fried.

541
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,629
I think I got one.

542
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:03,676
I've got a confirmed kill, Steve. Copy.
Anybody read me?

543
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,770
You guys aren't gonna believe this.

544
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,578
Anybody read me? Anybody.

545
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,303
Al, come in. Al, do you read me?

546
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,637
It's been twenty minutes
and he's still not answering.

547
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:01,976
I can't raise him either.

548
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
Where the hell you been?

549
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,453
I got the son of a bitch.

550
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,696
You gotta be kidding me.

551
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,047
Is it dead? Yeah, it's dead.

552
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,645
Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.

553
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,592
This is a big.

554
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,285
Go back to your hotel, pack your things.
I want you on the next boat off the island.

555
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,488
Don't tell anybody about this.

556
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:59,260
I won't. Steve, good luck.

557
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,307
NNice to meet you.

558
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,390
Are you trying to tell me that thing's an alien?

559
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,860
NNo, no way. It's some kind of practical joke.

560
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,761
This is bloody unbelievable.

561
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,731
Tough hide. Like Kevlar.

562
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,704
Very little insulation underneath.
So they like it hot.

563
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,341
Guess we know why it came here then.

564
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,011
I gotta this figure this thing
killed Maleko and Kala.

565
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,348
How many people on this island?
Couple of hundred.

566
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,446
You thinking evacuation?

567
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,675
Could be more of these bastards out there.

568
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,050
I know there's more.
This one's got all its claws.

569
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,517
Right.Every boat you've got. NNow!

570
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,322
What? Hang on. HHang on, hang on.

571
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,656
Volcano.

572
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,324
Still there? Okay. Don't blab it.

573
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:09,196
We got volcanologists here saying
Palaloa is gonna erupt any minute.

574
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,634
Bigger than '75.

575
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,412
You know what this means.

576
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,082
CNNNN. Leno. Cover of Time."

577
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,717
We're gonna be famous.

578
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,280
Yeah, in about a hundred years
after they declassify it.

579
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,723
NNext island's sending boats
for the evacuations.

580
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,991
Sheriff's rounding up the civilians.

581
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,523
See what it had for breakfast. Must we?

582
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,664
Ah. It liked bugs.

583
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,464
So they didn't come here for
the heat of the Tao Seven, but the chow.

584
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:46,039
It's the island of supersized insects.
Must have been glad they found it.

585
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:46,971
Or the other way around.

586
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,577
The bugs didn't get big 'til they got here.
Same thing with the heat.

587
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,341
The temperature didn't go up unti
I the volcano erupted in '75. NNow, what if...

588
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,312
these bastards made it erupt?

589
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,358
Steve? Steve.

590
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,491
Oh, nothing. I just, I, uh.

591
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,599
So why would they want to turn up the heat?

592
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,601
Maybe to turn this island into their own
private bug farm.

593
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:20,004
They came all the way to Earth just to grow
a few bugs. Makes no sense.

594
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,440
Hey, Jill. Clip me off a piece of that hide,
would ya?

595
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,638
Want a souvenir or something?
Souvenir, my ass.

596
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,545
I gotta find a way to take these bastards down.
All right.

597
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,154
Armorpiercing, Tefloncoating,
maybe a bit of Thermit.

598
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,127
You need anything, babe?
Ham sandwich. I'm starving.

599
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,659
Yeah? Some mustard maybe?
Maybe some guacamole.

600
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,888
Guacamole, yeah. All right.

601
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:04,947
Al. Al?

602
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,042
Rela. You're tense.

603
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,980
Sure. It's not like aliens are invading
Earth or anything.

604
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,814
We'll get 'em. I got one, didn't I?

605
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:44,356
What if there are a hundred more?
Or a thousand? I'm scared, Al.

606
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,305
NNow I'm scared. And I want you.

607
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,804
But that's enough for now.

608
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,247
I gotta get back to work.
Great. NNow I'm tense.

609
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,915
At ease, Captain. I'm on duty.

610
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,771
Here comes the cavalry.

611
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,892
Captain, good to see you.
Where are those cell sample?

612
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,759
Got anything yet?

613
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,496
Oh, yeah. I've got some stuff to show you.

614
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,108
Captain O'Bannon. NNightmares ever clear up?

615
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,572
NNope. NNo, sir.

616
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,309
No, sir.

617
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,347
So, what have you got now? Blurry photos?
Anal probing?

618
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,572
Major, that's uncalled for.

619
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,912
For someone who can't sleep,
you look wellrested.

620
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,519
Enjoying your tropical vacation?

621
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,349
Best vacation I ever had.
Managed to do some hunting.

622
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,526
Wait 'til you see what I bagged, sir.

623
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,863
Lieutenant, take charge.

624
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:34,698
All right, guys. Fall out. Get your gear inside.
Yes, sir.

625
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,337
What's this supposed to be?
Some sort of extraterrestrial?

626
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,374
Oh, it clearly didn't evolve on Earth.

627
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,070
How do you know?
It could be some sort of mutant lizard.

628
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,343
A mutation would have recognizable DNNA.
This doesn't.

629
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,950
Can't have evolved on Earth. Look at it.

630
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,748
Why did you kill it?

631
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,551
It attacked us. It's hostile.
Killed at least three people.

632
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,390
NNo, no, no. It can't be hostile.

It's been here thirtytwo years, hidden.

633
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,461
We didn't provoke it.

634
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,625
Oh, it doesn't matter now.

We have to communicate with them.

635
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,595
You're assuming it's intelligent?
You see any evidence of this?

636
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,608
Language? Technology? We'll do a full recon.

637
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,836
To provoke them further?
To see what we're up against.

638
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,981
NNumbers, deployment, weaponry.

639
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,809
Oh, and then what are you gonna do?
You're gonna start a war?

640
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:25,351
You see any Klingons here?
All I see is one dumb animal with sharp claws.

641
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,581
This dumb animal was fast,

mean and a bitch to bring down.

642
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,225
Yeah, and all the more reason

to evaluate the threat.

643
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:35,228
Moon sets at 0126. We move at 00130.

644
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:52,577
Steve. You awake? Always.

645
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,684
Where was Al going?
He just took off in the Mule. Alone.

646
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,248
Some errand for Wozniak?

647
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,447
Alone? Did you try to radio him?

648
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,318
Yeah. NNo answer.

649
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,661
Go look for him. Take NNaka and Brandt.

650
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:08,922
Right. Thanks.

651
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,067
Yeah. And your Bible.

652
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,675
There's Al Mule. NNaka, you're with me.

653
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,815
Brandt, watch our backs. Roger that.

654
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:33,379
Mule's empty. Motor's still warm.

655
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:41,123
Tracks? Don't see any.

656
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,604
Brandt, secure this area. Copy.

657
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:14,027
Al. Al. Al? Al.

658
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,895
What's going on?

659
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,498
What's going on?

660
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:29,343
Sh. I saw an alien. That noise.

661
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,537
Yeah, you hear it too? It's creepy, huh?

662
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,046
NNo lights!

663
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,811
Al!

664
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,248
What?

665
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,061
You killed him!

666
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:52,325
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

667
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,796
No.

668
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:02,908
Oh, my.

669
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:32,505
All right, gentlemen

670
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,441
Listen up. Simple recon.

671
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,908
Search and rescue. Brandt, NNaka,

Waters

672
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,341
And Grange aren't responding.

673
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,108
We're going after them. Lieutenant,
let's move 'em out.

674
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:45,082
You heard the major. Let's get her done.
Kelly, take us out.

675
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,756
Sir, yes, sir. Let's move out.

676
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,174
All right, let's go. Hasty search.

677
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,281
Man down. We got a man down.

678
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,912
It's Brandt. Dead.

679
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,880
Major, his face. Burnt clean off.

680
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,742
Man down!

681
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,516
NNaka's gone. NNeck's broke.

682
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,949
ound ill. hrist, Medic!

683
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,755
She's alive.

684
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,267
Al. Al! Man down!

685
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:14,102
You all right? You okay? Jill. Where's Jill?

686
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,575
She's alive. She's with the medic.
Oh, thank God.

687
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,685
I saw movement in the perimeter
and I just went for it.

688
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,725
What the hell were you thinking?

689
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,726
I took one of those freaks out, didn't I?

690
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,094
That makes you Superman?
What happened then?

691
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,329
Jill found me.

692
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:46,131
We got ambushed. It just happened so fast.

693
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:55,974
It was all my fault. I should have helped her.

694
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:04,382
I should have taken backup.
Baby, I'm so sorry.

695
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,355
You better pray she makes it.

696
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,030
It's bad. I don't know if she'll make it or not.

697
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,473
You don't say if,
you say when she's gonna wake up.

698
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:31,352
We got plans, don't we, Jill?
I can't do it alone.

699
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,885
I can't do it alone.

700
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,595
What are you doing here?

701
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,403
We missed the last boat.

702
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,542
Grandma wandered off. Took forever
to find her. We're staying with you.

703
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,372
Dream. I remember.

704
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,103
Sun. Sky. Dead tree.
Give it a rest, Grandma. Come on.

705
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,874
Heat. Give it a rest, Grandma. ome on.

706
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,249
Well, you're in for it now.

707
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,253
You'll protect me, right? Oh, yeah.

708
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,292
You can bunk here. I won't be using it.

709
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,436
You're not gonna sleep? NNah.

710
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,035
Rahela told me about your dreams.
She has 'em too, huh?

711
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,142
Yeah, damnedest thing. She's trying to
forget 'em, I'm trying to remember 'em.

712
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,013
When was the last time
you had a decent night's sleep?

713
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,441
I can't remember.

714
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,842
Well, all the comforts of home.

715
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,725
Maybe you've been trying too hard to
remember your dreams.

716
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,495
Some things you can't force, you know.

717
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:00,303
Feels good.

718
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,936
Eyes closed?

719
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:11,584
All right. Open yourself up. Drift with the tide.

720
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:18,655
All that Zen crap. Just float.

721
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,721
It's just looking at us with that monstrous eye.

722
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,123
What do you think it is?

723
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,427
I don't know, but we're going to find out.

724
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,441
Question for you, Taggs.
What if the aliens have a bigger agenda than

725
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,610
just heating up this island and growing a bunch
of big bugs?

726
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:10,836
Such as?

727
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,774
What if they're heating up the whole planet?

728
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,206
What? How?

729
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,975
Take more than a volcano to do that.

730
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,643
NNo, that's geothermal.
Solar energy, the greenhouse effect.

731
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,313
You're saying aliens are the cause
of global warming?

732
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,719
Maybe they made it worse.

733
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,685
What's Tau Seven do to the ozone layer?

734
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,887
I don't know. I'll check.
But, but why heat up Earth?

735
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,098
Push global warming to the extreme.

736
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,999
Our life dies out. Ecosystem collapses.

737
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:43,371
Eventually all that's left are insects.

738
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,152
All right, gentlemen, listen up.
This is what we get paid for.

739
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,378
Where's Sergeant Blatnikoff?

740
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,886
Your watch stop, Sergeant?

741
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,527
NNo, I hocked it in Capetown. Here.

742
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,691
I added mercury cores
and handloaded the casings.

743
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,229
These will punch through that hide.

744
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,128
We've only got five per customer.
Use 'em wisely.

745
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,601
Give 'em a couple of hours,
we could have a bunch more, sir.

746
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,274
Captain, that's more than enough firepower
for a simple recon.

747
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,104
Lieutenant, let's move 'em out.

748
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,044
You heard the Major. Kelly, you're point man.
I'll take deuce.

749
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,878
Let's go. Yes, sir.

750
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,438
Kell, watch yourself, watch yourself.

751
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:49,340
Kelly, go to night vision. Captain.

752
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,143
All clear.

753
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:55,648
All clear, sir. A little to the right.

754
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,786
Tau Seven's rising.

755
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,222
Lockwood? Right there.

756
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,552
Getting warmer. Threepointfive.
Right out.

757
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,786
NNegative. You see? We got nothin'.

758
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,522
Steve. Got something. NNo, Steve's up top.

759
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:16,128
NNight vision's malfunctioning. Mine, too.

760
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:22,043
Got anything? Let's go!

761
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,484
Tighten it up, guys. Tighten it up.

762
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,154
Watch your flank.

763
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,434
Watch your three. Watch your three.

764
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,105
Sweep right.

765
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,573
I got nothin'.

766
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,443
Kelly, go with him. Yes, sir.

767
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,691
Got anything? All clear.

768
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:24,296
NNight vision's malfunctioning.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

769
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,812
What is this crap?

770
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:55,395
Kelly? Kelly, check in. Man down. Man down.

771
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,940
Get a light out.

772
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,268
NNo. NNo flares. It'll give our position away.

773
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:05,174
They know our position. Yeah, Sergeant.

774
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,574
Stay sharp.

775
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,287
Where you at?

776
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,331
What the hell was that? Blackwood!

777
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,403
Answer up. What's this?

778
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,165
Major, we gotta get a light out.

779
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,432
NNo. I said no. Tighten up.

780
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,739
Where? Where? Heads up! Heads up!

781
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:37,876
My night vision's crapped out.

782
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,446
I got nothin'. I got nothin'.
They must be jammin' 'em.

783
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,817
Son of a.

784
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,594
Ah, hell. Let's see these bastards.

785
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:27,685
O'Bannon. You were right. Get 'em.

786
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,164
I'll do my best, sir.

787
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,710
I've radioed command.
They're sending reinforcements. ETA ten hours.

788
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,945
Tau Seven could indeed break down
the ozone layer and accelerate global warming.

789
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,313
But you need massive amounts.

790
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,047
Well, they could be shielding it so all
we're picking up are traces.

791
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:34,754
Okay. Well, a tight atmospheric beam would be
hidden deep underground, but the emitter couldn't.

792
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,224
You need a clear view of the sky.

793
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,434
Satellite recon of the island showed nothing.

794
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:43,199
Maybe that emitter is in the sector
where Al killed the alien.

795
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,504
I'll find him. Take me with you.

796
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:46,865
We need to communicate with them.

797
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,171
These creatures don't communicate. They kill.

798
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,744
Well, I'm willing to risk it. I'm not.

799
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,403
Our first encounter with alien life?

800
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,139
I've dreamed about this. I've worked for this.

801
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,444
Don't take this away from me. I'm sorry.

802
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,490
Angel. Let's go for a ride.

803
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,272
Thirtytwo years. All this time they've been here

804
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,565
Grandma knew. I didn't listen.

805
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,867
I never should have left.

806
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,841
Wanted to be a bigtime homicide detective.

807
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,238
And miss all this?

808
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,008
I oughtta patent these.

809
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,880
Blatnikoff's homemade alien killer bullets.

810
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,023
What do you think? Catchy.

811
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,891
Like the tat. Thanks.

812
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,594
Looks Asian.

813
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:47,894
Somalia.

814
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,604
Lost a few mates there.

815
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,537
Um, so Captain O'Bannon. Do you, uh.

816
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,011
NNever married, no girlfriend

817
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,445
not gay, as far as I know.

818
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,618
That's not what I was gonna ask.

819
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,978
It's what you wanted to know.

820
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,920
Another one? Yep.

821
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,489
You don't really think you could change him,
do ya?

822
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,661
Well, uh, well, I mean, I.

823
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,900
It's a good thing you're useful then.

824
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,834
Thanks.

825
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:37,711
This is it.

826
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,313
Most isolated spot of the island.

827
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,023
Perfect place for the emitters beam.

828
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,250
This is where Waters killed that first alien.

829
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,359
Could be heading right into a nest.

830
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,964
They wouldn't attack in broad daylight,
would they?

831
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,064
Why not?

832
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,469
Don't know.
Just hoping they were nocturnal or something.

833
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,141
Your man was here.

834
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,326
I don't remember this.

835
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,228
What the hell?

836
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,013
What the hell?

837
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,423
Amazing.

838
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:04,803
Sweet Jesus and Mary.
It's like a hologram or something.

839
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,634
You know all these years, we couldn't see it.

840
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,709
Somebody saw it.

841
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,390
What are you doing?

842
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:38,369
Healing. Better. Resting easy.

843
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,670
Go away.

844
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,162
Did I dream it?

845
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,238
I don't wanna do this, ill. But I have to.

846
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,577
Roger, AlphaTango One out.

847
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,740
Red eyes. Red eyes.

848
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,812
Easy, easy. D. Help's on its way.
You're gonna be fine.

849
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,643
NNo, your friend, Stubbles.

850
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,180
Captain Waters? Yes.

851
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,155
Don't struggle. Pray for me.

852
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,857
Let her go. Let her go!

853
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,731
Let me see your hands.

854
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,860
Stand up. Slow.

855
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,836
Turn around.

856
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,711
Hi, Steve. utside.

857
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,488
Rest. Rest.

858
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,094
Sit down.

859
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,034
What's happened to you?

860
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,941
I switched teams. Joined the winners.

861
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,307
They haven't won yet.

862
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,176
We were halfway through extinction even
before they got here.

863
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,410
Would have cooked the planet ourselves
in a few millennia.

864
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,680
So they decide to speed things up,
help it along?

865
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,947
They need food and we're in the way,
as simple as that.

866
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,351
Then they're gonna starve.

867
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,484
You think you can beat 'em?

868
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,265
You're so scared of 'em you can't even sleep.

869
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,228
Were the nightmares part of the plan?

870
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:50,029
NNo, just a side effect.
When they landed in '75...

871
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,069
they transmitted a message home.

872
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,934
They had no idea we'd pick up
a little echo of it.

873
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,809
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

874
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,071
Get your hands up.

875
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,876
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

876
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,548
How's that?

877
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:15,553
Jill, I hurt Jill. It forced me. I, I couldn't.

878
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,063
Al.

879
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:22,566
Listen. There's a transmitter. It's huge.
Tau Seven.

880
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,636
I know, I saw it. You gotta take it out fast.

881
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,166
They know we know.

882
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,604
They slam it into overtime, everything they got.

883
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,143
It wrecks the ozone layer within hours.

884
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,777
You gotta shut it down now.
Or Earth's a desert.

885
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,645
NNo, if they could do it that fast,
they would have done it already.

886
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:43,224
NNo. Slow's better. Evolves nice big bugs.
Best way kills all life.

887
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:48,388
We forced their hand. You gotta believe me.
You, you gotta believe me.

888
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,498
Al, how many of them are there?
Just only a few.

889
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,242
Grenade!

890
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:41,512
Mental!

891
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,268
GrayAlpha, GrayAlpha.
Over. EchoTango One.

892
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:14,608
I repeat, GrayAlpha. GrayAlpha. Over.

893
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,249
EchoTango One. This is Collaroy.
We read you.

894
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,188
You've gotta be kidding me. NNo, I'm not.

895
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,553
Waters was right. Tau Seven's rising.

896
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,489
Best estimate in two hours
the ozone layer gets depleted,

897
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:31,925
Earth overheats and we die.

898
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,226
What about the reinforcements?
NNo. Take too long.

899
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,767
So we take out the emitter ourselves.

900
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,404
With what? All the munitions are blown up.

901
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,540
All your space alien killer bullets are gone.

902
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:41,572
Not quite.

903
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,540
Somebody had the presence of mind to hang
onto one magazine.

904
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,440
Well, there's four rounds in it.

905
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,606
Four rounds. Great. NNothing to worry about.

906
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,778
All right, listen up.

907
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:56,454
NNavy's received execute authority
to launch a cruise missile to destroy the emitter.

908
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,490
But it's sealed in.
How's the missile gonna latch onto the target?

909
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,323
We designate the target with a radio beacon.

910
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,231
We gotta get one of these within
a hundred meters.

911
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,001
Angel, you know the island.
Any other way to get to that emitter?

912
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,569
Um, on the north side there's a trail,

uh, if I can find it.

913
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:14,266
Okay, good. You two go that way.
I'll approach from the valley floor. South.

914
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:15,804
Gives us two opportunities.

915
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:18,740
1600 is dropdead time for activation.

916
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,742
Gives us approximately one hour. Got it.

917
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:25,010
This is it. Let's get it done. NNo worries.

918
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,163
How's she doing? Sleeping.

919
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:43,970
Go kill red eyes. Yeah, kill red eyes.

920
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,004
Take good care of her.

921
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:58,845
Hey. What are you doing?

922
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,988
I'm driving. NNo, you're not. Get out.

923
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,054
That doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does.

924
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,725
I'm in charge. I decide.

925
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,827
You can't drive and shoot at the same time,

can you?

926
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,788
Good point. Get in.

927
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:13,902
What's the matter?

928
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,034
Mule's missing.

929
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,402
Taggart.

930
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,013
Captain Waters!

931
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:33,684
Captain Waters, I know you're here.
Talk to me.

932
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,749
Captain Waters.

933
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:42,955
Oh, my God.

934
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,326
I'm, I'm, I'm not your enemy.

935
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,470
I don't understand.

936
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:55,071
Bring out Captain Waters.
We can communicate through him.

937
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:12,152
I believe you want to understand me.

938
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,757
You must stop this chaos now.

939
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,920
We could be friends.

940
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:27,138
Yes. Yes. That's it. Friendship.
Communication.

941
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:38,652
Yes. You understand me, don't you?

942
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,285
We understand each other.

943
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,364
You understand us.

944
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,270
We're gonna die, you know that?

945
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,813
So why in God's name are you humming?

946
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:13,044
Sergeant Ricky Blatnikoff of EchoTango
One is about to stick it to alien bloody invaders.

947
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:17,391
NNobody in my family ever did sweet F.A.
and here I am about to defend the entire planet.

948
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:20,484
NNah. You really are mental.

949
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,132
That's just a nickname.

950
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,338
Guess they didn't come in peace.

951
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:29,357
So the missile hones in on this radio
beacon thing. What if they jam it?

952
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,132
We're screwed. They claim they're jamproof.

953
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,766
But they're made in China, so.

954
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,756
E.T., bugger off.

955
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,995
What are you looking at, ugly little mongrel
bloody thing? You should have taken the hint.

956
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:05,256
We got the bastard.
The bastard's got us, you dickhead.

957
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,832
I saved your damn life.
Yeah, and stuff the damn planet.

958
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,534
I told 'em,
I told the brass we needed real equipment.

959
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,832
Rocket launchers, EMPs,

960
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,837
bunker busters, fragmentation mines.

961
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:18,102
And do they appreciate my foresight
and preparation?

962
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:21,209
Oh, no. Wankers wouldn't even give me
one little suitcase nuke.

963
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,114
I can't imagine why.

964
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:33,755
I'm activating the beacon.
We're gonna need to get out of here real quick.

965
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,597
Okay. I'm arming it. Keep your eyes pealed.

966
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,745
Got about four minutes.

967
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,417
Steve, three minutes!

968
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,260
Al?

969
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,331
Steve. You gotta get outta here. Al?

970
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,131
Steve. Two minutes.

971
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:06,781
You gotta leave me.
I can't move my legs. I won't make it.

972
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:11,676
I'll guard the beacon. Go. Go!

973
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,619
Give 'em hell.

974
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,979
Good. Company.

975
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,217
Ten seconds!

976
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,660
Get down!

977
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:59,395
Hey, ugly. Incoming.

978
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:14,838
There, you beauty! Tea and medals!

979
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:22,981
Red eye's gone! Red eye's gone.

980
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,656
All right? Yeah.

981
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,922
It worked.

982
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,433
We got 'em? We got 'em.

983
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:54,750
For God so loved the world,

that he gave his only begotten son that

984
01:24:54,956 --> 01:25:01,259
whoever believe within him should not perish
but have everlasting life. Amen.

985
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:02,520
Amen.

986
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,309
Absent friends.

987
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:28,848
Steve. I have to know. How much was real?

988
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:33,317
He wanted to talk about children.
Was that a lie?

989
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:37,624
NNo. He loved you. And he wanted kids.

990
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,164
ids and a farm.

991
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:45,969
To grow grapes? Grapes.

992
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,909
illed the aliens and saved the Earth.

993
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,748
Red eye's gone. Home. Sleep.

994
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:05,056
I should have trusted you.
I should have listened.

995
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,390
I'm sorry. I feel like crap. You should.

996
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,201
They're still out there somewhere, aren't they?

997
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,399
That's a pretty good bet.

998
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,073
You gonna keep looking for 'em?

999
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,674
Oh, I do whatever they tell me to do.

1000
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,380
But right now they told me to
take thirty days leave.

1001
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,547
You got any plans?

1002
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:33,515
Oh, sleep for about a week
and then some quality vacation time.

1003
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:36,754
Where you goin'? NNowhere hot.

1004
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,387
You like snow? Yeah. I love snow.

1005
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:44,789
Good.
