THERE HAS TO BE SOME ORDER IN THIS WORLD!"

PUBLISHER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO PRINT MY POEMS..."

68
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:20,606
"OH BOY, YOU MIGHT BECOME
QUITE A FAMOUS MAN."

69
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:49,685
"HOW COULD AN OLD PRO LIKE YOU
BE SO FAR OFF THE MARK IN YOUR JUDGEMENT?!"

70
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:57,153
"THE POEMS ARE QUITE NICE... BUT THEY ARE
DEFINITELY NOT PUBLISHING MATERIAL!"

71
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:17,803
"NOW I DON'T DARE TO GO TO THE PUBLISHER...
WITH MY SHABBY SUIT..."

72
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:26,704

YOU REALLY DO LOOK PRETTY SCRUFFY..."

73
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:29,189
"WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIX THAT FOR YOU..."

74
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:05,993
"THE OLD BAG SEEMS
TO HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU..."

75
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:09,549
"SHE USUALLY ISN'T
DECEIVED THAT EASILY."

76

"I THINK I'LL ACCOMPANY MY WRITER FRIEND
TO PICK OUT SOME NEW CLOTHES..."

77

"I'M SOMEWHAT OF AN EXPERT
IN THAT FIELD."

78
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,684
"ARE YOU COMING BACK AGAIN?"

79
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:30,701
"THIS SO-CALLED PROFESSOR CLAIMS
THAT LORENZ'S POEMS ARE WORTHLESS."

80
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,626
"YES, BUT...
WHAT WILL LORENZ SAY TO THAT?"

81
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:06,923
"NO, NO, MY GOOD MAN...
WE MUST DRINK TO THE VERY PROMISING..."

82
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:09,945
"BEGINNING OF
THIS LITERARY CAREER!"

83
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,749
"WHERE IS LORENZ?"

84
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:38,593
"AND WHY ISN'T MELANIE HERE YET?"

85
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:22,362
"FIRST OF ALL, SOME CHAMPAGNE!"

86
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,163
"EVEN IF WE BURN
THROUGH ALL THE MONEY..."

87
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:41,605
"THE OLD BAG HAS MORE
IN THE CASHBOX, RIGHT?"

88
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,570
"CHEERS, POET!"

89
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,831
"I'LL LOOK AT WHOMEVER I PLEASE!"

90
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,983
"YOU'VE MADE A CONQUEST, LUBOTA!"

91
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,229
"BUT HE'S MY BROTHER!!!"

00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:36,008
"HAVE YOU HEARD, THE OLD HARLAN WANTS TO HAVE HIS
DAUGHTER VERONIKA ENGAGED TO THE RICH WIEDENBERG!"

93
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:46,415
"IS THAT TRUE... WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID
ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT OF VERONICA HARLAN?"

94
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:49,240
"SAY THERE, LITTLE ONE, YOUR BROTHER LORENZ
IS IN GOOD WITH OLD SCHWABE, ISN'T HE?"

95
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:58,432
"MY BROTHER LORENZ IS THE MOST
HONEST MAN IN THE WORLD..."

96
00:42:58,433 --> 00:43:02,050
"AND THE ONLY ONE MY AUNT SCHWABE
DOESN'T THINK IS A SCOUNDREL!"

97
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,545
"WE WOULD LIKE TO INQUIRE
AS TO WHY THE CITY CLERK LUBOTA..."

98
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:44,914
"HAS BEEN AWAY FROM WORK
WITHOUT AN EXCUSED ABSENCE?"

99
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:49,804
"MY SON IS ILL..."

100
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:27,833
"WE HAVE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE
"INDISPOSED" MR. LUBOTA WHO HAS BEEN..."

101
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:32,963

A SCANDAL IN FRONT OF THE HARLAN HOUSE."

102
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:52,923
"ACCORDING TO THE COACHMAN, YOU'VE ALREADY
FOLLOWED MISS VERONIKA AROUND ONCE..."

103
00:45:16,242 --> 00:45:21,089
"CITY CLERK YOU USED TO BE, MR. LUBOTA!"

104
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,481
"DO YOU KNOW WHERE
LORENZ IS TODAY, FATHER?"

105
00:45:55,657 --> 00:46:00,815
"I'M IN NO HURRY TO TELL LORENZ
HOW UNSUCCESSFUL HIS POEMS ARE."

106
00:46:13,212 --> 00:46:16,995
"WELL, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LORENZ,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU AND THE HARLANS?"

107
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,243
"MOTHER... LAST NIGHT..."

108
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:27,972
"THE WORLD FELL DOWN AROUND ME!"

109
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:52,846
"IF YOU LOVE ME, MOTHER, DON'T ASK ME!
I HAVE NO TO LOSE! ..."

110
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:54,454
"I HAVE TO GO THE HARLANS!"

111
00:47:09,255 --> 00:47:15,453
"IF I ONLY KNEW HOW I COULD GET YOUR BROTHER
TO REALLY TAKE THE OLD BAG TO THE CLEANERS."

112
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:25,542
"I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU ONCE! LEAVE MY BROTHER
OUT OF THIS! HE'S TOO GOOD FOR THIS!"

113
00:48:54,066 --> 00:49:01,271
"DEAR MADAM... IS IT TRUE... THAT YOU WISH
TO ENGAGE YOUR DAUGTER TO MR. WEIDENBERG?"

114
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:22,723
"I KNOW I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THIS MATTER! NEVERTHELESS,
FOR GOD'S SAKE... HAVE PITY! ANSWER ME!"

115
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:47,746
"CALL MY HUSBAND!"

116
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:22,847
"DEAR MADAM...
I'VE ONLY SEEN YOUR DAUGHTER ONCE..."

117
00:50:22,848 --> 00:50:27,426
"BUT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
THE HOPE OF WINNING HER FOR MYSELF!"

118
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:39,061
"DON'T THINK I'M A FOOL, DEAR MADAM!
THIS LOVE OVERTOOK ME LIKE FATE! ..."

119
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:44,369
"TO GIVE UP ON IT WOULD BE
LIKE ME GIVING UP ON GOD!"

120
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:43,069
"WON'T YOU SHARE YOUR WORRIES WITH ME,
MOTHER LUBOTA? IS LORENZ SICK?"

121
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:55,841
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM!
HE ISN'T MY LORENZ ANYMORE! ..."

122
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:59,891
"HE'S A STRANGER... SOMEONE I
DON'T KNOW... WHO DOESN'T KNOW ME!"

123
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:08,854
"HOW CAN ONE HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT LORENZ...
EVEN FOR A MINUTE, MOTHER?!"

124
00:52:42,575 --> 00:52:50,175
"I CAN'T LEAVE, MR. HARLAN, UNTIL I'M ASSURED THAT
YOU WILL SUPPORT MY COURTING YOUR DAUGHTER..."

125
00:52:56,434 --> 00:53:01,349
"IT WOULD BE AN HONOR, MR. LUBOTA,
SHALL WE SAY IN A WHILE...?"

126
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,726
"TO THE BEST TAVERN IN THE CITY!"

127
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:39,563
"FORGIVE ME... PLEASE...
AN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SIMILARITY..."

128
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:55,993
"YOU MAY STAY... IF YOU LIKE.
WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE ANYWAY."

129
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:15,111
"CHAMPAGNE! I'D LIKE TO DRINK CHAMPAGNE!"

130
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:33,324
"TELL ME, MARIE,
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE..."

131
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:38,625
"NO, FATHER!"

132
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:17,680
"WHAT I WANTED TO SAY... LORENZ LUBOTA
IS DEVELOPING HIS POETIC GENIUS..."

133
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:21,976
"HE'S ONLY TRAVELING
IN THE BEST CIRCLES NOW."

134
00:59:30,677 --> 00:59:34,515
"WHAT THAT BOY COULD BECOME...
IF ONLY HE HAD MONEY!"

135
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:50,058
"HE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO HAVE MONEY...
JUST MONEY!"

136
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:24,675
"NO...! NO...! DON'T RUN
AWAY FROM ME! NOT YOU TOO!"

137
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:35,579
"WHO ARE YOU?"

138
01:00:38,929 --> 01:00:42,023
"I'M... A CITY CLERK
DRIVEN FROM HIS JOB!"

139
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:59,133
"DON'T TELL THIS JOKE IN FRONT OF
MY MOTHER, OR SHE'LL THROW YOU OUT!"

140
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:06,001
"TELL ME, WHO ARE YOU!"

141
01:01:12,056 --> 01:01:17,209
"I... AM A POET... A MAN WITH NO LUCK...
WHO CHASES A SHADOW... A PHANTOM!"

142
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:58,531
"I WANT TO KNOW... WHAT DROVE YOU
TO ME, LIKE A SLEEPWALKER..."

143
01:01:58,532 --> 01:02:03,330
"I WANT TO KNOW, WHO DO YOU
IMAGES KISSING WHEN YOU KISS ME?"

144
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:50,809
"UNFORTUNATELY, MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE TOTALLY
DESTITUTE... YOU UNDERSTAND ME, DON'T YOU? ..."

145
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:57,350
"MELITTA LET SLIP THAT YOU'RE A FAMOUS POET...
I HOPE YOUR INCOME CORRESPONDS TO YOUR FAME!"

146
01:04:05,249 --> 01:04:09,037
"YOU'RE RIGHT... ONE HAS TO PAY...
THERE'S A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING!"

147
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:30,588
"MY SON IS NOT AT HOME..."

148
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,133
"HE NEEDN'T BOTHER TO COME
TO CITY HALL ANY MORE..."

149
01:04:42,134 --> 01:04:44,375
"HE'S FREE OF THAT CONCERN!"

150
01:05:36,513 --> 01:05:41,905
"LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, BROTHER-IN-LOW!
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND!"

151
01:06:12,689 --> 01:06:20,689
"CHILDREN, IF WE STUCK TOGETHER AND HAD THE RIGHT
CLOTHES... WE COULD SET UP A SPLENDID BUSINESS!"

152
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,998
"I... NEED MONEY!"

153
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:37,853
"MY DEAR CHILD, I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF WITH YOU LOVE
AFFAIRS... SO PLEASE DON'T INTERFERE IN MY BUSINESS AFFAIRS!!"

154
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,671
"THE ONLY PERSON WE CAN HIT UP FOR MONEY
IS OLD SCHWABE, THAT'S FOR SURE! ..."

155
01:08:01,672 --> 01:08:06,441
"HOW ABOUT IF LORENZ OFFERED HER
HIS POET'S ROYALTIES?"

156
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:22,281
"WELL, MY BOY, PASSING ONESELF OFF A POET HAS CONSEQUENCES...
OR ELSE DO WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A GULLIBLE AUNT."

157
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:52,278
"YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HELP ME, AUNT SCHWABE! ..."

158
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,518
"THE WORLD IS CLOSED TO THOSE
WHO ARRIVE WITH EMPTY HANDS!"

159
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:11,171
"PEOPLE ARE SCOUNDRELS, LORENZ... ALL OF THEM!
THERE'S ONLY ONE I TRUST... THAT'S YOU!"

160
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:24,005
"THIS BOY HERE... HE WOULDN'T GET A PENNY FROM
ME! BUT YOU... YOU SHALL HAVE THE MONEY!"

161
01:10:38,126 --> 01:10:43,191
"I CAN'T STAND IT...! I DON'T WANT
THIS...!! I'M NO SCOUNDREL!!"

162
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:52,652
"THEN EXPOSE THE WHOLE LIE
AND BE A NOTHING..."

163
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:55,553
"AND HUNGRY FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE!"

164
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,604
"AND... HER?"

165
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,600
THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION

166
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:02,797
"I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH LORENZ!"

167
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:14,411
"YOU'RE TALKING TO THE WRONG PERSON! I
HAVEN'T KNOWN WHERE LORENZ IS FOR DAYS NOW."

168
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:26,814
"AND NOW SHOPPING!
BUY A HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS...!"

169
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:50,374
"YOU DON'T SEEM WELL... I WOULD THINK THAT
LORENZ WOULD HAVE TAKEN BETTER CARE OF YOU."

170
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:30,207
To Mr. Lorenz Lubota: It is a fact
that you have been away from work...

171
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:36,308
without an excused absence, that you have frequented
and behaved scandalously in questionable taverns...

172
01:15:36,309 --> 01:15:42,309
and further, that you have harassed
highly esteemed citizens of the community.

173
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:48,310
Moreover, your unqualified behaviour
towards city clerk Hermann Schraat...

174
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:54,311
is considered a serious offense
against a public administrator.

175
01:15:54,312 --> 01:16:00,512
In view of the above, you are desmissed
immediately from your employment with the City...

176
01:16:00,513 --> 01:16:06,593
and are without claim
to any further wages.

177
01:16:18,752 --> 01:16:22,094
"WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY WANT?
WHY ARE YOU SPYING ON ME? ..."

178
01:16:22,095 --> 01:16:27,333
"YOU'VE NEVER ONCE SHOWN
ANY CONCERN FOR ME... WHY SUDDENLY NOW?"

179
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:38,076
"WHAT DO I WANT HERE? I LENT 60,000 MARKS TO LORENZ...
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S USING IT FOR."

180
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:56,871
"MY LORENZ IS AN HONEST MAN!!
HE CAN ANSWER FOR HIS ACTIONS! ..."

181
01:16:56,872 --> 01:17:00,572
"REMEMBER THAT AND LEAVE ME ALONE!"

182
01:17:04,603 --> 01:17:08,761
"I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I STAND!
I SHALL MAKE INQUIRIES..."

183
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:14,214
"IN ANY CASE, YOU CAN TELL LORENZ
THAT I EXPECT HIM AT MY PLACE TODAY!"

184
01:18:07,048 --> 01:18:10,748
"I LIKE BUY THIS FABRIC
FOR MY MOTHER."

185
01:18:30,688 --> 01:18:36,875
"THE FOUNDING OF THE WIGOTTSCHINSKY-LUBOTA
FIRM CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION!"

186
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:59,048
"I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU, MOTHER."

187
01:20:02,787 --> 01:20:07,577
"DID YOU BUY THAT WITH
THE MONEY FROM AUNT SCHWABE?"

188
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:21,889
"SHE WAS HERE... SHE ASKED ABOUT YOU...
YOU SHOULD GO TO HER TODAY..."

189
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:44,150
"WHY DID YOU WISH
TO SPEAK TO ME, AUNT?"

190
01:21:50,558 --> 01:21:55,373
"LORENZ, YOU'RE THE BIGGEST SCOUNDREL
I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE!"

191
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:12,712
"I'VE MADE SOME INQUIRIES...
AND NOW I KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH YOU! ..."

192
01:22:12,713 --> 01:22:17,238
"I DEMAND THE MONEY BACK
THAT YOU SWINDLED FROM ME!"

193
01:22:21,885 --> 01:22:26,675
"AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY ANYMORE,
AS YOU CLAIM... WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?"

194
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:53,971
"I DON'T OWE AN AXPLANATION
ABOUT HOW AND WHERE I SPEND MY MONEY."

195
01:22:56,847 --> 01:23:01,514
"YOUR MONEY? HOW DARE YOU
TALK ABOUT YOUR MONEY!..."

196
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:06,337
"WHAT'S COME OVER YOU? ARE YOU ALL
SUDDENLY POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL?!"

197
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:33,088
"YOU EITHER GIVE ME BACK THE MONEY... OR I'LL HAVE NO QUALMS
ABOUT HANDING YOU AND YOUR FINE FRIEND OVER TO THE POLICE!"

198
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:50,074
"I'LL GIVE YOU THREE DAYS TO CLEAR THE
MATTER UP COMPLETELY, NOT AN HOUR MORE..."

199
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:56,546
"I'LL TURN THE MATTER OVER TO THE
POLICE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT BY THEN!"

200
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:54,087
"SHE HAS UNCOVERED THE FRAUD...
SHE WENT TO SEE MOTHER..."

201
01:26:54,664 --> 01:26:58,798
"THE OLD BEAST KNOWS NO PITY WHEN SHE
THINKS HER MONEY IS IN DANGER! ..."

202
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:01,875
"SHE'LL BREAK YOUR NECK
WITHOUT MERCY!"

203
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:37,187
"YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE OLD BAG TO THE
CLEANERS A SECOND TIME... WITH FORCE IF NECESSARY!"

204
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:49,471
"I'D RATHER STAND IN THE TOWN SQUARE AND
PUBLICLY ADMIT MY MISTAKES AND DO PENANCE!"

205
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:56,360
"DO YOU THINK DOING THAT
WILL GET THE MONEY BACK?"

206
01:28:06,117 --> 01:28:11,827
"I WANT TO PAY THE MONEY BACK!
I WANT TO PAY BACK EVERY NICKEL AND DIME!"

207
01:28:14,607 --> 01:28:19,237
"FROM WHAT? FROM YOUR INCOME AS A DISCHARGED
CLERK... OR FROM YOUR POET'S ROYALTIES?"

208
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:27,148
"I CAN'T BREAK AWAY FROM HER!
I CAN'T BREAK AWAY FROM HER!"

209
01:30:48,405 --> 01:30:54,580
"CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M ON THE BRINK OF INSANITY?
SO PLEASE HELP ME! WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME...?"

210
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:07,300
"IF I COULD HELP YOU... IF I COULD RELEASE
YOU... THEN I WOULDN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE..."

211
01:33:56,342 --> 01:34:01,088
"MOTHER IS VERY ILL... I MUST
GO TO THE PHARMACY QUICKLY!"

212
01:34:31,156 --> 01:34:35,042
"MOTHER... MOTHER!
I'VE COME TO YOU... HELP ME!"

213
01:34:43,409 --> 01:34:47,360
"MY SON IS OUT THERE!"

214
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:21,187
"YOUR MOTHER IS VERY SICK, LORENZ... WE
HAVE TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM ANY EXCITEMENT!"

215
01:35:41,254 --> 01:35:45,958
"I'LL GIVE YOU THREE DAY...
NOT ONE HOUR MORE!!"

216
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:12,738
"MARIE... I HAVE TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING..."

217
01:36:17,358 --> 01:36:24,085
"MARIE... WHAT WOULD YOU SAY... IF SOMEONE WERE TELL
YOU... THAT I'VE BECOME A GOOD FOR NOTHING...?"

218
01:36:26,686 --> 01:36:30,786
"I WOULD LAUGH AT HIM, LORENZ!"

219
01:36:36,928 --> 01:36:40,801
"BUT IF HE WERE RIGHT, MARIE?"

220
01:37:41,716 --> 01:37:44,664
THE LAST ATTEMPT

221
01:38:00,227 --> 01:38:03,587
"I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU, AUNT..."

222
01:38:21,326 --> 01:38:26,974
"AUNT... I BEG YOU... HAVE MERCY...
I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE MONEY YET..."

223
01:38:26,975 --> 01:38:30,791
"AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHERE IT WENT!"

224
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:39,981
"THEN THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO
CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THIS MATTER."

225
01:39:02,995 --> 01:39:10,003
"YOU CAN ASK THE GENTLEMAN WHO DISCOVERED YOUR TALENT TO POST BAIL
FOR YOU... OR YOU CAN SIGN OVER YOUR FUTURE ROYALTIES TO ME..."

226
01:39:18,615 --> 01:39:22,432
"BUT NONE OF IT IS TRUE!
IT'S ALL FABRICATION! ..."

227
01:39:22,433 --> 01:39:26,733
"NO ONE WOULD EVEN GIVE ME
50 MARKS FOR MY TEN MISERABLE POEMS!"

228
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:39,061
"YES!! I LIED TO YOU! BUT I DON'T
WANT TO LIE ANY MORE... NEVER AGAIN!"

229
01:39:45,065 --> 01:39:49,760
"YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BATTER OFF
IF YOU HAD KEPT ON LYING, YOU FOOL! ..."

230
01:39:49,761 --> 01:39:54,106
"MAYBY THEN I WOULD HAVE GRANTED YOU A DEFERMENT TO
PAY BACK YOUR DEBT! BUT NOW... TO WHAT END...?!"

231
01:40:03,587 --> 01:40:08,619
"I CAN WELL IMAGINE WHAT KIND
OF WOMAN YOU THREW MY GOOD MONEY AT..."

232
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:13,172
"BUT I'LL HAVE THE POLICE AS MUCH ON
THAT WOMAN'S THROAT AS THEY ARE ON YOURS!"

233
01:40:27,886 --> 01:40:31,263
"WHERE IS LORENZ?"

234
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:36,590
"I DON'T KNOW, MOTHER...
BUT HE'LL BE BACK!"

235
01:40:46,587 --> 01:40:51,221
"NOW YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!!
WHEN THE WHOLE STORY COMES TO LIGHT..."

236
01:40:51,222 --> 01:40:55,657
"YOU'LL GO TO JAIL AND IT WILL BE
THE DEATH OF YOUR MOTHER!"

237
01:41:02,298 --> 01:41:04,723
"WELL THEN, AGREED...
TOMORROW EVENING..."

238
01:41:36,436 --> 01:41:38,724
"DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY?!"

239
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:54,293
"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY BUSINESS NOW,
I JUST WANT TO HAVE A NICE DINNER WITH YOU."

240
01:43:10,496 --> 01:43:12,778
"CHEERS, HERE'S TO A LONG LIFE!"

241
01:43:45,347 --> 01:43:49,254
"WHO IS WALKING BACK
AND FORTH SO RESTLESSLY?"

242
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:24,324
"DON'T YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP TOO,
LORENZ, IT'S ALMOST 2 A.M.!"

243
01:46:25,951 --> 01:46:31,905
"WE'RE LOST... WE'RE BOTH LOST...
WE'VE GONE TO THE DOGS!"

244
01:47:05,448 --> 01:47:10,217
"CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THE ADDRESSEE LIVES?
THE HOUSE NUMBER IS WRONG."

245
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:21,900
"DAMMIT!
THE OLD BAG'S NIGHT BELL!"

246
01:50:16,441 --> 01:50:18,586
"NO! NO! DON'T!!"

247
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:13,708
"YOU DON'T NEED TO TIE ME UP...
I'LL GO WITH YOU VOLUNTARILY."

248
01:52:51,544 --> 01:52:55,414
"DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS,
BE GOOD TO MOTHER! FAREWELL!"

249
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:34,329
THE PENANCE...

250
01:53:58,930 --> 01:54:01,577
AND THE REDEMPTION

251
01:55:04,103 --> 01:55:08,295
"WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
LORENZ, TO BRING YOU HOME!"

252
01:55:39,532 --> 01:55:42,286
"LOOK, LORENZ... YOUR NEW HOME!"

253
01:55:54,628 --> 01:56:01,493
But I have the consolation that my good Mother
died in the firm belief that I was ill.

254
01:56:55,745 --> 01:57:00,487
"DID FATHER'S BOOK DO JUSTICE?"

255
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:05,326
"YES, MARIE!..."

256
01:57:13,965 --> 01:57:17,506
THE END
