Okay, I was a bad narrator again...

310

...because the kid at the beginning,
the magician, that was me.

that how pitying someone...

...and wanting to fuck them
can get all tangled up in your head.

I'm busy working on Harmony's case.

750
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,342
Case, what case? Leave her alone.

751
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,762

Call me after.

752
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,474
- -a kidnapping gone wrong.
It is unclear why his daughter...

753
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,559
... was subsequently murdered
or where...

754
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:11,480
... for she was almost certainly killed
and then moved, police sources say.

755
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,483
Veronica Dexter was reported missing
yesterday afternoon...

756
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,361
... when she failed to greet
her boyfriend at the airport.

757
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:20,739
Miss Dexter recently made headlines
when she returned from Paris...

758
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:24,243
...and withdrew her multimillion-
dollar lawsuit against her father...

759
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,120
...actor-turned-entrepreneur
Harlan Dexter.

760

Mr. Dexter owns
the prestigious Dexter Clinic.

761
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:33,210
His wife died last spring,
prompting Veronica 's return to the U. S...

762
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:37,172
... and a father-daughter reconciliation
following years of estrangement.

Veronica Dexter,
25 years old yesterday. Paul.

HARRY: We were just at that party.
Are you telling me...

765
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,974
...that the girl in the lake,
that was Veronica Dexter?

766
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,934

Positive ID, scars, dental records.

767

HARRY: You talked to your police guy?
- Yeah, not much there.

Boils down to this:

Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon
about 4:30, left her home.

771
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:04,658
Went off to the airport, pick up
some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.

772
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:08,412
- That was the last anybody saw of her?
- With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.

773
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,080
Police ever find the car?

No, genius, that was us. Remember?

Oh, yeah, right.

776
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,087
- The killers were at the party, Harry.
- They were?

777
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:20,465
- The killers were at Dexter's?
- That's how they recognized you.

778
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:23,844
It's getting too scary. You gotta bail.
Get a flight out, today.

779
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,846

I'll go Wednesday.

You're not getting the part.

Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.

782
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,103
- I know it's a long shot.
- You're not gonna get the part.

You're not listening to me.
You won't get the-- Harry. Harry!

Colin Farrell wants too much money.

New kid, works for cheap.

off of Colin Farrell's price tag.

00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,340
Sorry, chief. There it is.

792
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,634
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

793

take a swing at me. You fuck!

Stop.

Don't bother asking Harmony out
on your date.

797
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:19,983
She wasn't very happy to find out that
you're not a detective, that you lied.

798
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,027
- You told her?
- Pick those up.

Pick them up.

You didn't have to tell her.

Big tough guy.

1487
01:36:56,692 --> 01:36:58,026
Yeah, that's right.

1488
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:01,905
Big tough guy.

1489

[MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]

1490
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:20,799
I prefer Genaros, but what do I know?
I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.

1491
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:32,978
HARRY: That's it. That's the true story
of what happened last Christmas.

1492
01:37:33,145 --> 01:37:36,815
That was some pretty harsh shit
with the old guy back there, right?

1493
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:39,943
But whatever, he's creepy.
Fuck him. Don't worry about him.

1494
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:42,279
Anyhow, so....

1495
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,156
Thanks for coming.

1496
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:47,868
Thanks for taking the trip to L.A.
with me.

1497
01:37:48,952 --> 01:37:50,871
If I had to sum it up,
and I do--

1498
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:53,457
Because, you know,
it's, like, the end.

1499
01:37:53,624 --> 01:37:58,128
- -I would say that this movie is about--
It's about friendship.

1500
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:00,506
- Friendship is sacred.
- What are you doing?

1501
01:38:00,672 --> 01:38:02,382
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...

1502
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:04,843
...and leave the people
with a message.

1503
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:08,805
I've got a message for you.
Get your feet off my fucking desk.

1504
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:11,058
Sorry. I work for Perry now.

1505
01:38:11,225 --> 01:38:12,935
- And stop narrating.
[MUFFLED]: Obviously.

1506
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:15,479
That's it.
Please stay for the end credits.

1507
01:38:15,646 --> 01:38:19,024
If you're wondering who the best boy is,
it's someone's nephew.

1508
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:21,068
Don't forget to validate your parking.

1509
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:23,445
For all of you good people
in the Midwest...

1510
01:38:23,612 --> 01:38:25,197
...sorry we said "fuck" so much.

1511
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:27,157
- Say good night.
- Thanks again.

1512
01:38:27,324 --> 01:38:29,159
Now, go. Vanish.
