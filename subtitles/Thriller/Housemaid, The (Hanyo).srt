1
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:01,648
It's cold.
Where should we go?

2
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,159
Anywhere, just make it quick.

3
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,543
It's ready.

4
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,872
What happened?

5
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,714
She jumped.

6
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,148
Is she dead?

7
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:09,344
I don't know.

8
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,685
Step aside.

9
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,749
Over here!

10
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,756
It's over here.

11
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,071
Someone must've fallen
from the roof.

12
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:32,165
Suicide?

13
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:33,368
I don't know.

14
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,239
Let's go check it out.

15
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:38,338
Someone died,
and you wanna watch?

16
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:40,144
Let's go see it later.

17
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,462
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

18
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:24,345
Excuse me.

19
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:26,848
Do you know where
Lee Eun-yi lives?

20
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,571
Forgive me for entering
your home without permission.

21
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:31,745
But I need to be careful
about new hires.

22
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:36,950
I checked your resume
and references and so on.

23
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:41,354
But I wanted to see for myself
how you lived.

24
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,658
Please don't misunderstand.

25
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:44,659
Yes.

26
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,667
Not much of a talker, are you?

27
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,870
I heard you have a small
apartment in Pyung-taek?

28
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:01,342
Yes, I had to rent it out.

29
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,964
You went over
everything with Mrs. Cho?

30
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,458
You're here
on her recommendation.

31
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,569
We appreciate your help.

32
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,872
No, ma'am.
Thank you.

33
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,445
It's huge, isn't it?

34
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,350
It is quite large.

35
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:17,545
It's because there are
two of them in there.

36
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,056
You didn't tell her?

37
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:25,960
Mrs. Cho...

38
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,262
I told you
not to do that again.

39
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,358
Oh, twins are no problem...

40
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,963
I'll work out
the terms again, ma'am.

41
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,050
Should fit you perfectly.

42
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,057
Don't let them see you
in anything else.

43
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,551
It's nice, but...

44
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,960
I never wore anything
like this at work before.

45
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,359
Madam's underwear is
in her bathroom,

46
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:09,371
you should hand wash it.

47
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,935
When you get that big,
you pee just by sneezing.

48
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,551
Look in
the laundry basket, please.

49
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,570
You're Nami, right?
I'm the new nanny, Eun-yi.

50
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,537
I told you
a new maid was coming today.

51
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:50,637
I know.

52
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,455
Aren't you going to go
greet your mother?

53
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:03,356
After I change
and wash my hands.

54
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,742
I can do it myself.

55
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,841
Then call me if you need me.

56
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:29,748
Okay.

57
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,844
- Should I close the door?
- Yes, please.

58
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,062
Do you like the new maid?

59
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,365
She likes me a lot.

60
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:55,536
- Did she say that?
- No.

61
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,536
Then how do you know?

62
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,846
I can see it in her face.

63
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,771
It's all going to
be thrown out.

64
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,170
We might as well eat it.

65
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:29,736
Okay.

66
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,058
Are you insane?

67
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,366
I'm sorry.

68
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,872
He's here.

69
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,353
She's new, sir.
She'll be here for a while.

70
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:15,752
This is Lee Eun-yi,

71
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:18,658
She took care of
Hyun's baby brother for 3 years.

72
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,855
She's divorced and living alone.

73
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,364
Ah, do you have any children?

74
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:27,468
Have a seat, please.

75
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:41,845
Go tell Mom

76
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:45,149
there's no need to come down.
I'll be right up.

77
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,245
Okay.

78
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:54,162
I'm Goh Hoon.
Nami's father.

79
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,861
Lee Eun-yi, sir.

80
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:02,767
I don't have anything to say
in particular.

81
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,173
But you'll be raising my kids...

82
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,238
And cooking the food I'll eat.

83
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:14,543
You're an important person.
I should greet you properly.

84
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:20,851
Madam? Would you send up
a bottle of red wine?

85
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,268
He calls you madam?

86
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:47,348
Sometimes.
When he feels like it.

87
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,761
Take it up to him.

88
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:23,348
Were you grouchy all day again?

89
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,952
I can't even breathe.
And my stomach's so itchy.

90
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,958
You exercise too much.

91
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,753
I need to be healthy
for a natural delivery.

92
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,267
You know, the doctors say
that won't be easy.

93
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:41,768
Of course they say that.

94
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,967
A C-section
is easier for them.

95
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,942
They'll do as I tell them.
You sure you can handle it?

96
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,340
Of course. I'm the mom.

97
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,056
Ms. Lee used to be an early
childhood education major.

98
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:06,555
What does that have to do
with actually raising kids?

99
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,264
I guess.
She seems kind of childlike.

100
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:14,364
That's good.
She'll get along with the kids.

101
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,342
Eun-yi?

102
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:32,849
Yes?

103
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,163
You're still awake?

104
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:50,065
Can you leave the door
open a little?

105
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:56,944
This much?

106
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:58,844
More please.

107
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,045
Thank you.

108
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,653
Who's playing?

109
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:49,962
Black pepper.

110
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,266
Two times.

111
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,272
Take it.

112
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:27,958
The Beethoven sounded nice.

113
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,171
- Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:48,340
- Breakfast, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

115
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:53,049
- Me, too. Breakfast, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

116
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,065
That's too hot.

117
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,847
I think Mr. Goh is back, ma'am.

118
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,257
I should clean the washroom...

119
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,168
My fingernails tomorrow, please.

120
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:41,869
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,956
Try it. If you want more,
stop by my father's house.

122
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,754
Drink, it's good.

123
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,366
Oops.

124
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:53,461
Much better!

125
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,999
- You brought your swimsuit, right?
- Yes.

126
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:26,762
One, two, three.

127
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:36,938
Gotcha!

128
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,548
You're a good swimmer.

129
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:43,141
You're floating!

130
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,055
Up you go.

131
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:54,359
It's so cold...

132
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:56,759
Mmm, hot water!

133
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:18,050
You know why I'm not getting
a C-section, baby?

134
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:22,951
I'm going to have
4 or 5 children.

135
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:40,639
I don't get why your brother's
wife topped after two kids.

136
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:50,541
That's for common people
who have to struggle to raise them.

137
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:55,256
Not so deep.

138
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,252
I think we should stop.

139
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,562
What a shame...

140
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,040
I'll use my mouth.

141
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,452
Is that you, Nami?

142
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:34,355
Come on down.

143
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,640
Drink up.

144
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,858
Let me see.

145
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,767
Pull off the blanket.

146
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,872
God, I love this smell.

147
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:38,859
The Second Sex

148
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:52,142
- That'll be all.
- Yes, ma'am.

149
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,250
Ms. Lee?

150
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:01,254
Thank you.

151
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:17,865
Bye honey.

152
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:29,837
Not so hard.

153
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:34,640
Your eyes seem so desperate
to find your baby.

154
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:39,347
Your eyes, pure like diamonds
and sharp like sapphire.

155
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:43,357
Now, shed your tears
into the lake.

156
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:46,555
I will take only your eyes.

157
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:51,766
Then I will bring you to the other
side of the lake, to your baby.

158
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,259
The young mother sighs
in desperation.

159
00:32:56,939 --> 00:33:00,170
If I can only save my baby
from death...

160
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:03,136
Of course
I will give you my eyes.

161
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:07,339
The mother starts shedding
tears into the lake.

162
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,951
Look at the picture.

163
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:22,457
I love how you're such
a nice girl.

164
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:27,063
You're not bad-tempered,
you're polite to me.

165
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:30,862
I learned that from Father.

166
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:33,840
He said
to treat people politely.

167
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,640
It may seem like a sign
of respect,

168
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,648
but it's really putting
myself first.

169
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:50,252
You're lucky to have a father
who teaches you things like that.

170
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:13,838
Open the door wide
tonight, please.

171
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,551
Yes, Miss.

172
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:33,263
It's so late.
You don't have to do that.

173
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:48,344
Congratulations on your son.

174
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,645
Thank you, sir.

175
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,742
You must be tired.

176
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,543
I'm fine, sir.

177
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,553
I'm going to cum.

178
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,061
Can I do it inside you?

179
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:52,463
Please don't.

180
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:56,461
Then let me cum
in your mouth.

181
00:37:57,739 --> 00:37:58,865
Yes!

182
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,440
Not now.

183
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,544
Suck it hard
when I put it in.

184
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:08,946
What?

185
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:13,151
Suck it like a straw.

186
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:14,654
I'll try.

187
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:39,239
I'm so scared.

188
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:42,840
What are you scared of?

189
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,353
I'm terrified.

190
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:56,362
Now, in your mouth!

191
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,862
- Where is it?
- Here!

192
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,251
Take it.

193
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:18,471
You!

194
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:21,230
Let's eat.

195
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,760
Wow.

196
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,259
They're kicking hard.

197
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,341
You're impatient to come out?

198
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:10,453
They're moving around.

199
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:14,056
You two are so lively!

200
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,763
You get up in the morning

201
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:30,269
and think of
what you have to endure...

202
00:43:30,338 --> 00:43:33,466
and damn,
it makes your gut hurt.

203
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:36,633
But what can you do?

204
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:43,140
Just breathe in deep,
and transform into a cold stone.

205
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,151
Sorry I can't be warmer to you.

206
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:03,768
This job is R.U.N.S.

207
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:07,337
What?

208
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,838
Revolting, ugly, nauseating,
and shameless.

209
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:21,045
I wasted my whole life
in this place.

210
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:23,454
How long do you plan
to do this?

211
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:27,961
I like this job.

212
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,665
You got a man?
You're still in good shape.

213
00:44:35,937 --> 00:44:39,873
Aren't I?
I still got it, huh?

214
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:45,135
Are you dating or not?

215
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,647
Out there,
the world's full of men.

216
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:51,552
But no one's really
worth my time.

217
00:44:57,925 --> 00:44:58,949
That's true.

218
00:45:20,415 --> 00:45:24,442
She used to eat
the stinkiest kimchi...

219
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:26,944
But now she won't
even touch it.

220
00:45:27,021 --> 00:45:29,751
She can't keep her food down.

221
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:31,951
And her breasts seem swollen.

222
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:35,052
I know how sharp you are.

223
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:37,962
So I asked her off guard,
but she doesn't have a man.

224
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,768
I'm pretty sure of it, ma'am.

225
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:46,170
So she doesn't even realize
she's pregnant yet?

226
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:49,232
Well, she's kind of
on the slow side...

227
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:51,143
Slow?

228
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:53,738
Really?

229
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:57,548
What do you think
she'll do when she finds out?

230
00:45:57,618 --> 00:45:59,745
Slow, or naive...

231
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:04,749
She's not completely stupid,
but she won't pull any tricks.

232
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,354
She's pure-hearted.

233
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:11,662
Like Dostoyevsky's Idiot?

234
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,966
Your daughter got mad
at me for coming here.

235
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,943
Like she can do anything
without me.

236
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:29,247
I heard your son
got appointed to prosecutor.

237
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:32,443
Truly amazing, huh?

238
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:36,151
Thank you.
It's all thanks to you.

239
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:37,857
What do you mean?

240
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:41,457
It's a personal triumph for you.

241
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,458
A personal triumph.

242
00:46:44,832 --> 00:46:46,959
Your boss came in naked

243
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:49,366
and you didn't even resist?

244
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:53,839
I was naked, too,
and waiting for him.

245
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:56,536
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:01,038
So, is it any different
with a rich man?

247
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:08,755
He finished with that.

248
00:47:08,823 --> 00:47:12,054
Guess it is different.

249
00:47:14,128 --> 00:47:18,565
Are you going to keep working
in that house?

250
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:20,466
Yes.

251
00:47:21,235 --> 00:47:23,863
Isn't it uncomfortable
being around his wife?

252
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,939
It's like nothing
really happened.

253
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,737
But it did happen.
You can't change that.

254
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,737
Bye, Mom.

255
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,934
I won't be coming anymore.

256
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:20,951
Why call in someone else
to do the cleaning?

257
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,954
Just have her do it bit by bit.

258
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,465
She won't be too busy
until the twins are born.

259
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:28,866
That damn thing!

260
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,837
My god, Mom!

261
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:36,934
Stay calm, don't panic.

262
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:39,342
Mom, do something!

263
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:40,243
Don't move!

264
00:48:40,314 --> 00:48:42,748
Ma'am?
Please grab my leg.

265
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:43,841
Grandma! Hurry!

266
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:45,351
Nami, you stay still.

267
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:06,366
Mom! Are you crazy?

268
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,531
Shut up
if you don't know anything.

269
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:16,645
She just has
a slight concussion.

270
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:20,153
But she feels pain in her pelvis
so we'll do some tests.

271
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:22,451
She fell from the second floor?

272
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:24,347
She's very lucky.

273
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,059
Your husband's fucking her,
and she's pregnant.

274
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,965
That's a fact.

275
00:49:35,937 --> 00:49:39,270
The possibility that the baby's
not your husband's?

276
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,272
Zero.

277
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:45,042
So you pulled that shit
in front of Nami?

278
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:48,347
I can't believe you.

279
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:50,449
What shit?

280
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,755
That was just an accident.

281
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,057
Yes?

282
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,463
She has a concussion,
bruised pelvis,

283
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:09,764
and some abrasions.

284
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:12,865
They're all pretty minor.

285
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,841
She just needs a couple days rest.

286
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,344
That's not what I want to know.

287
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:22,044
The doctor didn't mention that.

288
00:50:22,116 --> 00:50:23,845
And she didn't discharge
any blood.

289
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:26,443
Tough as a weed, that girl...

290
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,047
The doctors did all that testing
and didn't find out she's pregnant?

291
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,152
It's still too early
to tell, ma'am.

292
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:36,162
You sure you
didn't make a mistake?

293
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:41,163
Fine! Calm her down
and come back.

294
00:50:41,736 --> 00:50:42,668
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,773
I heard Hoon's going abroad
on business.

296
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:48,631
Just hold on for tonight.

297
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:53,740
I'll take care of everything
before he gets back.

298
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:59,343
Mother, I want to be alone.

299
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:06,357
With a rich husband, cheating
is just part of the package.

300
00:51:48,636 --> 00:51:50,866
Hae-ra's mother says
she's really sorry.

301
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:54,633
She says to rest up
and not worry about anything.

302
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,744
It must've been heavy.

303
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:03,149
Your consolation payment.

304
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,148
You know this is how that family
solves any problems, right?

305
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:18,464
Convenient for them.
And not bad for us either.

306
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:21,066
Get some rest.

307
00:52:57,938 --> 00:52:59,166
Mrs. Cho!

308
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:14,649
Do you still see me as

309
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:17,054
that helpless little
high school girl?

310
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,250
Of course not, ma'am.

311
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:19,558
In that case,

312
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:24,359
How dare you gossip
about my husband

313
00:53:24,431 --> 00:53:26,661
behind my back to outsiders?

314
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:30,661
Outsiders?
How am I an outsider?

315
00:53:30,738 --> 00:53:31,762
Mom!

316
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,466
My deepest apologies, ma'am.

317
00:53:34,108 --> 00:53:36,338
It won't happen again.

318
00:53:42,316 --> 00:53:43,943
Hello, Mother.

319
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:45,645
Hi.

320
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:51,348
- Hae-ra is edgy.
- These days she always is.

321
00:54:00,134 --> 00:54:02,159
I don't see
the young maid today.

322
00:54:03,537 --> 00:54:06,267
I sent her to the hospital.
She's not feeling well, sir.

323
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:08,233
This late?

324
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:13,341
They admitted her for the night.

325
00:54:14,615 --> 00:54:16,549
Oh really?

326
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:19,044
She'll be back tomorrow, sir.

327
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,546
Mrs. Cho?

328
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:23,656
Why are you chattering
on this late at night?

329
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:26,454
With that annoying voice
of yours.

330
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:33,664
And why does it take you hours
to pack a suitcase?

331
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,564
Is it because you're old?

332
00:54:44,712 --> 00:54:45,940
I am the mother...

333
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,845
of a prosecutor
of the Republic of Korea!

334
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,152
Revolting, ugly,
nauseating, and shameless!

335
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:06,065
R.U.N.S.

336
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:07,866
R.U.N.S.

337
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:12,067
R.U.N.S!

338
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:18,141
- Here's Ms. Lee Eun-yi.
- Thank you.

339
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:25,051
We didn't notice it at first.

340
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,144
See this?

341
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:29,348
The fertilized egg
implanted in your womb?

342
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:34,854
You're pregnant.
Looks like about four weeks.

343
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:43,164
It's a blessing to be pregnant.

344
00:55:44,238 --> 00:55:45,865
Be brave.

345
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,633
Was it your boss?

346
00:55:51,812 --> 00:55:56,442
You'll spend all your savings
giving birth and raising the baby.

347
00:55:57,718 --> 00:56:00,448
But I guess savings are meant
to be spent in times like this.

348
00:56:01,322 --> 00:56:04,450
Maybe there's some sort
of government support?

349
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,451
Is it your boss' baby?

350
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:13,664
I mean, he's rich and all.

351
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:16,966
Have you ever had an abortion?

352
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:25,145
You should pack up and get out
of that house now.

353
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:26,338
Abortion or not.

354
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:28,745
Then what?

355
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:33,850
Then what?
You can think about that later.

356
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:37,552
Your baby's not going anywhere.

357
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:42,356
Thank you.

358
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:47,061
There are obstetrics tests
listed on the hospital bill.

359
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:51,060
Now, she knows she's pregnant.

360
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,732
Let's see what

361
00:56:54,808 --> 00:56:57,333
that bimbo tries to pull.

362
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:04,343
What did he see in that cheap,
common slut?

363
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,152
I should've pushed her
from someplace higher

364
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:11,555
and ended things.

365
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,058
Damn it.

366
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:03,239
I'm sorry, Eun-yi.

367
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,336
I can't believe
I made a mistake like that.

368
00:58:06,413 --> 00:58:07,641
You understand, right?

369
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:08,646
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,444
Your friend got you
some herbal medicine?

371
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:12,647
I should've done that.

372
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,949
No, I'm fine, ma'am.
I'll be up again soon.

373
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:19,652
I'm late for work.

374
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:21,459
Bye.

375
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:31,161
Drink that lying down.
Go on. Lie down.

376
00:58:42,716 --> 00:58:45,844
How could that bastard
do this to me?

377
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,049
In my house, with the bitch
who washes my underwear.

378
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:52,758
You made her
wash your underwear?

379
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:57,763
No need for you to resent Hoon.

380
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:06,268
From the day he was born,
he had everything he ever wanted.

381
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:12,742
Whatever he saw,
if he wanted it, it was his.

382
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:13,939
No matter what.

383
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:18,143
All the men
in that family are like that.

384
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,445
Look at your mother-in-law.

385
00:59:22,823 --> 00:59:25,553
She suffered through
such awful things

386
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:28,157
because of those guys.

387
00:59:28,228 --> 00:59:30,355
Normal people can't
even imagine it.

388
00:59:32,032 --> 00:59:35,968
But she endured it all
to become who she is today.

389
00:59:37,738 --> 00:59:40,639
And look at her now.

390
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:44,836
Everyone worships the ground
she walks on.

391
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:49,145
You'll be like that, too.

392
00:59:49,216 --> 00:59:51,650
And your children
will be like Hoon.

393
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,047
That's what both you and
I want, isn't it?

394
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:04,960
Let him sleep
around all he wants.

395
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:10,970
Later, you can enjoy yourself
and live like a queen.

396
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:21,558
You know...

397
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:26,563
This house is kind of scary.

398
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:28,239
Why?

399
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:32,842
Last night...

400
01:02:35,015 --> 01:02:36,141
What about last night?

401
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:42,247
Had a nightmare?

402
01:02:47,127 --> 01:02:50,255
I think I'd better
quit working here.

403
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,134
Then pack up now and go.

404
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,443
But until
they find someone else...

405
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:06,638
Look.

406
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:11,047
No one in this family will care
that you're gone.

407
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:12,142
Just go.

408
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:18,650
- But I Should tell them...
- Just cut the bullshit and leave.

409
01:03:34,908 --> 01:03:37,240
What if she shows up

410
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:40,438
One day with her baby?

411
01:03:41,014 --> 01:03:44,040
You think a few million dollars
would solve the problem?

412
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:49,346
She'll hinder you for life,

413
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:53,153
and be a thorn in the side
of Nami and the twins, too.

414
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:55,760
You should deal with it now.

415
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,965
Make her get rid of it
before it's too late.

416
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:08,740
Come in.

417
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:13,436
Sit down.

418
01:04:18,618 --> 01:04:20,950
I'm sorry to say this

419
01:04:21,321 --> 01:04:23,551
But something came up.

420
01:04:24,224 --> 01:04:26,055
What is it?

421
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:31,759
It's a family matter.

422
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,365
What are you doing?

423
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:51,546
I said, what are you doing?

424
01:04:55,121 --> 01:05:01,253
I treated you
humanely and nicely.

425
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:04,954
Didn't I?

426
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:23,038
I'm sorry, ma'am.

427
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,453
About what?

428
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,361
I'll see myself out.

429
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:45,063
Stay right there, please.

430
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:47,229
I apologize.

431
01:05:48,508 --> 01:05:50,237
For what?

432
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:00,345
Mother?

433
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:03,650
Sit up straight.

434
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,960
Let's go get an abortion.

435
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:18,161
Then you can take this and leave.

436
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:21,739
Then we'll all go back
to living in peace.

437
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:27,039
That's a $100,000 check.

438
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:34,048
That thing inside you,
it's nothing.

439
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,557
You can just cut it off,
like a cyst.

440
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:43,156
Think wisely.

441
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:47,557
But how did you all know?

442
01:06:49,936 --> 01:06:54,635
I'll give you a few days,

443
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:58,444
But you won't get your way, ever.

444
01:07:23,837 --> 01:07:26,772
She's been so affectionate
to the kids in my stomach.

445
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:29,331
So her own kid...

446
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:36,849
She won't give up the baby
for all the money in the world.

447
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:39,248
Never.

448
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:53,458
Stupid! Imbecile!

449
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:11,443
I should've thought of Madam...

450
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:14,846
I did a horrible thing.

451
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:19,053
It's her husband
who should've thought of her.

452
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:28,364
Did the hospital tell them
I am pregnant?

453
01:08:40,513 --> 01:08:43,539
If you want more money, ask.
They'll pay.

454
01:08:44,017 --> 01:08:46,247
And forget the baby.

455
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:53,657
Look.

456
01:08:55,028 --> 01:08:58,054
Do you really want to have
this baby and bring it up?

457
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:02,562
I'm not sure.

458
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,246
Why'd you just stand still
and let her slap you like that?

459
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:19,749
I'm sorry.

460
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:23,846
Don't be sorry!
Damn!

461
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:46,544
You're still awake?

462
01:09:48,014 --> 01:09:52,144
You sleep first, tonight.
I'll watch over you.

463
01:10:09,936 --> 01:10:11,062
I'm sorry.

464
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:14,237
About what?

465
01:10:15,308 --> 01:10:18,436
Grandma pushing the ladder
on purpose.

466
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:25,841
I saw it.

467
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:37,854
It was an accident
because of the vacuum cleaner.

468
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:53,836
You're a good person.
I feel bad.

469
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,241
Herbal medicine

470
01:12:13,526 --> 01:12:15,357
- Mrs. Cho!
- Yes?

471
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,060
Tell her
to move out of this room.

472
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:21,157
Pardon?

473
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:25,163
Put her in your room
and keep an eye on her.

474
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:07,238
Why did you move to this room?

475
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,744
A new nanny will come.

476
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:19,550
Why? Are you sick?

477
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,354
It's not that.

478
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:25,454
There's a baby
inside my tummy, too.

479
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:28,967
Is it a boy or a girl?

480
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:34,538
I hope it's a girl like you.

481
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:36,739
I'm not sure yet.

482
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:40,536
It's still too small, right?

483
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:47,945
Nami...

484
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:49,353
Yes?

485
01:13:51,424 --> 01:13:52,356
Nami...

486
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:01,462
Nami?
Your mother's waiting.

487
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:03,261
Bye, Eun-yi.

488
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:15,740
I hope you deliver safely.

489
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:18,545
- Where were you?
- Never mind.

490
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:27,450
Keep an eye on that woman.

491
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:28,859
Yes.

492
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:53,744
What a relief!

493
01:14:57,123 --> 01:14:58,954
Liberation!

494
01:15:29,622 --> 01:15:31,055
Madam Cho?

495
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:43,869
I'm having this baby.

496
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:53,337
Go ahead.

497
01:16:09,328 --> 01:16:11,455
Hello, Mother.
Thank you for being here.

498
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:15,667
Right on time
despite being so busy.

499
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:16,861
Go on in.

500
01:16:47,133 --> 01:16:48,566
Let's eat.

501
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:57,134
They even took my cell phone.

502
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,352
Sit.

503
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:22,158
What do they think
they can do to my baby?

504
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:27,833
These people are scary.

505
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:31,233
I'm scared something awful
might happen to you.

506
01:18:12,718 --> 01:18:13,742
Bravo.

507
01:18:18,624 --> 01:18:19,955
Well done, my sweetie.

508
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:24,057
Thank you, honey.

509
01:18:40,112 --> 01:18:41,044
Get some rest.

510
01:18:41,814 --> 01:18:43,941
I'll go change and come back.

511
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,755
Son of a bitch.

512
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:58,853
That's enough, okay?
Stop there.

513
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:03,966
After these precious
angels were just born...

514
01:20:21,814 --> 01:20:24,647
My stomach.

515
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,963
I don't need anything.

516
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:09,451
Damn bitch.
How dare she!

517
01:21:43,128 --> 01:21:44,356
Oops.

518
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:48,065
What are you doing there?

519
01:21:49,735 --> 01:21:51,760
I was feeling under the weather.

520
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:55,134
Wanna join me?

521
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,943
As you wish...

522
01:22:01,413 --> 01:22:03,244
Were the twins born?

523
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:06,341
What's wrong with you?

524
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:12,650
I'm pregnant.

525
01:22:23,135 --> 01:22:25,968
But the ladies of the house
found out everything.

526
01:22:30,309 --> 01:22:32,334
They really smacked me around.

527
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:37,644
They said they'd give me
$100,000 if I have an abortion.

528
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:45,856
But I'm having this baby.

529
01:22:48,627 --> 01:22:50,458
What are you doing in there?

530
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:53,755
Get out of there, now!

531
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:14,449
I know you don't
even think of me as human.

532
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,952
But this baby is yours!

533
01:23:37,509 --> 01:23:42,742
No! Don't do this!
No, baby!

534
01:24:23,222 --> 01:24:27,056
I'll just disappear quietly
and live with my baby.

535
01:24:28,627 --> 01:24:32,358
I couldn't hurt anyone,
and I don't need money.

536
01:24:35,134 --> 01:24:36,965
You're the father.

537
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:41,736
This is your baby, too.

538
01:24:43,008 --> 01:24:44,236
Calm down, Ms. Lee.

539
01:24:48,313 --> 01:24:50,543
Let's have the baby, okay?

540
01:24:59,124 --> 01:25:00,955
Thank you, Mr. Goh.

541
01:25:02,327 --> 01:25:04,955
Sorry for getting pregnant
from someone like you.

542
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,747
She was squirming in such pain,

543
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:32,757
I gave her
a shot of something strong.

544
01:25:32,825 --> 01:25:34,053
Good work.

545
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:37,561
The men in this family
are really something.

546
01:25:39,331 --> 01:25:40,958
- See you.
- Bye.

547
01:25:41,633 --> 01:25:43,760
Pack her things
and send her out.

548
01:25:43,836 --> 01:25:45,861
Don't let her back here, ever.

549
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:46,870
Yes, ma'am.

550
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,539
Mr. Goh wants to see you.

551
01:25:52,311 --> 01:25:54,142
- Me?
- Yes.

552
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:57,942
- He saw her?
- Yes, ma'am.

553
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,335
Is the baby dead? Completely?

554
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:26,935
Hmm?

555
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:34,546
Oh, it seems she fooled around
and came in pregnant.

556
01:26:36,722 --> 01:26:38,747
Why do you even care?

557
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:42,453
Ma'am!
I'll ask the questions.

558
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:49,262
The baby's completely erased?

559
01:26:50,235 --> 01:26:51,167
Yes.

560
01:26:54,706 --> 01:26:56,333
She said it was my baby.

561
01:26:56,608 --> 01:26:57,734
Who says?

562
01:27:05,117 --> 01:27:09,747
She'd say anything to try
to rip some money off us.

563
01:27:15,327 --> 01:27:19,161
If it wasn't mine,
why go through all the trouble?

564
01:27:22,434 --> 01:27:24,061
Did you slip her some poison?

565
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,164
It wasn't me.

566
01:27:28,106 --> 01:27:29,232
Then who was it?

567
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:32,943
Your daughter?

568
01:27:38,617 --> 01:27:42,144
Sorry.
It was me.

569
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:44,553
Are you completely insane?

570
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:48,152
This is a real shock to me.

571
01:27:50,329 --> 01:27:52,957
It's my child.

572
01:27:54,132 --> 01:27:57,966
How dare you
think you can do that?

573
01:27:58,036 --> 01:28:00,163
Who has the nerve!

574
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:09,537
Look.

575
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:14,149
Is it not my child if your daughter
doesn't give birth to it?

576
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:16,853
Is that it?

577
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:24,960
No, course not.

578
01:28:52,924 --> 01:28:54,551
Did you get a signature?

579
01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:56,753
Just do it.
It's an emergency.

580
01:29:17,716 --> 01:29:20,549
Isn't that woman outside
her mother?

581
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:25,348
No. It's no one.

582
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:59,552
It was probably
Hae-ra who did it.

583
01:30:03,628 --> 01:30:08,361
Scary people.
Probably why they're so rich.

584
01:30:11,436 --> 01:30:12,869
Nami said...

585
01:30:15,307 --> 01:30:19,243
She saw her grandmother push me
from the second floor.

586
01:30:20,312 --> 01:30:25,750
She apologized, and said
she felt sorry for me.

587
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,354
Kids don't lie.

588
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:34,453
But I didn't even know
I was pregnant then!

589
01:30:37,829 --> 01:30:39,160
I did.

590
01:30:40,132 --> 01:30:45,263
Nothing goes on in that house
without me knowing.

591
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:48,237
I knew everything.

592
01:30:56,515 --> 01:31:03,853
When you came home
from the hospital,

593
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:06,049
your baby's fate was decided.

594
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:08,256
Even if I hadn't told them...

595
01:31:17,035 --> 01:31:18,059
I'm sorry.

596
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,339
I'm ashamed.

597
01:31:30,315 --> 01:31:31,247
But a woman like me...

598
01:31:33,518 --> 01:31:35,247
It's in my bones.

599
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:02,838
Take this
and find someone nice.

600
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:08,753
You'll be fine,
you have a good heart.

601
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:23,158
I'm going to get revenge.

602
01:32:25,036 --> 01:32:28,335
I know.
Anyone would want to.

603
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:37,241
No! However small,
I have to do something!

604
01:33:03,008 --> 01:33:05,636
Damned world has been
so cruel to me.

605
01:33:07,812 --> 01:33:14,342
You poor thing.
I'll apologize for them. Happy?

606
01:33:19,324 --> 01:33:22,157
Their daughter, Nami...

607
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:27,264
She was genuinely nice to me.

608
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:30,367
Stop thinking about it.

609
01:33:32,537 --> 01:33:36,234
I wanted to have a pretty little
daughter like her.

610
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,141
A girl who's kind to me.

611
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:44,138
Wipe those thoughts
from your head.

612
01:33:51,022 --> 01:33:53,855
I smell like the restaurant,
don't I?

613
01:33:56,027 --> 01:33:57,051
No.

614
01:33:57,929 --> 01:34:06,268
Go to sleep.
And forget it ever happened.

615
01:34:17,816 --> 01:34:22,048
R.U.N.S., R.U.N.S.

616
01:34:51,516 --> 01:34:53,848
We haven't done it for ages.

617
01:34:58,223 --> 01:34:59,952
You're unclean.

618
01:35:00,925 --> 01:35:01,755
Me?

619
01:35:02,427 --> 01:35:04,554
Put your hand
on your heart and think.

620
01:35:15,006 --> 01:35:18,737
All right. Still, tell me

621
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:20,937
when you're ready for
our 4th and 5th kids.

622
01:36:38,823 --> 01:36:39,755
Mom!

623
01:36:42,827 --> 01:36:44,351
What the hell
are you doing here?

624
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:46,363
What the hell
are you doing here?

625
01:36:56,207 --> 01:36:59,040
- Leave the baby alone.
- Leave the baby alone.

626
01:37:13,324 --> 01:37:16,259
- Go, go!
- I'm going!

627
01:37:16,327 --> 01:37:17,555
- Honey!
- Honey!

628
01:37:17,629 --> 01:37:19,460
- Honey!
- Honey!

629
01:37:21,232 --> 01:37:22,358
What's going on?

630
01:37:23,134 --> 01:37:25,659
She's crazy!

631
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:31,639
Mrs. Cho?
How did that bimbo get in here?

632
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:33,341
Who let her in?

633
01:37:33,411 --> 01:37:35,345
Kick her out, now.

634
01:37:35,413 --> 01:37:37,745
Call the men
if you can't do it alone.

635
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:41,745
I quit.
I'm leaving this house, now.

636
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,947
What's this all of a sudden?

637
01:37:44,022 --> 01:37:47,253
I'm already packed to go.

638
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:50,754
Where do you get the nerve?

639
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:54,865
Chase that crazy bitch out
before you go!

640
01:37:56,334 --> 01:37:58,666
Never shut up, do you?

641
01:37:59,737 --> 01:38:02,331
From now on, if you want
something do it yourselves.

642
01:38:02,407 --> 01:38:03,931
I quit.

643
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:08,142
What are you doing,
Mrs. Cho!

644
01:38:08,213 --> 01:38:11,046
What the hell are you doing?

645
01:38:11,115 --> 01:38:12,742
You really want
to live like this?

646
01:38:16,721 --> 01:38:19,053
This is what these people
are like.

647
01:38:19,624 --> 01:38:20,750
Just ignore her.

648
01:38:20,825 --> 01:38:21,951
Eun-yi!

649
01:38:23,828 --> 01:38:26,763
Nami, how have you been?

650
01:38:26,831 --> 01:38:29,061
Okay. What about you?

651
01:38:30,635 --> 01:38:31,761
You must be so happy

652
01:38:31,836 --> 01:38:34,532
to have two angelic
little brothers.

653
01:38:34,606 --> 01:38:35,834
It's so-so.

654
01:38:37,909 --> 01:38:40,139
What about the baby
inside your tummy?

655
01:38:41,412 --> 01:38:42,436
My baby?

656
01:38:43,514 --> 01:38:44,742
It died.

657
01:38:45,116 --> 01:38:46,140
Why?

658
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:02,959
Eun-yi?

659
01:39:04,235 --> 01:39:05,566
Don't do it.

660
01:39:05,937 --> 01:39:07,427
Walk out of here with me.

661
01:39:07,805 --> 01:39:10,933
I can't get it out of my head...

662
01:39:11,009 --> 01:39:13,034
what happened here.

663
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:15,242
It's so horrible...

664
01:39:17,815 --> 01:39:20,750
I can't take it anymore.
That's why.

665
01:39:21,419 --> 01:39:22,545
Ms. Lee.

666
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:29,155
I apologize for what happened.
I'll settle with you as needed.

667
01:39:29,827 --> 01:39:31,454
You know me.

668
01:39:36,634 --> 01:39:39,967
Nami.
Thank you for everything.

669
01:39:40,538 --> 01:39:43,939
I'm sorry to you,
and the twins.

670
01:39:45,009 --> 01:39:46,943
Don't forget me!
Promise!

671
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:48,239
What's she doing?

672
01:40:03,928 --> 01:40:04,860
Fire!

673
01:40:06,431 --> 01:40:09,264
Oh my fucking god!

674
01:40:21,512 --> 01:40:22,945
Let's get out of here!

675
01:41:23,808 --> 01:41:25,036
Hey, Nami!

676
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:29,236
Come on up here!

677
01:41:40,925 --> 01:41:42,256
Recognize it?

678
01:41:44,228 --> 01:41:45,456
Roberto.

679
01:41:46,831 --> 01:41:47,957
It's yours.

680
01:41:48,633 --> 01:41:49,565
Thanks, pa.

681
01:41:49,634 --> 01:41:52,262
My pleasure, baby.

682
01:41:54,205 --> 01:42:00,041
Happy birthday to you,

683
01:42:01,012 --> 01:42:06,951
Happy birthday to you.

684
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:15,655
Happy birthday
my precious girl,

685
01:42:17,028 --> 01:42:22,466
Happy birthday to you.

686
01:42:24,836 --> 01:42:26,963
Happy birthday...

687
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,051
Cheers.
