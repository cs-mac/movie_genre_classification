1
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,163
- Bless you.
- It's freezing in here.

2
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,883
- Look at that green thumb.
- I wish.

3
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,446
- How's your sinuses?
- Better.

4
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,661
Should be home by 7:00.

5
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:19,190
Can you call the landscapers again
about the sod?

6
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,896
- They gotta get moving on that.
- I'll try them again.

7
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,403
Thanks, honey.

8
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,541
Maybe it's the couch.

9
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,050
Great!

10
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,937
We were thinking...

11
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,438
in here.

12
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,043
With the...

13
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:06,941
coming-out part...

14
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,777
along the wall?

15
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,183
- Sure.
- And I guess come in...

16
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:13,515
through there.

17
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,386
Not through there.

18
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,891
- Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

19
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,258
Push. Four more.

20
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,731
Three. Two.

21
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,564
Now reach up to the corner.

22
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:30,866
Nice. Good stretch, Bev.

23
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,874
Four more. Three. Two.
Sasha, here we go.

24
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,847
Let's smile, ladies!

25
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,813
I just eventually found
the whole 12-step thing...

26
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,861
was like just another
form of addiction.

27
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:57,261
That's exactly
what this book is saying.

28
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:00,266
It's about how to own
your own life.

29
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:04,600
What he's saying is,
we don't really own our own lives.

30
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:08,438
We're taught what to do and think,
but emotionally we're not in charge.

31
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,138
Yeah, but I think that
with the exercise...

32
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:14,943
and the diet and healthy foods...

33
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:18,008
I just think he's very good
at certain things.

34
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,780
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,186
- Have you read him, Carol?
- No.

36
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,690
He's very good
on certain things:

37
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,727
Emotional maintenance...

38
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,728
stress management...

39
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:32,498
Carol, you do not sweat.

40
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:35,225
I hate you.

41
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,395
I know. It's true.

42
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,032
No! It's great.

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,014
- Did you forget?
- No. It's inside.

44
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,855
- I just...
- What?

45
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,222
Something happened.

46
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,731
Come in.

47
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,444
How old was he?

48
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:22,548
Five years older.

49
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,848
He was the oldest
of my mom's kids.

50
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,463
It...

51
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,499
wasn't...

52
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,205
That's what everyone keeps...

53
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,808
Not at all.

54
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,042
Because he wasn't married.

55
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,551
Right.

56
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,627
It's just so unreal.

57
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:22,571
- Did you see the den?
- At your party. It's gorgeous.

58
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:25,578
I'm suing the contractor.
Did I tell you?

59
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,083
You don't even want to know.

60
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,283
Fulvia!

61
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,913
I'm home!

62
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,541
Hi, Mother.

63
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,741
What? No.
I just walked in the door.

64
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,250
That's all right.

65
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,982
How's your back?

66
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,056
That's good.

67
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,458
It's not a bad time.
I just...

68
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,793
All right. That's fine.

69
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:19,560
He's fine.

70
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,066
They're fine.

71
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,702
I will.

72
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,205
I will, Mother.

73
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,510
I'll talk to you soon.

74
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:37,617
Good-bye.

75
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,118
Fulvia!

76
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,929
Any <i>telefono</i>
while I was gone?

77
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,101
Oh, my God.

78
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:05,845
Is this what they delivered?

79
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:17,386
We did not order black.

80
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,052
This is not what we ordered.

81
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:30,499
In Sherman Oaks, may I have the number
for Nelson's on Riverside?

82
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,931
I don't believe this.

83
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,744
Thank you.

84
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,923
May I have the delivery depar...
Thank you.

85
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,018
- Mom?
- What, Rory?

86
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,753
Soccer practice. Don't forget.

87
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:30,024
- I didn't forget last time.
- Whatever. I gotta go.

88
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:32,395
It was a mix-up.

89
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,899
Good-bye, honey.

90
00:11:57,124 --> 00:12:00,116
Where is my book?
My telephone book?

91
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:03,395
I put it in the bottom shelf.

92
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,489
Because of the cabinet men.

93
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,033
I see. Thanks.

94
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,883
Fulvia, could I have some milk?

95

It's okay. Thanks.

109
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,357
- Oh, that purse is adorable.
- Thank you.

110
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,864
- How's your little girl?
- She's fine.

111
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,060

- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

113
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,872
No, we wanted teal.

114
00:13:56,944 --> 00:14:00,038
We ordered teal,
but we received black.

115
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:02,207
But your original order
shows black.

116
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:06,218
That's impossible because
it doesn't go with anything we have.

117
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,054
All right.

118
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,053
All right, let me try
the Sherman Oaks store upstairs.

119
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,792
- I'll see what they have in stock.
- Thank you.

Right.
Maybe you should try it.

158
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,927
It'd be a lot of fun.
We could do it together.

159
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,800
Come on.
Why don't you just try it?

160
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,895
Do you know what you want?

161
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:09,464
I'll have the fruit salad
and the herbal iced tea.

162
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,379
And for you?

163
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,915
I'll have the same.

164
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:26,615
I got one.

165
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:31,187
This beautiful, shapely blonde
runs into the emergency room...

166
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,290
and when they ask her
what's wrong, she says...

167
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:39,304
"It's kind of embarrassing, but I was
using my vibrator and it got stuck.

168
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,340
I can't get it out."

169
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:45,970
So they admit her
and rush her to the operating room.

170
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:50,710
They get some specialist to perform
the surgery; it's a ten-hour ordeal.

171
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,719
Finally she wakes up
the next day...

172
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:58,918
and the specialist walks in and says,
"I got good news and bad news.

173
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,822
The bad news is,
we did everything we could...

174
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:08,493
we tried everything, but we just
couldn't get the darn thing out.

175
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,503
But the good news is...

176
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:14,005
we were able
to change the batteries."

177
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,382
Somebody doesn't seem
to like your jokes, Ted.

178
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:31,390
Excuse me. I don't...

179
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,993
Sorry.

180
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,701
I'm so sorry, Greg.

181
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,178
You're overexerted, I guess.

182
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,016
I've never...

183
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:04,223
Maybe the doctor can
give you something for it.

184
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,873
I really don't see anything
wrong with you, Carol.

185
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,240
I mean, outside of a slight rash
and some congestion.

186
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,877
I'll give you some ointment...

187
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,543
and some decongestant, but...

188
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,253
I don't know what else to do.

189
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:38,917
Are you... well, what?

190
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,389
I guess I'm just
a little stressed out lately...

191
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,295
and just tired from it.

192
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,300
Well, that's not uncommon.

193
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,370
Are you doing drugs?

194
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,205
I don't take drugs or drink.

195
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:00,474
I don't even...
like coffee very much.

196
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:05,109
I'm just a total "milkaholic,"
actually.

197
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,119
I mean, before the fruit thing.

198
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:10,122
Well, stop the fruit diet.
You need protein.

199
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:13,188
And while you're at it...

200
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:15,250
try staying off dairy.

201
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:20,061
Dairy's very hard on your digestion
and hard on your intestines.

202
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:23,466
I'll see you in a couple weeks.
You'll be fine.

203
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:24,969
Thanks.

204
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,538
<i>"In the '80s there are</i>
<i>more gangs in Los Angeles...</i>

205
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:36,105
plus many more stabbings
and shootings by AK-47 s...

206
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,377
Uzis and Mac-10s...

207
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,578
killing numerous innocent people.

208
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,746
L.A. was the gang capital
of America.

209
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,120
Rapes, riots,
shooting innocent people...

210
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:48,422
slashing throats,
arms and legs being dissected...

211
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,521
were all common sights
in the black ghettos of L.A.

212
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:54,567
Today black and chicano gangs
are coming into the Valleys...

213
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,569
in mostly white areas
more and more.

214
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:01,038
That's why gangs in L.A.
Are a big American issue."

215
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,597
Good job, Rory.

216
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:06,304
- Why does it have to be so gory?
- Gory?

217
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,973
That's how it really is.
God.

218
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,986
- You want some coffee?
- I'd love some.

219
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:26,357
So, what did Hubbard
have to say?

220
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:30,369
He just said I should...

221
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,997
slow down a little,
you know...

222
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,304
stop the fruit diet,
eat less dairy.

223
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,810
That's what I said.

224
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:41,813
I knew that whole fruit thing
didn't make any sense.

225
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:46,285
But basically...

226
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:49,287
there's nothing to worry about...

227
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:51,323
aside from being
a little run-down.

228
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:52,824
That's good.

229
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,858
So...

230
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,057
Dad, how do you spell " Uzi"?

231
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:01,293
Just how it sounds.
U-Z-I.

232
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:46,072
- We doing a regular cut today?
- Yeah.

233
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:56,116
Actually I was thinking
of trying a perm for a change.

234
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,451
Perming it.

235
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,356
Liz didn't tell me
you scheduled a perm.

236
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:05,559
No, I didn't schedule one.

237
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,601
I just now thought of trying it.
Unless...

238
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,603
No, no, there's time, actually.

239
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:15,932
I had a cancellation.
You still want that manicure?

240
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,943
Sure. Thanks.

241
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,597
It's very cute on you.

242
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:22,774
Looks nice.

243
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:28,573
Oh, my God.

244
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:31,082
Paula, do you have a Kleenex?

245
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:34,617
Oh, my God.

246
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:38,756
So we meet him for lunch,
Cosford, Ted and I.

247
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:42,317
And who comes in
but this kid in shorts.

248
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:45,330
He looked like he was
aboutJonas' age.

249
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:47,059
Couldn't believe it.

250
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:50,296
Ted said I looked like
I'd seen a ghost.

251
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,306
I like what they did with your hair.
It's great. I like it.

252
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:55,807
I'm glad, honey.

253
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,112
Sexy.

254
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,022
How you feeling?

255
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:19,690
I still have this...

256
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,801
this head thing.

257
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,265
Oh, boy.

258
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:30,068
- Carol, what is going on here?
- Nothing.

259
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,340
Nobody has a fucking headache
every night of the fucking week.

260
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:53,031
- I must have a touch of something...
- I don't want to hear about it.

261
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,102
I'm sorry, I...

262
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:11,149
I know it's not normal, but...

263
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,888
I can't help it.

264
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:30,935
Good night.

265
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,183
- <i>59 degrees in Hollywood.</i>
- <i>Traffic on KNX every six minutes.</i>

266
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,658
- <i>Here's John Engel.</i>
- <i>It's been a rough morning.</i>

267
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:32,289
<i>You need patience on the Southland</i>

268
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:35,596

269
00:31:35,668 --> 00:31:38,728
<i>Hope you brought camping gear for</i>

273
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:05,930
I'm sorry, honey.

274
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,733
Me too.

275
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,158
It's okay.

276
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,298
It's okay.

277
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,039
It's all right.

278
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,744
Jesus, honey...

279
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:58,850
Take a deep breath and hold.

280
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,414
Release.

281
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:03,683
Again.

282
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:06,418
Release.

283
00:33:06,492 --> 00:33:07,754
Again.

284
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,044
- Greg, how are you?
- Good. And you?

285
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:28,239
I'm okay.
Have a seat, guys.

286
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:35,554
Basically, Carol,
you are perfectly healthy.

287
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:39,990
If anything your condition has slightly
improved since your last visit.

288
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:45,063
This is just a suggestion...

289
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,396
but you might want
to consult someone.

290
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,402
And I know
a very good doctor...

291
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,405
who's more suited
to stress-related conditions...

292
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:56,441
which I think this is.

293
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,348
- A psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

294
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,922
- Everything all right, ma'am?
- What?

295
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,423
Yeah.

296
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:05,036
What are you doing, honey?

297
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:11,876
I couldn't sleep.

298
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,409
The air. The...

299
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:16,914
The smell.

300
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,895
Clap. Slow it down.

301
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:36,992
And bring the knee up.
Pull.

302
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,765
Keep those knees up.
Tummy in. Exhale.

303
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,340
Push it out.
Here we go.

304
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,003
And right. Push left.
Right.

305
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,603
Four more. Three.

306
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,172
Good. Scoop to the right.

307
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,310
Good. Keep that leg up there.

308
00:36:59,158 --> 00:37:02,559
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just have to get somewhere.

309
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:06,257
Oh. I'll see you
at Barbara's Sunday?

310
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,698
- See you Sunday.
- Okay. Good-bye.

311
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,123
" Do you smell fumes?

312
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:35,126
Are you allergic
to the 20th century?

313
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:39,130
Do you have trouble breathing?
Are you always tired?"

314
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,033
Do you work?

315
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,591
Do you work?

316
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,932
No, I'm a house...

317
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,529
I'm a homemaker.

318
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:51,542
I'm working on some designs
for our house, though...

319
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,010
in my spare time.

320
00:37:58,117 --> 00:37:59,641
You have one child.

321
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:03,421
My husband's little boy.

322
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,458
He's not my son.
He's my stepson.

323
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,517
Rory.

324
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:11,028
He's ten.

325
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,266
How long have you
been feeling... unwell?

326
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,703
About... two months.

327
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:22,740
Three.

328
00:38:22,808 --> 00:38:25,743
I've been under
a lot of stress lately...

329
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:28,245
and then
my friend Linda and I...

330
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:31,511
She's probably my best friend.
She lives down the...

331
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:34,652
Anyway...

332
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,746
we started
this fruit diet together.

333
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:41,759
I think that
sort of set it off.

334
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,797
So...

335
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,005
- Are you uncomfortable?
- No. I...

336
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,510
I just thought...

337
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,914
I mean...

338
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,821
Aren't you supposed to
ask more questions?

339
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,525
Well... no.

340
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:20,231
We really need
to be hearing from you.

341
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,834
What's going on...

342
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,337
in you?

343
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,143
- That's so cute!
- Isn't it?

344
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,940
- That's so cute!
- Isn't it?

345
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,881
I love that little bunny.

346
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,347
I wonder what it could be.

347
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:46,013
A baby book!

348
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,820
Oh, that's beautiful!

349
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:49,326
You don't have one?

350
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:53,898
- I'm so glad.
- I love it. It's perfect.

351
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:57,766
If you need to take it back,
I won't be offended.

352
00:39:57,836 --> 00:40:00,532
Oh, no, I really love it.

353
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:05,202
You should see my baby book.
It's this disgusting puke orange.

354
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,769
- That's very appetizing, Barbara.
- I'm serious.

355
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,476
My turn.

356
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:14,314
Linda, thank you.

357
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,547
I hope you like it.

358
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,557
That's so pretty.
Did you wrap that yourself?

359
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,061
Oh! Are you kidding?
I wish I were that creative.

360
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:25,062
I've seen you wrap things.

361
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,065
I can't even
draw a straight line.

362
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,035
- Oh, I love this!
- Do you?

363
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:35,039
- It's a mobile.
- It'll look great with her crib.

364
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:37,337
Hands up. Who wants decaf?

365
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,677
Herbal tea?

366
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,348
Real coffee?

367
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:52,589
- Barbara?
- Yeah, honey.

368
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,421
Where's your bathroom?

369
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,087
Off the entrance hall
to your right.

370
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,754
Mommy!

371
00:41:56,822 --> 00:42:00,383
I heard you, Elyse! I don't know
what you should draw now!

372
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:04,486
Let Mommy have some grown-up time
with the other mommies.

373
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,794
Someone told me they heard
she was seeing a shrink.

374
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,494
I just thought you might have...

375
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,094
No. I didn't even know that...

376
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:17,506
- Is something wrong with Carol?
- No. You were just...

377
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:21,410
Because her skin looks...
Her hair looks cute but...

378
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,849
Elyse, your ice cream is melting
and Mommy is very busy!

379
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,647
- Did you get some?
- No.

380
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,654
- Do you want some?
- No.

381
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:36,719
Carol, this is yours.

382
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:41,164
You have to eat it immediately
because it's melting all over.

383
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:43,997
I shouldn't.

384
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:46,629
- What is that, honey?
- My coloring book.

385
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:48,138
Can I see?

386
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,609
She's gotten so big.

387
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,171
Barbara, this is delicious.

388
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:01,409
We haven't really talked lately.
How you doing?

389
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:05,489
Good.
I've just been a little...

390
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:08,526
- Look. It's you.
- Oh. Yeah.

391
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:11,062
Under the weather.

392
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,099
- Look, she's a princess.
- That's very good.

393
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,134
It's very realistic.

394
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:19,193
We're now opening the big present.
Please come in.

395
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,398
Okay. Here we come.

396
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:25,702
Elyse, let's go look
at the big present, okay?

397
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:31,641
- Want to sit on my lap?
- Yeah.

398
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,720
Look at this fancy wrapping.

399
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,424
You guys did too much.

400
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,431
- Come on, don't be polite.
- I'm trying.

401
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,565
A stroller!

402
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:59,074
That's exactly the one
I wanted!

403
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,545
The wheels are inside.
They go on really easily.

404
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:04,548
Even you can do it.

405
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:26,770
Mommy.

406
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,676
Carol? You all right?

407
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:40,217
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

408
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,821
Oh, my God.
Linda, what happened?

409
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,322
She can't breathe.

410
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,325
Eileen, call her house.
Someone should call her doctor.

411
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:52,420
- Jennifer, get some water, please.
- Just try to relax. Okay?

412
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,134
- Calm down.
- It's okay.

413
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:00,137
It's all going to be fine.
Just relax.

414

<i>"My name is Carol White...</i>

415
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:35,673
<i>and I live</i>
<i>in Southern California.</i>

416
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:39,177
<i>I saw your notice</i>
<i>at the health club near my house...</i>

417
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:42,941
<i>and decided to write and tell you</i>
<i>a little bit about myself.</i>

418
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:47,543
<i>For some time now</i>
<i>I have not been feeling up to par...</i>

419
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,953
<i>and was hoping your organization</i>
<i>might be of some help.</i>

420
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:54,356
<i>I'm originally from Texas...</i>

421
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:57,987
<i>although I've lived</i>
<i>in the L.A. area most of my life.</i>

422
00:45:58,063 --> 00:45:59,997
<i>I had asthma as a child...</i>

423
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:04,331
<i>but it never got in the way</i>
<i>of school or recreation.</i>

424
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:08,931
<i>I've always thought of myself as</i>
<i>having a pretty normal upbringing...</i>

425
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,238
<i>and as basically</i>
<i>a healthy person.</i>

426
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,611
<i>But for the last several months</i>
<i>that has all started to change.</i>

427
00:46:17,716 --> 00:46:20,651
<i>Suddenly I find myself</i>
<i>feeling sick</i>...<i>"</i>

428
00:46:23,455 --> 00:46:27,448
Honey, I've been calling you.
I thought you were asleep.

429
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:32,020
Someone... Brenda called about trading
Thursday carpool for Saturday.

430
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:35,032
She said you'd know
what that was about.

431
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:40,671
She said she'd call you back.

432
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:46,343
I thought you were asleep
because you weren't...

433
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:48,979
What are you doing?

434
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:51,542
I was writing this...

435
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,791
I don't even know.

436
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:15,272
Oh, God, what is this?

437
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:18,608
What?

438
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:30,187
Where am I...

439
00:47:35,127 --> 00:47:37,118
right now?

440
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:43,464
We're in our house.

441
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:50,240
Greg and Carol's house.

442
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,710
<i>Who are you?</i>

443
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:34,377
<i>You are of all ages</i>
<i>and from all walks of life.</i>

444
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,253
<i>But you find you all have</i>
<i>one thing in common: ;</i>

445
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:41,258
<i>strange, never</i>- <i>ending ailments.</i>

446
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:44,461
<i>Suddenly you can't</i>
<i>cook dinner anymore...</i>

447
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:48,488
<i>because the smell of the gas</i>
<i>from your stove makes you ill.</i>

448
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:52,901
<i>Or if you take the freeway you feel</i>
<i>as if you might choke on the fumes.</i>

449
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,907
<i>Your family and friends tell you</i>
<i>that you're overreacting...</i>

450
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,500
<i>that it's all in your head.</i>

451
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:02,069
<i>But your symptoms worsen.</i>

452
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,548
<i>Fatigue and depression</i>
<i>turn to migraines...</i>

453

<i>blackouts, even seizures.</i>

454

<i>you're not alone.</i>

456
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:17,361
<i>What you most likely are...</i>

457
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:20,694
<i>is one of a vastly growing</i>
<i>number of people who suffer...</i>

00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:22,699
<i>from environmental illness.</i>

459
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:25,998

Carol?

468

- You scared me.
- Sorry.

- No, I'm sorry.
- I just took Fulvia down.

00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:27,983
- Did you just get home?
- Yeah.

471
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,823
- So, how did it go?
- What?

472
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:32,829
Your meeting this morning.

473
00:51:34,065 --> 00:51:35,794
What was it about?

474
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:39,633
It was about getting sick on fumes
and bug sprays and stuff.

475
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:45,201
You mean, on...

476
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,369
pollution?

477
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:52,178
More about people who get sick from
chemicals, and what they do to you.

478
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,344
- Who told you to go to this?
- No, I just...

479
00:51:57,555 --> 00:51:59,580
I saw a flyer at the health club.

480
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:05,659
So you think this is
what's made you...

481
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:08,665
why you've been sick?

482
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:12,166
Because of... bug spray?

483
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:15,265
No, I... I just...

484
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:22,846
I don't know why.

485
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:52,634
Okay, that's milk
at.01 of three.

486
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,372
Usually there's a trigger...

487
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:56,471
new carpeting,
new kitchen, new car...

488
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,211
somebody works around paint fumes
or strong fragrances.

489
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,112
Okay, no reaction.

490
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:06,623
- Please prepare...
- .01 of two.

491
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,625
Right.
Then one day it hits you.

492
00:53:08,693 --> 00:53:11,753
Suddenly your body reacts to everything
around you like a Geiger counter...

493
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,695
food, air, everything.

494
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:15,926
- .01 of two, milk.
- Thank you.

495
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,731
What we're doing now is testing
about 50 separate foods and molds...

496
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:23,137
to determine what your
neutralization doses will consist of.

497
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:26,575
And then they'll...
they'll stop it?

498
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:28,578
Uh, no. Arm, please.

499
00:53:28,646 --> 00:53:32,582
Neutralization-provocation aids you
during your cleaning-up process...

500
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:35,084
but that's all it is: An aid.

501
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:37,815
This'll sting just a little bit.

502
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:41,484
<i>Dr. Reynolds, call for you on 8.</i>
<i>Dr. Reynolds, Eric Delaney on 8.</i>

503
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:46,496
Okay, that's milk at.01 of two.

504
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:47,997
Excuse me.

505
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:51,124
You okay?

506
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:55,138
Eric, Dr. Reynolds.
What's up?

507
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,708
Right.

508
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:07,980
If your oasis and twice-a-week
injections don't simmer you down...

509
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:11,317
you know you have other sensitivities,
most likely molds or fungus.

510
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,448
Continue the rare fruit diet.

511
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,962
If you don't get better
have Dr. Baines check into...

512
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:21,192
an unresolved,
controlled Candida problem.

513
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:23,962
- Dr. Reynolds, she's reacting.
- I have to go.

514
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,503
Prepare a neutralizing dose
at.01 of three.

515
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:32,202
This will cease momentarily.
I apologize for any discomfort.

516
00:54:33,278 --> 00:54:36,679
Be sure to record pulse rate change
following injection.

517
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,243
- .01 of three milligrams.
- Thank you.

518
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:57,424
Okay, we have palpitations
with deep distress...

519
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,938
in conjunction with
a racing pulse rate of 104.

520
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:03,303
There's flushing
and some wheezing.

521
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,743
Swelling in the mouth.

522
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:12,249
This is a big one, Carol.
Milk's a big one.

523
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:37,073
Have some water.

524
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:47,910
We can turn it on and off
like a switch.

525
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:50,921
We just don't know how
to make it go away.

526
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:56,561
The first thing you need to do
in order to clear...

527
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,724
The first thing you need to do
in order to clear...

528
00:55:59,797 --> 00:56:03,597
is create an oasis
in which to live.

529
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:06,660
Your oasis
is your safe place.

530
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,797
Your toxic-free zone...

531
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:12,206
where your load
has been significantly reduced.

532
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:18,774
For some that can mean an airtight,
porcelain-lined enclosure...

533
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,011
something like a refrigerator.

534
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:23,053
For others, their safe room...

535
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:27,251
is just a stripped-down room
within their house...

536
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:30,624
that's conducive
to good ventilation...

537
00:56:30,695 --> 00:56:32,424
or air control.

538
00:56:32,497 --> 00:56:37,127
My name is Sarah Pinter.
I live near a fumigation company.

539
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:42,229
We're suing the company for
improper handling of their chemicals.

540
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,041
Great.

541
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:48,044
Thank you. Yes.
Would you stand, please?

542
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:52,778
My name is
Abigail Cartier-Rousseau.

543
00:56:53,918 --> 00:56:56,819
My sensitivity originated
with fragrances.

544
00:56:56,888 --> 00:56:59,288
I was employed for 23 years.

545
00:56:59,357 --> 00:57:02,520
I've been spending some time
at the retreat in Wrenwood...

546
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:04,527
so I'm doing much better.

547
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,028
Great. Terrific.

548
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:08,531
Thank you. And you, ma'am?

549
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:19,133
My name's Carol White.
This is my husband Greg.

550
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,303
We live in
the San Fernando Valley.

551
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,485
We're here for my wife,
who's been ill...

552
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:32,546
to learn more information
and hopefully gain from it as well.

553
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:34,147
I hope so too.

554
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:36,159
<i>My doctor thinks I'm nuts.</i>

555
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:39,162
He thinks the whole thing
is completely in my head.

556
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,664
That's what my husband
still thinks.

557
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:44,896
It <i>is</i> in your head.
It's in <i>all</i> our heads.

558
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:48,905
- What do you mean, Helen?
- It makes you crazy. She's right.

559
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:53,342
It ends up in your head because
it affects the neurological.

560
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,346
And it will make you depressed.
It really will.

561
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:59,508
How does a five-year-old
say it's psychosomatic?

562
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:02,576
How does he make his eyes
swell shut?

563
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,679
I mean, why would he want
to do that?

564
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:11,024
He can't go into Chunky Cheese anymore;
he can't go into show business.

565
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:14,360
Why would he do that
to himself?

566
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:20,064
It's true; you'll go into a building,
be walking along the hall...

567
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:24,472
You don't know when that monster
is going to jump out at you.

568
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:29,036
You're just going along the wall
like any normal person.

569
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:33,209
Right. With your mask and oxygen tank
and your bottled water.

570
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:37,944
At first I didn't understand
why citrus...

571
00:58:38,022 --> 00:58:40,252
since I had tested negative
for citrus.

572
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:44,454
Then I remembered how the oranges
had rolled out of their plastic...

573
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:47,396
into the bag
with Greg's papers.

574
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:50,457
Newspapers... The ink...

575
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:52,799
- Really?
- Also... Yeah.

576
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,361
That and...

577
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,000
You know our beautiful new couch?

578
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,943
- Yeah.
- Totally toxic.

579
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:03,446
Really. Wow.

580
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:05,573
I know. So...

581
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,284
It's hard.

582
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:14,290
- I can't wear makeup anymore.
- God!

583
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:16,451
Burns my eyes. I get sick.

584
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:20,630
Well, I guess one good thing...

585
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:23,633
is how it's made you
so much more knowledgeable...

586
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:26,636
on food and chemicals
and everything.

587
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:28,433
That's true.

588
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:32,943
They know much more about it there,
the people who go through this.

589
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,443
I mean...

590
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:41,785
So much of it, too, is that
we were raised in a chemical place.

591
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:44,788
When you go into a grocery store...

592
00:59:44,856 --> 00:59:49,418
and you grab a chemical without
reading, without investigating...

593
01:00:00,872 --> 01:00:02,305
Sorry.

594
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,937
But, anyway, it's made me...

595
01:00:09,046 --> 01:00:12,743
more aware than I used to be.

596
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,751
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

597
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:21,917
<i>Next up, the load.</i>

598
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,052
<i>What is it, why is it...</i>

599
01:00:24,128 --> 01:00:26,426
<i>and what can be done</i>
<i>to improve it?</i>

600
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,830
<i>First, what is your total load?</i>

601
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:32,631
<i>Well, in the chemical</i>- <i>laden world</i>
<i>in which we live...</i>

602
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:35,069
<i>impurities are all around.</i>

603
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:38,540
<i>Everyone must deal with a certain</i>
<i>amount of impurities and toxins...</i>

604
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:41,874
<i>at any given time,</i>
<i>and that's your load.</i>

605
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:44,608
<i>It's the maximum amount</i>
<i>of toxins...</i>

606
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,479
<i>your body can tolerate...</i>

607
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:48,815
<i>which, for most people,</i>
<i>is rather large.</i>

608
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:53,152
<i>But a chemically sensitive person</i>
<i>is not able to carry a normal load.</i>

609
01:00:53,224 --> 01:00:56,091
<i>What we have to do is unload.</i>

610
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,355
<i>This means we go back to zero...</i>

611
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:01,796
<i>and starting from scratch,</i>
<i>substance by substance...</i>

612
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,130
<i>we build the load back up.</i>

613
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,898
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>the goal is to get clear.</i>

614
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:09,701
<i>And so the safest</i>
<i>and quickest way to clear...</i>

615
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:11,332
<i>is to fast.</i>

616
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:15,209
<i>Fasting can last up to five days,</i>
<i>depending on the individual...</i>

617
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:18,476
<i>and is usually followed</i>
<i>by the rotation diet...</i>

618
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,312
<i>or the rare foods diet...</i>

619
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:22,511
<i>both of which help protect</i>
<i>the system...</i>

620
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:25,420
<i>while reintroducing foods</i>
<i>back into it.</i>

621
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,423
<i>Whatever diet you choose...</i>

622
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:30,460
<i>be sure to omit mold antigen</i>
<i>containing foods...</i>

623
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:33,190
<i>like bread, cheese, alcohol...</i>

624
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:35,664
<i>ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise...</i>

625
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,667
<i>mustard, coffee or chocolate.</i>

626
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,727
<i>Molds are very hard</i>
<i>on the immune system...</i>

627
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:42,670
<i>whether you're environmentally ill</i>
<i>or not.</i>

628
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,901
<i>Throughout your unloading process...</i>

629
01:01:44,976 --> 01:01:48,571
<i>be sure to have adjusted</i>
<i>your living conditions accordingly.</i>

630
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:53,015
<i>Safe bodies need safe environments</i>
<i>in which to live...</i>

631
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,450
<i>and there are healthy alternatives</i>
<i>that exist...</i>

632
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:57,714
<i>forjust about every toxic product...</i>

633
01:01:57,788 --> 01:02:00,518
<i>gas or ventilation system</i>
<i>out there.</i>

634
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,957
<i>But it's up to you</i>
<i>to find them.</i>

635
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:28,982
I'm sorry.
We're spraying right now.

636
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,113
Oh, my God!

637
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,290
Carol, you're doing fine.
Hang in there.

638
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:44,596
You need to concentrate.

639
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:46,660
Keep your head to the side, Carol.

640
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:52,706
Keep with us, Carol.

641
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:55,678
Keep your head to the side.

642
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,460
No unusual foods, no medication.

643
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:20,527
- Emotional strain?
- No.

644
01:03:20,604 --> 01:03:24,131
Can you think of anything else
that might be causing it?

645
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,604
What you're saying, Carol,
is that this is based...

646
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,513
solely on the pesticide
and nothing else.

647
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:37,949
I have a chemical impairment...

648
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:41,856
I realize that, but it's not
turning up on the tests.

649
01:03:44,128 --> 01:03:46,119
Please don't do that!

650
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,631
Nurse, don't spray that here.

651
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,291
Thanks.

652
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,131
Look, Carol,
from a medical standpoint...

653
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,404
there's no way to prove this thing
is an immune system breakdown...

654
01:03:59,477 --> 01:04:03,106
much less one based
on environmental factors.

655
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,708
Now, if your psychiatrist
can't provide...

656
01:04:07,785 --> 01:04:09,753
Think, honey.

657
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,015
What gave you the bloody lip?

658
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:13,954
What would cause you
to actually bleed?

659
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,492
I don't know.

660
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:21,456
The chemicals.

661
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,912
<i>Well, things just started</i>
<i>tumbling down on top of me.</i>

662
01:04:44,522 --> 01:04:47,787
<i>It is a real problem.</i>
<i>More people are becoming aware.</i>

663
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:50,554
<i>More and more people</i>
<i>are becoming sick from chemicals.</i>

664
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:52,789
<i>Nestled in the foothills</i>
<i>of Albuquerque...</i>

665
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:54,797
<i>the Wrenwood Center</i>
<i>describes itself...</i>

666
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:57,060
<i>as a nonprofit,</i>
<i>communal settlement...</i>

667
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,398
<i>dedicated to the healing individual.</i>

668
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:03,236
<i>Offering the services of a health</i>
<i>retreat and community center...</i>

669
01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:06,071
- <i>Wrenwood consists of 200 residents...</i>
- Greg?

670
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:08,441
- <i>visitors and staff who suffer...</i>
- Greg!

671
01:05:08,512 --> 01:05:10,946
- <i>from chemical sensitivity...</i>
- Listen. This thing's on.

672
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:13,347
<i>Including its founder,</i>
<i>author Peter Dunning.</i>

673
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:17,046
<i>Environmental illness is one of</i>
<i>a cluster of new immune disorders...</i>

674
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:20,249
<i>such as Epstein</i>- <i>Barr syndrome,</i>
<i>chronic fatigue syndrome...</i>

675
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:22,019
<i>and, of course, AIDS...</i>

676
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,458
<i>which continue to elude</i>
<i>conventional medicine.</i>

677
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:28,257
<i>At Wrenwood,</i>
<i>we offer an alternative.</i>

678
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,834
<i>I like to think of us</i>
<i>as a safe haven for troubled times.</i>

679
01:05:32,903 --> 01:05:38,136
<i>We're the most extensive cooperative</i>
<i>treatment residency of our kind.</i>

680
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:41,372
- <i>What makes us really unique...</i>
- I think I...

681
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:43,470
<i>is our emphasis on the individual.</i>

682
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:48,310
I heard about this place
from somewhere.

683
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:51,411
<i>... warning us</i>
<i>of a disease</i>- <i>ridden future?</i>

684
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,822
<i>If so, the Wrenwood Center</i>
<i>is certainly ahead of its time.</i>

685
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:57,326
<i>People come</i>
<i>for all different reasons.</i>

686
01:05:57,394 --> 01:06:00,591
<i>The thing we all have in common</i>
<i>is why.</i>

687
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:04,065
<i>Why did we all get sick</i>
<i>to begin with?</i>

688
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,068
What is it called?

689
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:09,138
Wrenwood.

690
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:24,080
It's right in here.

691
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,803
Stop!

692
01:07:54,878 --> 01:07:56,539
Stop!

693
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:03,177
Not allowed!

694
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:06,812
Go back!

695
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,415
- Not allowed!
- What's she going on about?

696
01:08:09,493 --> 01:08:12,519
Wait. You better stop.

697
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:14,029
Stop!

698
01:08:15,432 --> 01:08:17,332
Go back!

699
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:20,564
You're contaminating
this entire area!

700
01:08:22,206 --> 01:08:23,434
How much do I owe you?

701
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:57,931
I see you.

702
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:34,935
Excuse me!

703
01:09:38,015 --> 01:09:40,347
- Excuse me. Are you Carol?
- Yes.

704
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,885
Hi. I'm Susan.
I work with Claire.

705
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,716
- We've spoken on the phone.
- Hi.

706
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:46,881
We're so glad you made it.

707
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,687
I heard Nell making a ruckus.
I thought it was your car.

708
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,694
- I hope she wasn't too...
- Oh, no.

709
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:55,357
She's been having a rough time.
Her husband's very sick.

710
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:57,923
She's just...

711
01:09:58,001 --> 01:09:59,992
That's okay.

712
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,130
Well, let me help you
with your things.

713
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:05,141
I'll take this one.

714
01:10:05,209 --> 01:10:06,642
Thanks.

715
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,176
This is a chemical-free zone.

716
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,409
We have reading boxes...

717
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:15,179
safe TV...

718
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:19,882
and there's a 911 phone
in case of medical emergency.

719
01:10:19,957 --> 01:10:22,289
Right.

720
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:25,226
We're sorry your husband
wasn't able to join you.

721
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:28,423
I know. He's in the middle
of all this business.

722
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:32,299
They should be here soon, though.
He and our son.

723
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:34,963
- I should call them, actually.
- Sure.

724
01:10:35,038 --> 01:10:38,007
- There's a phone inside the center.
- Great.

725
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,975
We acquired the center in 1978.

726
01:10:44,047 --> 01:10:46,811
We've been battling to keep it
ever since.

727
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:48,749
Basically this...

728
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:51,379
is where all group convening...

729
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,616
takes place.

730
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,658
We have all our workshops...

731
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:58,752
and our evening talks...

732
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:00,558
that sort of thing here.

733
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:04,465
The dining room
is right across the way.

734
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:07,299
- The other side of the street.
- Oh, hi!

735
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:08,963
You must be Carol.

736
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,098
Carol, this is Claire,
our director.

737
01:11:11,175 --> 01:11:14,008
Hi. Welcome to Wrenwood.

738
01:11:14,077 --> 01:11:16,011
How was your trip?

739
01:11:19,116 --> 01:11:21,584
You're just wiped out.

740
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,847
There's nothing more debilitating
than travel.

741
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:26,321
Claire was hypersensitive
when she first came to Wrenwood.

742
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:28,620
Now I'm just semi-hypersensitive
like the rest of the world.

743
01:11:28,692 --> 01:11:31,183
I'm a little... from the flight.

744
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:35,288
I know. We'll get you checked in
and take you to your cabin.

745
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:38,357
Then you can flop or whatever
until dinner.

746
01:11:38,435 --> 01:11:40,926
But I know that there are...

747
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:43,234
quite a few people
anxious to meet you.

748
01:11:43,307 --> 01:11:44,899
Thank you.

749
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:48,035
If you want to leave your bags here
and use the pay phones...

750
01:11:48,111 --> 01:11:50,272
they are just beyond the chapel.

751
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,110
The little auditorium to the right.

752
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,615
Okay.

753
01:11:57,454 --> 01:11:59,046
Thank you.

754
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:12,124
<i>Hello?</i>

755
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:15,171
- Hi. It's me.
- <i>Hi. Are you there?</i>

756
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:17,935
- Yeah, I'm here.
- <i>Great!</i>

757
01:12:19,309 --> 01:12:22,767
- <i>Is it nice?</i>
- Yeah.

758
01:12:22,846 --> 01:12:24,939
- <i>That's great, honey.</i>
- Yeah.

759
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:26,710
You know, we'll see.

760
01:12:26,783 --> 01:12:29,843
Did you forget anything?

761
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,946
<i>No, I just thought I'd call,</i>
<i>tell you I was here.</i>

762
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,621
I'm glad you caught me.
We were about to eat.

763
01:12:37,694 --> 01:12:39,389
<i>Oh, go ahead.</i>

764
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:42,523
- I'm sorry.
- <i>No, I'm glad.</i>

765
01:12:42,599 --> 01:12:45,067
<i>I'm glad it's nice there.</i>
<i>That's great.</i>

766
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:47,695
<i>Look, you just relax...</i>

767
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:50,239
and take care of yourself,
get well quick...

768
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:53,003
and we'll come see you
in a couple of weeks.

769
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:56,477
Soon as I reach deadline on this.
Okay, babe?

770
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:57,979
Okay.

771
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:01,481
- Love you.
- <i>I love you too, honey.</i>

772
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,247
- Say hi to Rory.
- I will.

773
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:07,256
And we'll talk again real soon.

774
01:13:07,324 --> 01:13:09,417
- Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

775
01:13:09,493 --> 01:13:11,484
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- <i>Bye.</i>

776
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:12,994
Night.

777
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,565
<i>I want to welcome all newcomers...</i>

778
01:13:20,637 --> 01:13:20,771
all short- And long-term visitors...

779
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,205
all short- And long-term visitors...

780
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,207
and extend our warmest support...

781
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,836
for the acceleration
of your healing process.

782
01:13:28,912 --> 01:13:32,939
So that you can relax and receive
the full benefit of your stay...

783
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:37,578
we ask that you observe community
wishes in the following ways:

784
01:13:37,654 --> 01:13:40,487
Silent meals are observed
at breakfast and lunch...

785
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:44,186
with a side of the room for men
and a side of the room for women.

786
01:13:44,261 --> 01:13:48,197
We ask you to refrain from smoking,
drinking and use of drugs...

787
01:13:48,265 --> 01:13:50,165
while on the premises.

788
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:54,067
We ask that you respect our practice
of moderation in dress...

789
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:57,072
and restraint in sexual interaction.

790
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,200
Instead, we ask that you try...

791
01:14:00,277 --> 01:14:03,246
to focus these feelings inward...

792
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,907
toward your personal growth
and self-realization.

793
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,714
End of speech.
Welcome, everybody.

794
01:14:09,786 --> 01:14:12,584
Especially our long-termers,
Carol and Ward.

795
01:14:17,094 --> 01:14:19,085
Now, with no further ado...

796
01:14:19,162 --> 01:14:21,653
I give you our own Peter Dunning.

797
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:27,836
- You like this shirt?
- Are you familiar with his books?

798
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:30,065
- I don't think so.
- They're <i>so</i> wonderful.

799
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,074
I'll lend you some.

800
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:35,771
Peter is a chemically sensitive
person with Al DS.

801
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:38,212
His perspective is incredibly vast.

802
01:14:38,281 --> 01:14:41,546
- My deepest welcome to Carol and Wade.
- Ward!

803
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:44,416
Ward.
Welcome to Wrenwood.

804
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,683
If you'd all close your eyes...

805
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:56,027
and pass your valuables
to the front.

806
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:58,226
No, no. Come on!

807
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,597
Not really. Okay.

808
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:05,698
We're feeling good, huh?
We're feeling warmth.

809
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:09,109
We can look
into each other's eyes...

810
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:11,306
and actually see rejuvenation...

811
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,872
and personal transformation
happening.

812
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:16,843
Why?

813
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,718
Because we've left
the judgmental behind.

814
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:25,060
And with it...

815
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:28,393
the shaming condition that kept us
locked up in all the pain.

816
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:33,401
But what I want to share
with you tonight...

817
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:36,064
what I want to give you tonight...

818
01:15:37,641 --> 01:15:39,734
is an image to reflect on.

819
01:15:41,778 --> 01:15:44,076
An image of a world outside...

820
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:47,541
as positive...

821
01:15:49,519 --> 01:15:51,453
and as free...

822
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:56,082
as the world we've created here.

823
01:15:57,627 --> 01:15:59,925
Because when you look out
on the world...

824
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:01,930
from a place of love...

825
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:05,967
and a place of forgiveness...

826
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:09,938
what you are seeing outside...

827
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:16,039
is a reflection
of what you feel within.

828
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,781
Does that make sense?

829
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,623
What do I see outside me?

830
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,985
I see the growth
of environmentalism.

831
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:33,654
Right?

832
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:35,891
And holistic study.

833
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:40,460
I see a decline
in drugs and promiscuity.

834
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:50,238
I see sensitivity training
in the work place!

835
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:54,715
And the men's movement.
And multiculturalism.

836
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:59,986
I see all these positive things
outside in the world...

837
01:17:00,056 --> 01:17:03,082
because what I'm seeing
is a global transformation...

838
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,355
identical to the transformation...

839
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:10,530
I revel at within.

840
01:17:16,406 --> 01:17:18,271
And with that...

841
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:22,378
we are one with the power
that created us.

842
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:26,207
We are safe...

843
01:17:26,283 --> 01:17:28,547
and all is well in our world.

844
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:40,988
<i>Kind friends, all gathered 'round</i>

845
01:17:41,064 --> 01:17:44,056
<i>There's something I would say</i>

846
01:17:44,134 --> 01:17:47,797
<i>That what brings us together here</i>

847
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:52,774
<i>Has blessed us all today</i>

848
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:56,539
<i>Love has made a circle</i>

849
01:17:56,613 --> 01:18:00,344
<i>That holds us all inside</i>

850
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:04,751
<i>Where strangers are as family</i>

851
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:09,758
<i>And loneliness can't hide</i>

852
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:14,263
<i>So give yourself to love</i>

853
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:18,461
<i>If love is what you're after</i>

854
01:18:18,535 --> 01:18:22,471
<i>Open up your hearts to</i>

855
01:18:22,539 --> 01:18:25,667
<i>The tears and laughter and</i>

856
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,371
<i>Give yourself to love</i>

857
01:18:29,446 --> 01:18:34,679
<i>Give yourself to love</i>

858
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:26,394
Carol?

859
01:20:26,463 --> 01:20:28,158
I'm sorry.

860
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:30,165
Are you having a reaction?

861
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:32,394
No, I'm fine.

862
01:20:58,428 --> 01:21:00,020
It's okay.

863
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:02,930
Just breathe.

864
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:07,232
That's right.

865
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:08,736
Good.

866
01:21:12,175 --> 01:21:14,973
That's good. You're okay.

867
01:21:19,716 --> 01:21:21,445
Oh, Carol.

868
01:21:21,518 --> 01:21:23,452
You know something?

869
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:27,251
All these feelings you're having...

870
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:30,121
are just fine.

871
01:21:30,193 --> 01:21:32,127
They're so natural.

872
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:37,290
I mean, you've just done
something so big.

873
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:40,063
You know, something...

874
01:21:40,136 --> 01:21:42,730
many people never do
in their lifetime.

875
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:45,570
You've taken this big step...

876
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:47,542
on your own behalf.

877
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,738
You've left behind...

878
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:52,839
everything that's known and secure...

879
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:55,248
and all the people
you love and trust.

880
01:21:55,318 --> 01:21:58,412
And you've come
to this strange new place...

881
01:21:58,488 --> 01:22:00,422
with strange new people.

882
01:22:03,226 --> 01:22:06,093
It's completely understandable...

883
01:22:06,162 --> 01:22:08,596
that you might feel lonely...

884
01:22:08,665 --> 01:22:11,634
or fearful or even angry.

885
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,600
You know...

886
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:21,610
when I first came here,
I couldn't even walk.

887
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:26,906
I'd been living six miles
from this chemical factory...

888
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:28,917
this was in Michigan...

889
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,644
that was leaking...

890
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:36,214
15 gallons of chemical by-products
every day.

891
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:42,097
When I got here, all I could do
was sit in my safe room...

892
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:44,633
and every day...

893
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:47,135
every hour of every day...

894
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:50,331
I would look at myself
in the mirror...

895
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:52,704
and I would say to myself...

896
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:56,377
"Claire...

897
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:58,380
I love you.

898
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:02,317
I really love you."

899
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:09,450
At the end of the month,
I could leave my room...

900
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,460
and shortly thereafter...

901
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,462
I was walking.

902
01:23:16,432 --> 01:23:18,866
For me...

903
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:21,597
this whole thing was a gift...

904
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:26,369
because everything
got taken away from me.

905
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:28,467
I mean...

906
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,480
everything in the material world.

907
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:35,950
And what was left...

908
01:23:37,787 --> 01:23:39,379
was me.

909
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:50,198
Thank you, Claire.

910
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:54,336
Are you better?

911
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:57,739
You'll do fine.

912
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:04,143
Sweet dreams.

913
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:06,272
- Good night.
- Good night.

914
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,948
<i>Forever and ever</i>

915
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:42,951
<i>You're right where I found</i>...

916
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,124
<i>Sweet love showing us</i>...

917
01:24:52,095 --> 01:24:55,326
<i>Never seen such a beautiful</i>...

918
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:19,955
<i>"Dear Greg and Rory...</i>

919
01:25:21,391 --> 01:25:23,256
<i>How are you guys?</i>

920
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,556
<i>I hope everything is going good.</i>

921
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,459
<i>I really miss you.</i>

922
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:31,523
<i>I'm feeling better so I decided</i>
<i>to stay the full amount.</i>

923
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:33,569
<i>At first</i>
<i>it was hard to get used to.</i>

924
01:25:33,636 --> 01:25:36,730
<i>But now I really think</i>
<i>it's starting to help.</i>

925
01:25:36,806 --> 01:25:40,037
<i>I've been so much more relaxed</i>
<i>and eating healthfully.</i>

926
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:43,044
<i>And the desert landscape</i>
<i>is really beautiful here.</i>

927
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:06,661
<i>I can't wait until the 25th</i>
<i>to show you around...</i>

928
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:09,227
<i>and introduce you to everyone.</i>

929
01:26:09,305 --> 01:26:12,832
<i>Give my love to Sally</i>
<i>and your mother and Linda.</i>

930
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:15,742
<i>Be sure and help your dad, Rory.</i>

931
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:18,007
<i>Love and kisses, Carol. "</i>

932
01:26:34,163 --> 01:26:36,028
Is that Lester you're watching?

933
01:26:36,099 --> 01:26:38,863
Sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

934
01:26:38,935 --> 01:26:42,701
It's fine.
I was just watching him go by.

935
01:26:44,307 --> 01:26:46,138
Why does he...

936
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,144
Lester is just...

937
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:52,078
very, very afraid.

938
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:54,548
Afraid to eat,
afraid to breathe.

939
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:01,454
Let's talk about you.

940
01:27:01,524 --> 01:27:04,288
I heard you weren't feeling well.

941
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,726
It was just a little...

942
01:27:06,796 --> 01:27:10,459
shortness of breath
and some dizziness.

943
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:12,524
I noticed the highway near here.

944
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,934
I wondered if my cabin room...

945
01:27:15,004 --> 01:27:17,131
was a little downwind
or something.

946
01:27:17,206 --> 01:27:19,800
I thought that
if I tried another cabin...

947
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:22,811
Claire is the best person
to speak to about that.

948
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:25,006
- Claire is?
- She's really the one.

949
01:27:26,816 --> 01:27:29,080
I remember Claire sharing with me...

950
01:27:29,152 --> 01:27:31,814
some concern over you.

951
01:27:31,888 --> 01:27:34,288
That you'd been feeling
some remorse.

952
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:38,660
Maybe some apprehension.

953
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,863
- I was just...
- All I'm saying...

954
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:47,392
is that these feelings you're having
are extremely common.

955
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,439
Especially in relation
to new environments.

956
01:27:50,506 --> 01:27:54,272
Especially for someone
who is environmentally ill, okay?

957
01:27:54,343 --> 01:27:57,210
What we're about
is trying to help absorb...

958
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,544
as many of these tensions
as we can...

959
01:27:59,615 --> 01:28:02,379
so you're free to do
the kind of healing...

960
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:04,749
that you need to be doing.

961
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,448
Does that make any sense?

962
01:28:06,522 --> 01:28:08,717
Because when that's accomplished,
I'm doing my job.

963
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:11,555
No, I know.
I'm just still learning...

964
01:28:11,627 --> 01:28:15,654
you know, the words.

965
01:28:18,401 --> 01:28:20,335
The words are...

966
01:28:20,403 --> 01:28:22,667
just a way
to get to what's true.

967
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,536
- Right? See the coyote?
- Where?

968
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,495
" Duty Sign-Up
Sundays Sharing Meal"

969
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,234
- Is that all right?
- Sure.

970
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,763
I need a partner.

971
01:29:31,841 --> 01:29:33,274
Great.

972
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:38,207
- We have to decide what to cook.
- Right.

973
01:29:40,016 --> 01:29:42,814
All right, well...

974
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:46,343
I'll think about what to cook.

975
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:48,117
Me too.

976
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:50,858
Bye.

977
01:29:56,165 --> 01:29:58,929
She had all these different...

978
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,026
candies and stuff...

979
01:30:01,103 --> 01:30:03,697
she'd keep in there.

980
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:10,639
She used to let me open the clasp
and look inside the purse...

981
01:30:10,713 --> 01:30:12,647
and close the clasp.

982
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:16,951
I'll never forget that purse.

983
01:30:20,756 --> 01:30:22,587
Okay.

984
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:25,024
Now speaker number two...

985
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:27,562
describe to your friend...

986
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,565
a room you remember having
as a child.

987
01:30:44,547 --> 01:30:46,481
God, this is...

988
01:30:51,687 --> 01:30:54,747
I guess this one I had was...

989
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:58,759
had...

990
01:31:00,396 --> 01:31:01,988
yellow wallpaper.

991
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:04,765
And...

992
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:18,344
- Oh, my God.
- Who's that?

993
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:24,542
- I think it's Nell's husband.
- That looks like Nell's husband.

994
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:38,799
Today...

995
01:31:42,071 --> 01:31:46,064
is another precious day on earth.

996
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:51,338
So let's throw away...

997
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:53,348
every negative...

998
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:58,084
destructive thought
we might have...

999
01:32:00,456 --> 01:32:02,856
and look around ourselves
with love.

1000
01:32:09,932 --> 01:32:12,025
I tried to teach him this.

1001
01:32:17,006 --> 01:32:18,940
To give up the rage.

1002
01:32:24,547 --> 01:32:26,879
To strive for a quiet mind.

1003
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:38,392
My concern is it sounds
like a spiraling down.

1004
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:41,453
If you're feeling more sensitive
to the fumes that way...

1005
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:43,725
you shouldn't really be outside.

1006
01:32:45,367 --> 01:32:48,234
The problem is there aren't
any center accommodations...

1007
01:32:48,304 --> 01:32:51,705
available right now
except for cabins and dormitories.

1008
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:54,299
Oh, I'm fine, really.

1009
01:32:54,376 --> 01:32:57,903
Oh, except for Harry's.

1010
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,346
Harry's?

1011
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:03,544
Mr. Keene... Nell's husband...
built a safe house.

1012
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,553
It's right next to recycling.

1013
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:08,021
That little white igloo.

1014
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,421
He lived in that?

1015
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:10,925
Oh, yeah.

1016
01:33:10,993 --> 01:33:14,019
After his stroke, he needed
a more controllable space.

1017
01:33:14,096 --> 01:33:17,725
So she stayed in the cabin
and he lived in the safe house.

1018
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,360
He actually improved.

1019
01:33:20,436 --> 01:33:22,802
It's ventilated
and porcelain-lined...

1020
01:33:22,872 --> 01:33:24,840
and he was perfectly safe...

1021
01:33:24,907 --> 01:33:27,341
as long as no one
set foot inside.

1022
01:33:28,577 --> 01:33:31,512
I don't know what
she's planning to do with it.

1023
01:33:41,123 --> 01:33:44,524
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
a confession I'd like to make.

1024
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:49,730
I've stopped reading the papers.

1025
01:33:53,736 --> 01:33:56,227
I've stopped watching
the news on TV.

1026
01:33:59,108 --> 01:34:01,508
I've heard
the media gloom and doom...

1027
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:04,774
and I've seen their fatalistic,
negative attitude...

1028
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:08,010
and I finally realized,
I don't need it.

1029
01:34:10,586 --> 01:34:14,181
And so I transform
that negative stimulus...

1030
01:34:14,256 --> 01:34:16,781
into something
that will not do harm to me.

1031
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:23,157
Because if I really believe
that life is...

1032
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:28,868
that devastating,
that destructive...

1033
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:36,377
I'm afraid that my immune system
will believe it too.

1034
01:34:39,748 --> 01:34:42,376
And I can't afford
to take that risk.

1035
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,215
Neither can you.

1036
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:03,394
We are one...

1037
01:35:03,472 --> 01:35:06,339
with the power that created us.

1038
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:08,433
We are safe...

1039
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:12,005
and all is well in our world.

1040
01:35:20,122 --> 01:35:22,920
My brother called
and Darlene had another girl.

1041
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:25,825
Ohh. I'll call them tonight.

1042
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,428
And Linda called...

1043
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:32,467
and said to hurry up and clear
or clean or whatever it is...

1044
01:35:32,534 --> 01:35:34,024
Clear.

1045
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,798
And come on home.

1046
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:37,463
That's sweet.

1047
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,481
So you really feel like it's...

1048
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,711
still the right choice?

1049
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:52,378
Yeah, I...

1050
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:56,584
I do. I mean...

1051
01:35:56,659 --> 01:35:59,127
right before the fumes,
I was good.

1052
01:35:59,194 --> 01:36:01,287
My load was up.

1053
01:36:01,363 --> 01:36:04,059
I was eating well. So...

1054
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,465
What did they say about the fumes?

1055
01:36:06,535 --> 01:36:11,336
Just that I'd probably move
to a different cabin somewhere.

1056
01:36:11,407 --> 01:36:14,740
- Uh-huh.
- Where I won't feel them.

1057
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,505
Right.

1058
01:36:19,348 --> 01:36:21,509
Okay.

1059
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:25,041
I just think it's true
what they say.

1060
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,145
That it's up to the individual...

1061
01:36:27,222 --> 01:36:29,156
and that it takes time.

1062
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,693
Right.

1063
01:36:38,067 --> 01:36:40,592
- Whose house is that?
- That's Peter's.

1064
01:36:41,437 --> 01:36:44,201
- It's gorgeous, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1065
01:36:44,273 --> 01:36:46,673
- Feel like moving?
- No.

1066
01:37:16,105 --> 01:37:18,539
Her husband just passed away.

1067
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,148
Come on, Rory.

1068
01:37:30,953 --> 01:37:32,386
Now!

1069
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,961
Steve...

1070
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:45,261
why did you become sick?

1071
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:48,701
Well, I became sick...

1072
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:52,172
because I just O.D.'d
on all the drugs I was doing.

1073
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:55,608
Uh-huh.
Why did you become addicted?

1074
01:37:56,678 --> 01:37:58,942
Well, I guess I became addicted...

1075
01:37:59,014 --> 01:38:01,380
to, like, blot out the pain...

1076
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:06,054
of not liking myself.

1077
01:38:07,222 --> 01:38:09,156
Of hating myself, really.

1078
01:38:11,994 --> 01:38:13,586
Self-hatred.

1079
01:38:17,533 --> 01:38:19,467
Okay. Thanks, Steve.

1080
01:38:23,405 --> 01:38:25,032
- Hello, Joyce.
- Hi.

1081
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:27,507
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

1082
01:38:29,044 --> 01:38:32,013
Joyce, what do you think
was behind your illness?

1083
01:38:32,915 --> 01:38:34,849
Why did you become sick?

1084
01:38:36,752 --> 01:38:40,688
I believe that I made myself sick...

1085
01:38:40,756 --> 01:38:42,747
after my son got sick...

1086
01:38:42,825 --> 01:38:46,317
because I was just...

1087
01:38:46,395 --> 01:38:50,263
You get so eaten up with guilt,
really.

1088
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,930
Because I felt
that I had done it to him.

1089
01:38:54,002 --> 01:38:56,835
I was the one who put him
in that school.

1090
01:38:56,905 --> 01:38:59,203
I put him in that environment.

1091
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:01,401
You were punishing yourself.

1092
01:39:07,649 --> 01:39:09,082
Yeah.

1093
01:39:30,772 --> 01:39:32,205
Thanks.

1094
01:39:35,244 --> 01:39:36,472
Marilyn?

1095
01:39:40,048 --> 01:39:41,982
I was...

1096
01:39:43,952 --> 01:39:45,943
deeply wounded...

1097
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:48,512
as a child...

1098
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:51,286
and had completely blocked it out...

1099
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,294
for years.

1100
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:56,695
And then suddenly became very ill.

1101
01:39:57,799 --> 01:39:59,733
Why, do you think?

1102
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,571
Maybe to let myself know
something was wrong.

1103
01:40:05,641 --> 01:40:07,074
Okay.

1104
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:09,643
And...

1105
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:13,609
the person who hurt you the most...

1106
01:40:16,485 --> 01:40:18,077
Was me.

1107
01:40:20,255 --> 01:40:22,621
For...

1108
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:27,328
Not forgiving him.

1109
01:40:29,965 --> 01:40:31,398
Okay.

1110
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:35,603
Thank you, Marilyn.

1111
01:40:38,307 --> 01:40:39,399
Carol.

1112
01:40:40,976 --> 01:40:42,910
Would you like to respond?

1113
01:40:44,346 --> 01:40:46,280
Okay, okay.

1114
01:40:46,348 --> 01:40:50,216
We don't want to force anyone.
Nell?

1115
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:54,354
What?

1116
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:56,516
Would you like to take part?

1117
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:59,284
What is the question?

1118
01:41:00,362 --> 01:41:02,557
The question is...

1119
01:41:02,631 --> 01:41:05,122
why did you become sick?

1120
01:41:13,508 --> 01:41:17,239
First, I got sick,
and my husband thought I was crazy.

1121
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:21,147
And then he got sick
the same way.

1122
01:41:23,085 --> 01:41:26,077
What was happening in your life
around the time you first...

1123
01:41:26,154 --> 01:41:29,681
How were you feeling
when you first got sick?

1124
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:38,224
I just wanted to get a gun...

1125
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:42,430
and blow off the heads
of everyone who got me like this.

1126
01:41:44,172 --> 01:41:46,538
Nobody out there made you sick.
You know that.

1127
01:41:46,608 --> 01:41:49,509
The only person who can make you
get sick is you, right?

1128
01:41:49,578 --> 01:41:53,605
Whatever the sickness,
if our immune system is damaged...

1129
01:41:53,682 --> 01:41:55,616
it's because
we have allowed it to be...

1130
01:41:55,684 --> 01:41:58,710
through exactly the kind of anger
you're showing us now.

1131
01:41:58,787 --> 01:42:00,948
Does that make sense?

1132
01:42:01,023 --> 01:42:03,719
Does anybody have a problem
with that?

1133
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:07,919
Which is why you need to remember
your affirmations...

1134
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:11,056
and figure out how to love Nell
a lot more.

1135
01:42:13,135 --> 01:42:15,069
And even Nell's disease.

1136
01:42:17,472 --> 01:42:19,906
And put that gun of yours away.

1137
01:42:26,782 --> 01:42:28,215
Sometimes...

1138
01:42:31,253 --> 01:42:34,916
Sometimes all I see
is the hatred and frailty...

1139
01:42:38,293 --> 01:42:40,420
people's cruelty to one another...

1140
01:42:41,496 --> 01:42:43,327
cruelty to themselves.

1141
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,334
And I realize...

1142
01:42:49,738 --> 01:42:51,672
how lucky I am.

1143
01:42:59,981 --> 01:43:01,573
How blessed.

1144
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,206
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

1145
01:44:01,309 --> 01:44:04,642
- Rory, be careful. It's real heavy.
- I have it.

1146
01:44:05,747 --> 01:44:08,045
Don't talk to your mother
in that tone.

1147
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:09,549
Fine.

1148
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:14,044
- What time's your flight?
- 7:20.

1149
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:20,220
Rory, make sure all our stuff s
in the car and we're ready to go.

1150
01:44:22,531 --> 01:44:24,965
- Want me to get that?
- I got it.

1151
01:44:34,509 --> 01:44:36,739
Whoa. Watch it.

1152
01:44:47,088 --> 01:44:48,680
All right?

1153
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:52,885
I think it might be your cologne.

1154
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:55,759
Honey, I'm not wearing any cologne.

1155
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,561
Maybe in the shirt.

1156
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:00,567
I don't know.

1157
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:12,041
We better get moving
if we're gonna catch the plane.

1158
01:45:13,181 --> 01:45:15,843
You're going to be okay?

1159
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:18,852
I'm fine.
It's just for a short time.

1160
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:21,388
- I know.
- I'll be fine.

1161
01:45:25,927 --> 01:45:28,225
- Can I hug you?
- Of course.

1162
01:46:02,597 --> 01:46:05,225
This other guy didn't know anything
was wrong with him either...

1163
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:09,259
except that whenever
he would go into a mall...

1164
01:46:09,337 --> 01:46:11,498
he would get totally depressed...

1165
01:46:11,573 --> 01:46:13,871
start crying really hard...

1166
01:46:13,942 --> 01:46:16,536
and contemplating suicide.

1167
01:46:16,611 --> 01:46:20,047
Then he would step outside
and he would be fine...

1168
01:46:20,115 --> 01:46:21,707
totally normal.

1169
01:46:21,783 --> 01:46:24,251
This would happen to him
every single time.

1170
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:26,913
- God.
- Yeah.

1171
01:46:26,988 --> 01:46:29,456
- You know what they called him?
- What?

1172
01:46:29,524 --> 01:46:34,223
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Formaldehyde.

1173
01:46:34,296 --> 01:46:36,560
God.

1174
01:46:36,631 --> 01:46:39,122
- I'm so gullible.
- No, I'm serious.

1175
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,134
This really happened.

1176
01:46:42,671 --> 01:46:46,334
I always forget
if it's pasta, cheese, sauce...

1177
01:46:46,408 --> 01:46:49,104
cheese, pasta...

1178
01:46:49,177 --> 01:46:52,510
or pasta, sauce, cheese...

1179
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:55,947
pasta, cheese, sauce.

1180
01:46:56,017 --> 01:46:59,180
I think it's pasta...

1181
01:46:59,254 --> 01:47:01,518
pasta, pasta, pasta, cheese...

1182
01:47:01,589 --> 01:47:04,319
- Stop it!
- Pasta, sauce.

1183
01:47:04,392 --> 01:47:06,792
Suddenly, all I see...

1184
01:47:06,861 --> 01:47:10,024
all over my hands and legs are...

1185
01:47:10,098 --> 01:47:12,589
black, horrible sores,
all over me.

1186
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:14,100
Oozing.

1187
01:47:14,169 --> 01:47:16,296
At first I'm horrified...

1188
01:47:16,371 --> 01:47:19,169
and I'm full of self-pity and anger.

1189
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,936
I'm enraged until I realize...

1190
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,478
Suddenly I look down again
and realize...

1191
01:47:24,546 --> 01:47:26,673
that they aren't sores at all...

1192
01:47:26,748 --> 01:47:28,181
but these...

1193
01:47:30,018 --> 01:47:35,149
wilted black pansies that
I used to pick when I was a child.

1194
01:47:35,223 --> 01:47:37,157
So in my dream, I remember that.

1195
01:47:37,225 --> 01:47:40,888
As I pick up each wilted flower...

1196
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:44,655
they just instantly bloom...

1197
01:47:44,733 --> 01:47:46,667
into beautiful bouquets.

1198
01:47:48,036 --> 01:47:50,527
- Every single one.
- Ending in rejoice.

1199
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:53,768
- That's remarkable.
- Extraordinary.

1200
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:55,969
Incredible lasagna, guys.

1201
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:59,377
- Yeah.
- Great dinner, both of you.

1202
01:47:59,447 --> 01:48:02,211
And, you know, it almost tasted
like the real thing.

1203
01:48:02,283 --> 01:48:04,148
To Carol and Chris.

1204
01:48:10,492 --> 01:48:14,428
<i>Sweet love showing us</i>
<i>a heavenly light</i>

1205
01:48:14,496 --> 01:48:17,897
<i>I never seen</i>
<i>such a beautiful sight</i>

1206
01:48:17,966 --> 01:48:21,868
<i>Sweet love flowing on us</i>
<i>every night</i>

1207
01:48:21,936 --> 01:48:25,201
<i>I know forever</i>
<i>we'll be doing it</i>

1208
01:49:20,662 --> 01:49:23,096
Sorry, sorry.

1209
01:49:23,164 --> 01:49:26,133
Um, I've got a little announcement
to make.

1210
01:49:27,202 --> 01:49:29,762
Since it's almost tomorrow...

1211
01:49:29,838 --> 01:49:32,033
and tomorrow happens to be...

1212
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:34,041
Carol's birthday...

1213
01:49:36,144 --> 01:49:39,443
we have a little surprise
for her.

1214
01:49:39,514 --> 01:49:42,847
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow</i>

1215
01:49:42,917 --> 01:49:44,680
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow</i>

1216
01:49:48,423 --> 01:49:51,790
<i>And so say all of us</i>

1217
01:49:57,699 --> 01:49:59,633
Speech!

1218
01:49:59,701 --> 01:50:02,261
- Speech!
- Happy birthday, Carol.

1219
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:06,630
- No!
- Happy birthday, sweetie.

1220
01:50:08,009 --> 01:50:11,376
- Say something.
- I've never made a speech.

1221
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:18,282
I want to thank Chris
for doing this...

1222
01:50:19,487 --> 01:50:22,945
and everybody here so much.

1223
01:50:23,024 --> 01:50:25,993
It just pulled me through
a really hard period.

1224
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,585
Anyway, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1225
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:36,596
I don't know what I'm saying.

1226
01:50:38,106 --> 01:50:42,372
I really hated myself
before I came here...

1227
01:50:42,443 --> 01:50:44,968
so I'm trying to see myself...

1228
01:50:45,046 --> 01:50:48,447
hopefully, more as I am.

1229
01:50:48,516 --> 01:50:49,676
More...

1230
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:55,155
More positive,
like seeing the pluses.

1231
01:50:55,223 --> 01:50:57,919
I think it's slowly opening up now.

1232
01:50:57,992 --> 01:50:59,550
People's minds, like...

1233
01:51:00,695 --> 01:51:02,595
educating and, and...

1234
01:51:02,664 --> 01:51:03,858
Al DS and...

1235
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,564
and other types of diseases...

1236
01:51:08,636 --> 01:51:10,866
because, because...

1237
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:13,635
It is a disease
because it's out there...

1238
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:17,337
and we just have to be
more aware of it.

1239
01:51:17,412 --> 01:51:19,607
We have to make people aware of it...

1240
01:51:19,681 --> 01:51:21,478
and, um, even ourselves...

1241
01:51:21,549 --> 01:51:24,245
like, uh, going...

1242
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:28,085
reading labels
and going into buildings.

1243
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:39,732
To Carol.

1244
01:52:26,547 --> 01:52:28,481
Thank you, Chris.

1245
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:31,142
For everything.

1246
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:34,154
Are you sure you're all right?

1247
01:52:34,222 --> 01:52:36,213
I'm fine, really.

1248
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:42,486
<i>Happy birthday</i>

1249
01:52:44,732 --> 01:52:46,165
Thanks.

1250
01:52:50,038 --> 01:52:52,836
- See you tomorrow.
- For sure.

1251
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:55,942
- Good night.
- Night.

1252
01:54:54,896 --> 01:54:56,830
I love you.

1253
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:03,002
I really love you.

1254
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:11,211
I love you.
