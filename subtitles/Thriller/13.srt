1
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:18,686
- Mom?
- I`m here.

2
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,561
Ma.

3
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,813
You've forgotten.
- How could I forget this.

4
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:46,082
Are you sure this is the right thing?
It feels its a bit better if we thought talk about it..

5
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,171
- Yeah I do.
- We don't have any other option, Clara.

6
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,024
We'll gonna be fine.

7
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,455
If I get off earlier I can pick you up.
- I take the bus.

8
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,506
If I get off earlier I've a couple of
things to do for Jenny's party.

9
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:20,022
Don't worry.

10
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,660
Have a good day.
- You too, Mom.

11
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:45,602
How you doing?
- I don't know.

12
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:51,400
How are we paying for all this?

13
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,928
We put up the house.
- I knew it.

14
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:01,776
Because of you I'm still alive.

15
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:08,164
We decided together.
- What did you all decided together?

16
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:14,271
To live on the street?
For 18 years.

17
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:20,240
Your mother and I have been paying off the house.

18
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,499
Just to fuck it all.

19
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,222
Next year I'll  be a licensed electrician.

20
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:28,873
So theres no more illegal odd jobs.

21
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,275
It'll gonna be fine.

22
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,257
I never wanted to be a burden.

23
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:40,116
Don't say that, Dad.

24
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,335
I`m leaving but.
- So you got what you've been waiting for.

25
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:44,440
Yeah, I got it.
- What it write?

26
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,959
That's not your concern.
- Then go to hell.

27
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,384
That's exactly where I m going.

28
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:56,500
And if I make it back, I'm going to make
so much money, you`re gonna love me again.

29
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:15,910
Your brother would fare better if
the family members visited more often.

30
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:18,819
A year is long time for someone in his condition.

31
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:25,346
I am the only family Ronald has.
I try to get down here as often as I can.

32
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:29,080
Overall his condition is still borderline.
Mr. Valdez.

33
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:33,032
If he skip his medications even for a day
it could be serious.

34
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,675
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,216
Sign here and here
and I'll have him release.

36
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,122
Your brother is here to get you.
You have to go.

37
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:12,010
They take care of you over there?
- Yeah.

38
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,073
Look. Its a new car?

39
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,568
Yeah. You like it?

40
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,537
- Yeah.
- Lets go.

41
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,430
When I turned five years old,
I got a little kitten.

42
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,506
And he was so cute that I
took him to bed with me every night.

43
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,214
I want a little lamb.
and I'll take him to bed every night too.

44
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:53,393
People don't keep sheep inside, Silly.
- I know.

45
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:55,695
Didnt you hear we dont keep sheep inside ...

46
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,483
and we dont take them to bed with us.

47
00:07:57,484 --> 00:08:01,047
My little lamb has to be all white
with black ears.

48
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:05,300
Why black ears?
- That way,Then he wont get mixed up with the other sheep.

49
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,696
- I'll be able to recognize him.
- Very clever.

50
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,789
Thanks, Mom.

51
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:57,273
What's going on man?

52
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:46,356
Hey wait a minute. What the hell you doing, goddamn it?
What the fuck you doing?

53
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,004
Let me the fuck outta here.

54
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:03,059
Let me out of here.

55
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,563
- A lot of people would want money.
- Thank you.

56
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:13,689
That was his job, theres nothing I can do for him.
Maybe a few days.

57
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,006
Can I get you anything? Coffee maybe?
- I`m good no.

58
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:24,894
No, babe.

59
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,367
So whats this job about, man? Dope?

60
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:35,357
No, nothing like that.

61
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:38,862
You need somebody take care off?
- No.

62
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,793
Just asking for a good word.

63
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:45,782
Where do you want to go, my place?
- Listen, I m broke.

64
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,953
I`m on the street.

65
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:50,857
Hey, I havent forgotten what you
did for me when I was away.

66
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,010
If this thing works out
I set you up for good.

67
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,209
How long exactly will it take?
- One day.

68
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:03,326
Jesus, you make all that cash in one day?
- If I make it

69
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:08,511
You made it last time, right?
- That was last time.

70
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:13,747
If my luck always doesn't run out,
you can count on me.

71
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:42,158
- Vincent, you still live at 135 Kissam Avenue. Talbot, Ohio?
- Yeah

72
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:46,813
You have a phone number I can reach you at
if I have any further questions?

73
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:53,112
Sure. 2165550145.

74
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:57,350
Okay Vincent I think thats about it. Thank you.

75
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,546
Do you recall anything else he could have told you
about this affair?

76
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:02,400
No. I already told you he never
spoke about it.

77
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:06,061
Even when he was high?
- No.

78
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,059
Did anyone else come into the house
besides the paramedics and the police?

79
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,675
There was an electrician.
He was the one that called 911.

80
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,741
Thank you, Mrs. Harrison.

81
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:09,415
Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah I feel much better now.

82
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,107
Did you tried that medication?
- No.

83
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:19,097
The doctor says you're not suppose to skip a dose.

84
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:22,505
Fuck her. Feel much better without it anyway.

85
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,193
Town full of fucking towels you know.
All that fuck.

86
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:37,691
I know we're going to make it.
You better Ignore that shit.

87
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,895
Have you going for a job and nothing else.

88
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,580
- What do you think?
- Youre very handsome.

89
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:58,244
They`re gonna love you.

90
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,799
Unshackle his legs.

91
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,131
Hey mister, You in charge here?
You going to tell me what's going on?

92
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:24,420
How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

93
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:31,771
I've been in those goddamm box for two and half days man.
Tell me whats going. What do you want from me?

94
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:34,989
Give him a shower change his
clothes, something fresh.

95
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,587
Where are you all taking me man?
Fuck you.

96
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,412
What about his stuff?
- What are you talking about?

97
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,585
Give it to him.

98
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,240
Fuck you guys

99
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,860
Mr. Harrison?
- Yeah.

100
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:12,780
Tomorrow at noon,  go the PostNet store
at Grand Central.

101
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:16,424
Wait.
- 200 West 39 Street.

102
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,973
With the key that you found with the
cellphone you'll open box 253.

103
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:27,586
Inside you'll find another train ticket
with more instructions.

104
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:33,473
The ticket will be to Macomb.
But you get off one stop before Macomb.

105
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:37,991
One stop before. Is that clear?
- Yeah.

106
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,031
Ticket, please.

107
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:07,813
He's getting off at Macomb.
- What time do we arrive?

108
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,213
The train gets at 3:10.

109
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:15,016
Can I help you guys with anything else?
- No, thank you.

110
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:30,069
Can I have a bottle of water and
a ham sandwich?

111
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:40,916
Are you guys Flinck?
- Yeah, get in.

112
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:56,056
I want to go here.

113
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,127
Do you know it?
- Yeah.

114
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,641
Is it far?
- No, its around the corner.

115
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:17,144
That is 17.70.

116
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,967
Keep the change.
- Thank you.

117
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,528
Give me your phone.

118
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,500
Get in the car.

119
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,059
Which number is it?
- 13.

120
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,620
Come on.

121
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,411
Stand in the middle of the carpet.

122
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,589
Take your clothes off

123
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,533
Faster.

124
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,541
Take off the rest.

125
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,586
Get dressed.

126
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,628
You did'nt find it strange to up and load
somebody in the middle of nowhere?

127
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,889
The guy who is paying me is a customer.
So he knows everyone.

128
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,464
- You havent seen anything else unusual?
- No.

129
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,167
I just left him here
and I left.

130
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,617
Follow me.

131
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,628
Have a sit.

132
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,591
What's that?

133
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:48,220
I can explain, I know ...
- Shut up.

134
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,600
Go get Jack.

135
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,544
You're probably wondering what I'm doing here.
- Quiet.

136
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,425
Mr. Goma.

137
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,629
Is this the young man who is playing tonight?

138
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,467
Yes, that's him.

139
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,133
Very courageous.

140
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,203
Two million.

141
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,772
700,000 at number six.

142
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,021
What's going on?

143
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,145
Who is he?

144
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,114
what do you mean he's the guy I picked up at the train station?

145
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,049
He is not who I was expected.

146
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,273
Well, he had the number.
- Harrison's dead.

147
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,423
What are you talking about?
- He overdid.

148
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,547
And who the fuck are you?

149
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,460
An electrician.
I was working in his house.

150
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,499
Give me your ID.

151
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,702
Did he tell you about this?
- I over heard him talking.

152
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,631
I knew he was waiting for a letter
and could be a lot of money.

153
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,581
So I took it and
followed the instructions.

154
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,484
You know what this is about?
- No.

155
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,656
No, no idea.

156
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,595
Follow me.

157
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,557
Do you think the cop saw him?

158
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,464
Maybe we should get out now.

159
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,166
If we leave and the cop show up.

160
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,477
Then the others that we think we rat it. We`ll be dead men.

161
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,486
Where you going?
- I should go in and talk to him.

162
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,051
Excuse me, gentlemen.

163
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:37,822
If the problem, me being here, then
I think I should leave.. I'll leave.

164
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,070
It's too late.

165
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,163
What If I dont want me here?

166
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,469
You have to play now.

167
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,649
600,000 on No 13.

168
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,563
Good luck.

169
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,209
Attention. The first round is about to begin.

170
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,527
Attention.

171
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,092
- I am asking the guards to please distribute the bullets.

172
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,596
One bullet to each player.

173
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:00,673
We are born only once
and we die only once.

174
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,613
You must be philosophical?

175
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,620
You are the descendent  from the great Schopenhauer.

176
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,546
Let all gamblers please step back.

177
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,183
Please gentlemen.. back up.

178
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,557
Backup.

179
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,698
Thank you, gentlemen.

180
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,166
Please.

181
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,642
Players.

182
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,502
Load your bullets into the cylinders.

183
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,096
What's going on 13?

184
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,497
Do you have a problem No.13?

185
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:30,164
No no no one gets up into the ring.
I`m asking you to step down immediately.

186
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:32,134
He doest know how to load his gun.

187
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,244
Enter.

188
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,982
Pay attention. Open it like this.. the bullet.

189
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:46,004
Alright, enough.

190
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,460
Take your places.

191
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,959
Raise your weapons.

192
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,031
Higher

193
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,426
I want to see them.

194
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:12,815
Spin your cylinders.

195
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,819
More. Go on, keep it up.

196
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:31,470
Aim.

197
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,573
cock your hammer.

198
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,505
No.13, no turning around.

199
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:53,546
Players, all eyes on the bulb .

200
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,520
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

201
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,208
Attention, nobody move.

202
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,878
No. 13 did not shoot.

203
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,756
Mr. Joe Carver, if your man does not shoot
We will.

204
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,328
And you will be fined.

205
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,198
What the fuck are you doing,
pull that trigger!

206
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,903
Shoot, shoot you son of a bitch.

207
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,905
I`m going to count to three.
- Shoot!

208
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:18,037
One
- Shoot.

209
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,738
Two.

210
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,410
Everyone, out of the ring.

211
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,987
- Are you done with your little drama?
- Fuck you.

212
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,232
This is the last time you
try to bullshit, you get it?

213
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,547
How much money they are paying you to watch my ass?

214
00:37:07,788 --> 00:37:10,937
What the fuck is it to you.

215
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,555
I'll give you 50 times more of
what they are giving you.

216
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,699
To get my ass out of here.

217
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,327
If you have that kind of money,
why the fuck did you come here?

218
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,335
What do you think I just
waltz in here?

219
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,866
These people kidnapped my ass.

220
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:32,373
You like money, huh?
How's two million sound?

221
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,676
You know what you can do with two millions, huh?

222
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:40,513
You can get high class pussies, fancy cars
all the bubbly shit you can think of.

223
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,090
I can do nothing for you sir.
I wont think about it.

224
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,377
Whats the matter? You dont like money?
- It's impossible.

225
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,793
Hey wait a minute, come on, come here.

226
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,419
My man is out, I want to bet on yours.
- Sure.

227
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,485
I take 50 points of the top,
just for this round.

228
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,171
Okay!

229
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,898
Want some more, Vin?
- No.

230
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,970
We all do it ...
- I said, no!

231
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:44,920
Hey, you lost your player, didn`t  you?
- Son of a bitch.

232
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,382
Sure you bet on the right man?

233
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:50,189
Dont worry about him,
He has what he needs.

234
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,932
Look I do not know what you deal with this guys.
I think i can deal you better.

235
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,802
60-40, 60 for you and 40 for me.

236
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,133
You have to bet at least 400,000.

237
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,966
Player number six, he is the most experience.

238
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,240
You know what I`m talking about?
- I know your player.

239
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,803
Make your offer,
I just made mine.

240
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,758
60-40 it is.

241
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,619
Place your bets, gentlemen.

242
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,373
All you up! beat them

243
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,485
Move it, lets go!

244
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:52,451
Now.

245
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,558
I said move it, lets go.

246
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:58,761
Get him on his feet, now.

247
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,594
You, get him on his feet.

248
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:06,265
On your feet, gentlemen. On your feet

249
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,269
Two bullets in each weapon.
Two bullets.

250
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:22,876
Players, load your bullets
into the cylinders.

251
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,530
Raise your weapons.

252
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,931
Higher.

253
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,766
Spin your cylinders.

254
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:58,285
Keep it up, Keep it up, faster..faster..faster.

255
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,925
Stop.

256
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,701
Aim.

257
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,338
Cock your hammers.

258
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,905
Dont look me in the eye.

259
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,924
Eyes on the bulb.

260
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:22,497
Out of the ring.
Drop your weapons, now.

261
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,360
You were lucky. The bullet is in the chamber
he didnt have time to shoot.

262
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:00,267
One more round and we are through.

263
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,862
Bring him to me.

264
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,040
Doctor, to the ring.

265
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,873
He cannot continue.

266
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:11,674
Hold on, hold on, this is a fucking game or a slaughterhouse?

267
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,209
My player didnt die in the game,
he is still alive.

268
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:21,551
What the hell was that.
- You know the rules.

269
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:30,149
Hans... Hans.

270
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:35,303
When you start something, you must
stay with it until the end.

271
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,308
Nobody forced
you to do this.

272
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,271
You got two for two.

273
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,516
You are great. You are great

274
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:11,140
How much you won
for the first two rounds?

275
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,792
2.9 million.

276
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:23,107
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me...

277
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:25,805
You need to pick your number.

278
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,671
what you got?

279
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:35,757
We'll be standing behind plate 13.

280
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:43,833
I'll bet the 2.9. plus an additional 1.2.

281
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:50,512
If you make it to the end,
you make a lot of money.

282
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,975
What the fuck do you care?

283
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:59,664
Just making conversations.

284
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:17,353
Three millions, okay? Three millions

285
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:20,627
I'll give you three million dollars.

286
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:24,698
- That could change your life forever.
- How do you plan to get all this money?

287
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:31,684
Listen, me and a couple of my boys,
we hit this armored car in Mexico.

288
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,563
My two partners got blown away.

289
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:37,385
I got away for about a day and a half.

290
00:46:37,386 --> 00:46:41,105
I had enough time left to get rid
of the truck and hid the money.

291
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:45,398
If you got that kind of money,
how is it they let you out of prison?

292
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,536
You`d have shove that gold mine for them.

293
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:55,436
They beat my ass but I didnt talk, okay.

294
00:46:55,479 --> 00:47:00,898
I didnt say a goddamn word, if i said so
maybe they would have smoke my ass and take the money.

295
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,842
I got the money
I got a lot of fucking money.

296
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:10,274
You finish the game and you'll leave
peacefully. In any case theres no way you escape.

297
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,156
They'll blow both of us before we get to the front door.

298
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,864
You get a better chance
to survive in the ring.

299
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,437
Just give me something to write.

300
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,010
- I want my money.
- Dont worry about the money.

301
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:01,144
It is important that you go it all the way.

302
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,515
It's pretty fucked up, huh?

303
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:11,455
These two are brothers.

304
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,404
I hate that fucking number.

305
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,119
Calm down.

306
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,996
- Just let it go.
- Calm down a little bit.

307
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,586
Forget about it

308
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,085
You shot two already.
You shoot three you get a bonus.

309
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,598
Aha. That would be wonderful.

310
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:09,420
- How much do I have?
- 1.1 million.

311
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:25,000
Listen man. I got all the details of where
I buried all the money in this little map here.

312
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:30,866
Listen me, man. I got a son.

313
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:35,881
He's doing some time. He got
another 18 months to go..so..

314
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,962
If anyhing happens to me,
if I dont make it out of here...

315
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:48,050
Take this note this out of pocket, go get their money

316
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:53,606
- We got a deal?
- Okay you got it.

317
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,504
Thirteen.

318
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,264
No.6

319
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,536
No.3

320
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,549
You can take him now.

321
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:22,106
You're going down.

322
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,404
What the fuck do you want?

323
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:28,298
Alright, enough.

324
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,623
Why isnt your player in the ring?
He must step up immediately.

325
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,733
- He will be there..he will be there
- The third round is about to begin.

326
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:57,181
What is wrong with him?
- Just another case of the rottens.

327
00:51:57,216 --> 00:51:59,479
Get him up there.

328
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:12,559
Give him his gun.

329
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:25,530
For the third round,
I will ask the guards ...

330
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:30,840
To distribute three bullets to each player.

331
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:33,715
Three bullets.

332
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,666
Sir, please.

333
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:56,570
Can I have a chair for my player?
He's not feeling too well.

334
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:05,581
He wants a chair for number three.
He can hardly stand up.

335
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:08,045
Get him a chair.

336
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,331
Thank you.

337
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:32,415
Players, load the bullets
in there cylinders.

338
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:48,240
Raise your weapons.

339
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,326
Spin your cylinders.

340
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,035
Stop.

341
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,771
Aim.

342
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:27,738
All players eyes on the bulb.

343
00:54:56,994 --> 00:55:01,157
Out of the ring.
Collect the weapons.

344
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:19,206
Gentlemen, we are in the
last stage of our game.

345
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:21,468
The duel.

346
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,555
On the table there a 5 bullets.

347
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,347
Three white, two black.

348
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:33,461
The blacks will designate the duelists.

349
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:41,956
I will now call the gamblers representing No 6,
9, 13, 17 and 3.

350
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:56,364
I will ask that you unwrap the bulbs high above
your heads so that everyone can see.

351
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:59,172
Gentlemen, good luck.

352
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:28,419
Gentlemen, place your bets.

353
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:30,995
Wa..wait.

354
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:35,469
I'll accept any offers under 85%.
Nothing less than 300,000.

355
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,577
Hey, let him go.

356
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:26,969
What the fuck are you doing?
Nobody tortures a survivor. Nobody.

357
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:34,866
Fuck. You know that story I told you
about all that money.

358
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:38,047
All that money I told you about, huh?

359
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:43,041
All that money you think you going to be hold unto it.
Huh huh. All that money...

360
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:48,299
You think you're man enough to hold onto Jimmy,
Would be your dick.

361
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:52,720
Okay son. Happy trails partner.

362
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:05,506
What's going on between you two?
- I just want to get the fuck out of here.

363
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:09,187
Get dressed and come get your money.
You are free to go.

364
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:55,114
Happy trails to you '.
Until we meet again.

365
00:58:55,863 --> 00:59:04,744
Happy trails to you, motherfuckers,
until we meet again. Happy trails to you

366
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,863
Mr. Grubber, I would like to bet on your boy.

367
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,565
Our player has no experience
and at this stage of the game its important.

368
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:29,146
- How much do you want?
- I want 80%

369
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:32,137
No.. no.. no, that's too much.

370
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:34,826
The two brothers are not offering you much better.

371
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:40,307
Beside we launch up five to one.
You'll need more money, everyone is betting on them.

372
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:48,065
Alright, we will do business.

373
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,359
It's almost time Ronald.

374
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:08,873
If this works out well Jasper,
I want my fucking share.

375
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:14,961
Of course.
But theres not a lot of people bet on us.

376
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:21,825
- We're not going to make that much money.
- Shut your fucking mouth, Shut your fucking mouth!

377
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,821
I fucking know you.

378
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,597
I know you.

379
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:47,377
I've been.... thinking a lot, lately.

380
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,443
What are you talking about?

381
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:05,900
Mommy and daddy left you
enough money to look after me.

382
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:14,162
You stucked me in that fucking hospital.

383
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,570
The hospital costs a lot of money.

384
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,571
You've all money on me
playing this fucking game, these past years.

385
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:34,121
You are a fucking  wiseter.
- That's horseshit.

386
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:38,245
Well I am but I said it now.
and I want my fucking money.

387
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,571
Against the wall.

388
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,310
Against the wall.

389
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,480
- Shift.
- What?

390
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:06,176
less too fucking times too big.

391
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,357
All the same.

392
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,450
One.

393
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,453
Two.

394
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,457
Three.

395
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,530
- Good for you?
- okay.

396
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,451
Players to the center of the ring.

397
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,435
Raise your weapons.

398
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,679
Spin the cylinders.

399
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,441
Cock the hammers

400
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:17,956
Eyes on the bulb.
When it lights up, you'll shoot..

401
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:15,831
Attention gentlemen, the duel will continue.

402
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:21,391
I ask for an additional bullet in each cylinder.

403
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:27,711
One, two, three, four.

404
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:39,138
One, two, three, four.

405
01:05:52,842 --> 01:05:56,016
Players, please step forward.

406
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,688
Raise your weapons.

407
01:06:11,332 --> 01:06:14,387
Spin your cylinders.

408
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,265
Stop.

409
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,982
Aim.

410
01:06:41,016 --> 01:06:42,657
Cock your hammers.

411
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:49,878
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

412
01:07:15,962 --> 01:07:20,107
Heh heh.. thats when the odds are against me.

413
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,107
Gentlemen. The game is over.

414
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:37,434
It`s finished.

415
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:46,136
And the winner is number 13.

416
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,479
Congratulations, 13. Congratulations.

417
01:08:01,104 --> 01:08:05,152
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck up.

418
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:25,445
Well done, man. Well done.

419
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,716
Have a seat..

420
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:04,984
Congratulations, 1 million 850 thousand dollars.

421
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,630
You realize how lucky you are?

422
01:09:09,665 --> 01:09:12,204
Your opponent won the last three duels.

423
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,913
- Are you satisfied?
- Yeah.

424
01:09:29,654 --> 01:09:32,318
If You want we can give you a ride.

425
01:09:32,353 --> 01:09:36,268
- Where?
- It doesnt matter.

426
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:40,664
We can drop you off at the
nearest train station..if you like.

427
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:46,098
Yeah, I get my things and
meet you downstairs.

428
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:51,084
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

429
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:59,217
- Where you going?
- I'm going with him.

430
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,603
You get into the room get our coats.

431
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,605
So your total's going to be 38.

432
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:10,320
Thank you.

433
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,968
Yes,this is  Claudio, the cab driver from yesterday.

434
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:45,742
Yeah I just saw your guy
he's out at the station.

435
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:42,043
We are in the station.

436
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:16,216
He is on your side. Thats your guy, that's him.

437
01:14:16,316 --> 01:14:17,955
Blue jacket, seated.

438
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,079
Excuse me sir, can you come with us.

439
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:41,270
- You want him uncuffed?
- uncuff.

440
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:51,029
Leave us alone. Thank you.

441
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,846
Where did you hide the money?

442
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:10,204
What are you talking about?

443
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:14,568
Sit down.

444
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:19,373
I said sit down.

445
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,886
You are not under arrest, Vincent.

446
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:33,809
And you wont be if you tell me everything
I want to know back there.

447
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:38,527
I've never met him.
- Dont bullshit me.

448
01:15:39,804 --> 01:15:42,552
I`m telling the truth.

449
01:15:42,587 --> 01:15:46,672
Why did they picked you at the intersection
if they were looking for Harrison?

450
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,111
The driver didnt know Harrison.

451
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:54,126
When he pulled up,
I flashed him a signal.

452
01:15:54,127 --> 01:15:55,858
A signal?

453
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:58,882
A piece of cardboard with a number.

454
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:15,678
- Where did he drop you?
- Somewhere in a forest.

455
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,072
What happened?

456
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,982
When we got there two other guys
were in another car.

457
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:26,404
When they saw me,
I knew I was screwed.

458
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:31,564
I told them Harrison was dead.
and I was going to take his place.

459
01:16:31,664 --> 01:16:36,105
But they didn't go for it, either they didnt believe
me or whatever.

460
01:16:36,106 --> 01:16:37,973
They didnt want me there.

461
01:16:38,669 --> 01:16:43,263
I saw one of the men had a gun,
when he reached for it, I reacted.

462
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,365
I ran and I just kept running.

463
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,707
- Did they chased you?
- They chased me, they shot at me.

464
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,134
But I just kept running.

465
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:58,876
I ran so hard that I lost a heel on my shoes.

466
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,451
If you saw them again, would you
be able to identify them?

467
01:17:14,913 --> 01:17:17,239
Of course.

468
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:20,769
Could you take me to that place
in the forest?

469
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:24,542
I was in a panicked.
I've been running for hours.

470
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:28,761
It was dark. How do fuck do you
expect me to remember where I was?

471
01:17:28,762 --> 01:17:32,903
But if we took you to that intersection,
you get your bearing, right?

472
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:38,465
The driver blindfolded me.

473
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,856
You're lying.

474
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,084
I`m telling the truth.

If you are not home,
Have Clara wait for it, okay?

What do you mean money? From where?

Just make sure somebody is home.

You're scaring me, Vincent.
Are you in trouble?
