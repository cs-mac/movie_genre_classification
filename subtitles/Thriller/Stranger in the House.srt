1
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,770
When are you leaving?

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,530
Did you think I didn't know?

3
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,230
Even Duk Shim could tell you were leaving.

4
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,970
After I resolve the land matter.

5
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,870
Everything aside,

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,370
it's a good decision for your life's sake.

7
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,730
Can't you be a little sad?

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,900
You seem too happy.

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,830
I want you to have a good life. That's why.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Leave Seulgi-ri and live freely.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
There she comes.

12
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,870
Where did you all go without
anyone to watch the place?

13
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,870
Na Ri.

14
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,129
Your father is all frozen...

15
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,000
from waiting all day.

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,499
I heard Na Ri's father...

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,900
was a con man who kidnapped
her for the land.

18
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,376
How long did you wait?

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,830
We just got here.

20
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,100
You should greet your elders.

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,269
Let's go inside.

22
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,400
It's okay. Maybe it's
my time for me to die.

23
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,869
I keep seeing Hong Dumplings in my dreams.

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,530
I came to take a look.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,000
It's changing drastically every year.

26
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,629
He can't handle the cold at
the nursing home anymore.

27
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,830
He even got frostbites.

28
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,199
Welcome, Sir. Let's go inside.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,670
Hey, Ko Nan Gil.

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,630
If you keep closing the
store, you'll lose customers.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Do you have dumplings pre-made?

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,206
They have good business. They
were even on television.

33
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,700
There's no need to scold him.

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,029
Go inside and take a look.
I'll take in your luggage.

35
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,500
- Are you telling me to be quiet?
- Dad.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,830
- Go and show them around.
- Okay.

37
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,830
If you're going to leave, be more sensible.

39
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't act like you're his son-in-law.

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,770
You already heard what
that man did to Na Ri.

41
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,630
He's still her father.

42
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,130
Gosh.

43
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,070
You're moving me to tears.

44
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,869
You should've been good to her before.

45
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,170
Be quiet.

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,600
The kids can hear you.

47
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
(Duk Shim)

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,729
What brings you to call me at this hour?

49
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,300
Why won't you tell me Dad's number?

50
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,700
Really?

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,299
Yes, the chairman is feeling better.

52
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,799
Na Ri's father came.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,629
I see. Thank you.

54
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,330
They say it's been 20 years.
That's ridiculous.

55
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,170
I don't want to live like that.

56
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,600
Give me his number.

57
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,600
All right. Bye, now.

58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,730
Duk Shim wanted to know how you were doing.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,500
Do you think I would buy that?

60
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,000
She told me Na Ri's father
came back to Hong Dumplings.

61
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,430
- Who?
- Na Ri's father.

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,130
Hurry up and get me discharged.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Right now?

64
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,799
Duk Bong is threatening to sue you.
It's too early.

65
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,670
Tell Mr. Kim to call in the company lawyer.

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Okay.

67
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,429
You should stay beside your father.

68
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,070
What can the three of us talk about?

69
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,630
How did they even think about coming here?

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,930
What if they ask to stay in this room?

71
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,770
I'll drive them back to Seoul.

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,670
There's no need.

73
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,299
If it's too hard to look at
Mother's belongings, go.

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,470
I'll do it.

75
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,300
Let's not touch them.

76
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,870
We started, so I'll finish.

77
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,899
- Do you know how strange this is?
- What is?

78
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,299
We're cleaning up Mom's room...

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,330
and we're worried about where to put Dad.

80
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,700
It's as if we've been married
for 10 years. It's weird.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Thank you for helping Dad get here.

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,129
I just did what I should do.

83
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,199
You can go...

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I'll...

85
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,400
drive you home.

86
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,400
Yes. You should go.

87
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,529
Hey, do you live here?

88
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,000
No, there is a room beside the restaurant.

89
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,570
Okay.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
So he's insisting on
following this blueprint?

91
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,830
The chairman is so arrogant.

92
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,699
I heard that he just
summoned the company lawyer.

93
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,930
Did he get discharged?

94
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,900
What is he scheming now?

95
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,169
I'll get going.

96
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,600
I heard Na Ri's father
came to Hong Dumplings.

97
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,070
Ms. Kwon, do you know Hong Sung Kyu?

98
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,770
- No.
- No.

99
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,470
I knew you'd say that.

100
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,300
You're so predictable.

101
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,630
If you're tired, you should go rest.

102
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,370
I'm not tired at all.

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,670
You brought a big luggage with you.

104
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,470
Do you have any other clothes?

105
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,070
What's wrong with this one?

106
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Hey. Does Mom's favorite...

107
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,700
tofu merchant still come at the same time?

108
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,770
It's old news, isn't it?

109
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,500
Why did you leave Mom and I?

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,930
I have no excuse.

111
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,700
Granny Oh Rye told me...

112
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,170
that you and Mom...

113
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,470
fell apart after you took me on a trip.

114
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,270
Where did we go back then?

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,770
To your mom's parents' house.

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,140
I see.

117
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,530
I can't remember anything else...

118
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,930
except for seeing a plane.

119
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,970
That was my first flight.

120
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,140
Do you...

121
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,500
still remember that?

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
You visited the restaurant
a year ago, right?

123
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,400
I was surprised when I read the note.

124
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,400
How did you know?

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,640
Someone took a picture and I saw you in it.

126
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,299
Na Ri's father was curious,
so I visited time to time.

127
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,599
Since when?

128
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What?

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,430
Well...

130
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,400
Let's see...

131
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,139
When was it again?

132
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,970
Was it after Mother passed away?

133
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,999
I wasn't going to say this,

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,369
but Na Ri's father is really mad.

135
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,269
He's just not saying it out loud.

136
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,000
Da Da kept telling me...

137
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,829
that Ko Nan Gil took...

138
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,139
Na Ri's land and the restaurant.

139
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,200
That's why I told her father.

140
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,969
Then he told he had to
see her right away...

141
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,530
and started to pack.

142
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,229
He wanted to get the land back...

143
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,270
and kick you out from Hong Dumplings.

144
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,330
- That took a while.
- Where is your father?

145
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
He's sleeping.

146
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,970
What are you doing here by yourself?

147
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm trying to clear my
head from all the mess.

148
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,700
Tell me what you're thinking about.

149
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,530
Should I accept Dad?

150
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,500
Should I take care of him forever?

151
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,100
I think that's unfair.

152
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,430
Mom must have been too
nice to kick him out.

153
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,169
What is family about?

154
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,829
Your poor brain is
suffering because of you.

155
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,830
There's more.

156
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,570
I told him to live freely,

157
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
but I don't want Nan Gil to leave.

158
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,010
Maybe we shouldn't have gone on the trip.

159
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,470
Things like that.

160
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm just saying it.

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

162
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,650
I'll teach you how to make dumplings.

163
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,730
If you focus on something,
you'll forget it all.

164
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,629
You need to press on it evenly.

165
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,246
Why are they all different sizes?
Make it even.

166
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,970
Stop being so serious.

167
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,899
Are you going to hire me?

168
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,770
You have mood swings because
you think too much.

169
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,769
Dad can't stay at home all the time.

170
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,130
Maybe he should learn
how to make dumplings.

171
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,470
Don't.

172
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,400
- Don't do that.
- Na Ri.

173
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,669
Welcome.

174
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,670
Hello.

176
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,230
It's just as I had built it.

177
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,400
That's a lie. Boss and I renovated it.

178
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,830
How many owners are there anyway?

179
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,170
Mr. Original Owner,

180
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,290
you must be reminiscing about the past.

181
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,830
Would you like to try
making some dumplings?

182
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,870
What about kneading dough?
We're doing it now.

183
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,370
Kneading dough?

184
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,430
You see.

185
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,570
I have bad eyesight, so I
don't do that kind of stuff.

186
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,570
Hey, why do you always seem to avoid me?

187
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,899
I wasn't avoiding you. I was doing my job.

188
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,660
Are you going to keep
on talking back at me?

189
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,999
Why is my daughter living here jobless?

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,430
And why are you living here?

191
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you penniless and homeless?

192
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,370
Where's all the money
earned from the restaurant?

193
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,700
Are you actually giving it to my daughter?

194
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,199
Let's discuss this after I get off work.

195
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,300
Work? You actually call
making dumplings work?

196
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,946
The fact that the person who
made my eyes like this...

197
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,500
is living here just
absolutely drives me crazy!

198
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,076
This property is Na Ri's and my land.

199
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,800
This restaurant is also mine.

200
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,270
Father.

201
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,500
If you have any questions, ask me.

202
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,529
If you're bored, make some dumplings.

203
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,700
No, no.

204
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,900
How could an old man with bad
eyesight make dumplings?

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
I think I'll go and get some rest.

206
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,430
It's so annoying being
caught between you two!

207
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,570
I wonder what our lawyer
is up to these days.

208
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,070
Why do you always dress like that?

209
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,730
What brings you here along
with the company lawyer?

210
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,370
If you continue to turn down
the developing project,

211
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,670
you give me no choice but
to report Na Ri's father.

212
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,400
A busy man like you has time to do that?

213
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,399
The statute of limitation
for the 20-year...

214
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,699
claim-obligation relationship has expired.

215
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,200
He issued a false death
report to hide his identity.

216
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,499
Fabrication of official
documents violates...

217
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,400
Article 225 of Criminal Law and is...

218
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,429
a serious felony that applies
to 10 years in prison.

219
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,330
I don't know what he's
thinking by showing up here.

220
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,600
He's a downright con-artist.

221
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,846
Trouble will only ruin your
relationship with Na Ri.

222
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,246
Build the resort and try
downsizing the park.

223
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,370
Don't act like you care about me.

224
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,530
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?

225
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,230
How much longer do I have to
put up with your grudges?

226
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,170
Was it my fault your
marriage got called off?

227
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,430
In the end, it was you who chose me!

228
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,730
I'm not taking your side this time.

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,300
I think...

230
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,930
I'll have to go meet Hong Na Ri.

231
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,400
Chairman Kwon, don't you
dare go near Na Ri.

232
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,730
If you do, I assure you I'll lose my mind.

233
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,070
I'm giving up the park.
What more do you want?

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,300
Ms. Kwon!

235
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,030
Why are you calling Ms. Kwon now?

236
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,370
It's as if we've been married
for 10 years. It's weird.

237
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,900
Why did he bring such a
large bag with no clothes?

238
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,230
You saw my father's clothes, didn't you?

239
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,770
He must have worn the same
clothes for 20 years.

240
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,400
Why are you laughing?

241
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,816
When you mention your father,
it reminds me of that.

242
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,899
Of what?

243
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,840
That it's as if we've been
married for 10 years.

244
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,300
I take it back.

245
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,100
There was no dating period
needless to say romance.

246
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,446
Stop telling your father to make dumplings.

247
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,499
Why?

248
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
Your father has never
made dumplings before.

249
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,870
- How do you know?
- Your mother told me.

250
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,970
As a child, I liked going to the market,

251
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,900
so my mother would always take me with her.

252
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,969
The dumplings I had at the market...

253
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,070
tasted the same as the
ones at Hong Dumplings.

254
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,899
Your father bought dumplings
from the market...

255
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,340
to sell at Hong Dumplings
without your mom's knowing.

256
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,210
It's a shameful history of Hong Dumplings.

257
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,200
I guess you used to like
markets and crowded places.

258
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,270
- What if...
- You said you don't like subjunctives.

259
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,670
What if you met me when I was with Mom?

260
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,570
I practiced for that kind
of situation just in case.

261
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,770
Hello, Na Ri. Nice to meet you.
My name's Nan Gil.

262
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,769
It's a good thing we never crossed paths.

263
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,669
Your first impression of
me wasn't good anyway.

264
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,870
No, that's not true.

265
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,970
Snake! Watch out!

266
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,500
- Where?
- I'm just saying to beware of snakes.

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,030
What? Did he just fool me?

268
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,340
I'll see you again.

269
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
Whatever.

270
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,106
Watch out! A wild boar!

271
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,340
There's a wild boar!

272
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,200
It was a prank my mother
used to play on me.

273
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,200
I wondered how you played the same prank.

274
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,899
"Maybe my mother sent you to cheer me up."

275
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
That's what I thought.

276
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,840
I never thought you'd be my stepdad.

277
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,670
Let's change the subject.

278
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,269
This is a video I saw at home
when I had my phone off.

279
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,730
- Do you want to see it?
- Sure.

280
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,630
(Neighborhood Friend)

281
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
I can't wait.

282
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
- What are you having?
- I want kimchi dumpling.

283
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,470
Go in.

284
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,130
Did you learn about Hong
Dumplings on television?

285
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,630
We dropped by after
visiting the Robot Museum.

286
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,670
Oh, the Robot Museum!

287
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,170
Then I guess you'll come
whenever you visit the museum.

288
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,770
He'll drive away all our customers.
What is he doing?

289
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,300
Mr. Hong Sung Kyu.

290
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,400
Is that you, Soon Rye?

291
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
You know Chairman Kwon, don't you?

292
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,100
How is your health?

293
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,170
Cut the small talk and shut it.

294
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,840
I assumed you would come
to me if you were alive.

295
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,590
I'm sure you thought you
could claim this land...

296
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,339
now that Na Ri's mother died.

297
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,229
No, it's nothing like that.
I thought I should...

298
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,669
come back home at least once before I die.

299
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,200
How dare you talk back at me!

300
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,130
Just listen.

301
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,729
From now on, do as I say.

302
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,400
You see...

303
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,670
My eyesight is bad...

304
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,100
and I have the energy to obey your orders.

305
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,930
That's good news.

306
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,670
Now that you're spiritless,
you can turn yourself in.

307
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,370
Turn myself in?

308
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,900
Why is Ko Nan Gil claiming
the land to be his property?

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,230
It's all because you have been on the run!

310
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,430
Turn yourself in, get punishment
and recover your name.

311
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh my goodness!

312
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,770
Go to prison in this cold and at this age?

313
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,100
My son is going to want to meet you.

314
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,846
He says he has feelings for your daughter.

315
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,769
He volunteered to be Na Ri's attorney.

316
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,270
I just can't stand it.

317
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,830
Cooperate with investigations
and do your time.

318
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,130
After that, transfer the
property under your name.

319
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,330
I don't know how I ended
up being your attorney,

320
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,070
but the documents say your
dad passed away 5 years ago.

321
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,570
How did you know?

322
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,470
Forging official documents
will land you in prison.

323
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,300
What has your father been doing?

324
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,670
Normal people can't do this.

325
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,229
She hasn't seen him in 20 years.

326
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,670
How would she know?

327
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,769
Exactly. Why did he suddenly
surface after 20 years?

328
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,670
He said he saw the
restaurant in his dreams.

329
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,000
The winter is tough for him.

330
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,170
You're so understanding of
something so ridiculous.

331
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,930
What a good daughter.

332
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,970
Then what should I do? Tell
him to turn himself in?

333
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,700
People like him don't turn themselves in.

334
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
- Na Ri.
- Yes?

335
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,130
I'll think about it.

336
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,769
- And Nan Gil.
- What?

337
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,300
Let's settle things.

338
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,200
I won't build the resort on Na Ri's land,

339
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,100
so change the deed to her name.

340
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,330
And I will quit being her attorney.

341
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,000
Why do I get this feeling
he'll cause trouble?

342
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,330
Hey.

343
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,270
Where did my daughter and that punk go?

344
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,799
Sorry, but Boss doesn't
tell us where he goes.

345
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,270
Call him!

346
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,270
Who? Boss?

347
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,130
Get me a cab.

348
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,299
A cab?

349
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,929
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,270
Duk Shim, would you take over?

351
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,930
Hey. Give me money for cab fare.

352
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,930
How is he so shameless?

353
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,570
(Transfer of Ownership)

354
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,599
Hello?

355
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,230
- Ms. Hong Na Ri?
- Yes?

356
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,299
This is the police.

357
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,330
You're Hong Sung Kyu's daughter, correct?

358
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,500
I'll give him the phone. Talk to him.

359
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,930
Here you go.

360
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,970
Na Ri.

361
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,229
I didn't want to be on the run forever,

362
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,370
so I turned myself in.

363
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,870
They said this is the only
way to get my name back.

364
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,629
Why did you suddenly...

365
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,570
I hear it'll be easier for me...

366
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,430
if I have a lawyer.

367
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,569
My father turned himself in...

368
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,969
and needs a lawyer.

369
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,130
He turned himself in?

370
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,699
Let's go and find out what's going on.

371
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,599
We won't be able to once
the investigation starts.

372
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,830
I'll go today.

373
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,429
We'll go with you. You
said you're quitting law.

374
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,900
I'll go alone.

375
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,070
I was correct.

376
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,129
I wondered why I had so many flaws...

377
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,330
when my mom is a total angel.

378
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,729
This is all because of Dad's genes.

379
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,599
I'm moody, I get stressed easily,

380
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,930
and I make rash decisions.

381
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,799
Are you self-reflecting?

382
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,000
No. I'm blaming my genes.

383
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,900
You can't say that in front
of someone without parents.

384
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,930
Think positively. I'm actually kind of...

385
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,300
relieved now.

386
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,830
Because my dad, who's been
bugging you here, is gone?

387
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,800
He can do this much in order
to get his name back.

388
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,999
Should he live in hiding forever?

389
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,569
We could've discussed it first.

390
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,969
He could've changed his clothes.

391
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,030
I don't understand why he
went so suddenly either,

392
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,870
but don't worry. Trust Duk Bong.

393
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,300
You have a useful neighborhood friend.

394
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,930
This is what we have so far. Read it over.

395
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,470
Wow. You are good looking.

396
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,230
I wish you were my son-in-law.

397
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,470
My eyesight isn't very good.
I got hurt, you see.

398
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,270
I see.

399
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,630
What number son...

400
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,470
of Chairman Kwon are you?

401
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,570
You saw Chairman Kwon, didn't you?

402
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,129
No, I didn't.

403
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,869
You can't lie to me.

404
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,430
I'm not lying.

405
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,070
I saw him briefly when he
passed by Hong Dumplings.

406
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,999
Forging official documents is a felony.

407
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,300
You must be alert and answer honestly.

408
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,700
How long have you known my daughter?

409
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,800
You ran away with Na Ri when
she was young, didn't you?

410
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,130
You can be found guilty of
kidnapping your own child.

411
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,300
Chairman Kwon...

412
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,970
gave me airfare and made me do it.

413
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,900
Chairman Kwon...

414
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,470
tortured our family in order
to take that land from us.

415
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,630
Goodness. I never imagined
he still couldn't have it.

416
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,330
I won't sell this land.

417
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,570
But why have I never met you before?

418
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,706
I studied abroad.

419
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,370
You did?

420
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,870
You seem to be similar in
age to my son and daughter.

421
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,000
You could be neighborhood friends.

422
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,330
If you'd adjust the price...

423
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,070
It really isn't about the money.

424
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,700
I won't sell.

425
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,500
He tortured them all their lives.

426
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,930
How did it go?

427
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,800
He'll be back soon.

428
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
He turned himself in,

429
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,430
and he didn't commit any
crimes with his fake identity,

430
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,030
so he can pay a fine and
avoid serving time.

431
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,870
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

432
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
He can do that much in order
to get his name back.

433
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,330
Good thinking.

434
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,330
Thank you, Duk Bong.

435
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,730
Why did you make him turn himself in?

436
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,500
I agreed to eliminate his debt,

437
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,829
so he should do something for me.

438
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,730
What would a con man do?

439
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,430
You seem to resent me,

440
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,170
so I'm trying to get you
together with Na Ri.

441
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,730
Take care of it for him.

442
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
I know it's about the land.

443
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,470
I know you made Hong Sung
Kyu a debtor and kidnapper.

444
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,029
How dare you trust a con
man and give me lip?

445
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,529
You want him to recover his name...

446
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,730
and file a lawsuit to claim the land!

447
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,699
If you have no shame,

448
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,170
at least have a conscience.

449
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,069
You killed children...

450
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,600
and pretended like you didn't know.
And now,

451
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,070
must you steal that land, too?

452
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,330
That land...

453
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,700
was ours from the start.

454
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,230
It's right that we take it.

455
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,270
I didn't want to go this far,

456
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,100
but I swear I will make you stand trial.

457
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,570
(Hong Na Ri's Footsteps)

458
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,900
(Hong Na Ri's Footsteps)

459
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,869
Goodness. Maybe it's because
my heart is at peace,

460
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,930
but I am sleeping very well.

461
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,900
It's nice here.

462
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,170
Did you really come to turn yourself in?

463
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,030
That's what I said.

464
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,000
I heard you'll be released soon.
Hang in there.

465
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,470
Duk Bong will take care of it.

466
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,130
You know,

467
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,470
I really like that lawyer fellow.

468
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,729
He's nothing like Chairman Kwon.

469
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,870
He has a strong sense of responsibility.

470
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,100
He's perfect for you.

471
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,530
I was shocked at how quickly he ran over.

472
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,470
He likes you, doesn't he?

473
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,030
We're not like that.

474
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,270
I'll never approve of that punk, Nan Gil.

475
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,900
You have no right to say that.

476
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,369
Any time his name comes up,

477
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,630
you get worked up.

478
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,906
My father said to thank you.

479
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,800
I was really mean to him.

480
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,070
Your father seems to make
your life difficult.

481
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,430
You did good.

482
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,800
Nan Gil does it well, but I can't.

483
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,330
You have your mother's smile.

484
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,630
Sorry, that just came out.

485
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,200
Let's not go to Seulgi-ri.
Where should we go?

486
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,500
Na Ri.

487
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
It's nice seeing you outside of Seulgi-ri.

488
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,270
You look better here.

489
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,170
Don't quit your job.

490
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,630
To be honest, I didn't like Seulgi-ri.

491
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,070
I got bored after a day
and went back to Seoul.

492
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,629
I'm amazed that I'm doing fine there.

493
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,169
I feel guilty toward my mom.

494
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,470
You don't look happy there to me.

495
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,170
Do you know how conflicted you look?

496
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,770
It would be strange not
to be with two dads.

497
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,530
One is in a holding cell and
the other wants to leave.

498
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,030
I'm the only one who can protect Seulgi-ri.

499
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,030
Boss gave this to me.

500
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,900
This has the business
know-how for Hong Dumplings.

501
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,630
He told me to study it.

502
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,200
More shockingly, he wants
me to write in it now.

503
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,500
Why is he doing this to me?
Do I look studious to you?

504
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,999
- Oh my gosh.
- Must I...

505
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,306
take on this burden at this age?

506
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,429
Aren't you only a year younger than Mr. Ko?

507
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,630
No way. Really?

508
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,400
Nan Gil was just very mature.

509
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,800
We will take a vote, the democratic way.

510
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,030
If you'll stay even after Boss leaves,

511
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,770
touch your elbow to your mouth.

512
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,330
Spin 100 times.

513
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,740
No one?

514
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,000
We will all leave if Boss leaves.
It's unanimous!

515
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,740
Hong Dumplings is loyalty.

516
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,239
- Loyalty.
- Loyalty.

517
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,169
Again. Hong Dumplings is loyalty!

518
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,900
- Loyalty.
- Good.

519
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,070
Na Ri.

520
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,300
Go with me to a year-end party.

521
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,130
My friends throw a party every year.

522
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,570
It'll be embarrassing to go alone.

523
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,870
So be my partner.

524
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,270
I know someone who likes parties.

525
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,600
That someone already became
enemies with my friends.

526
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,769
Why?

527
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,330
She claims it's because they badmouthed me,

528
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,070
but they were probably just drunk.

529
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,300
I represented your fathers.
Aren't you grateful?

530
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,270
It should be a give and take.

531
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,900
Okay, Mr. Attorney.

532
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,100
It should be a give and take.

533
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,240
How immature.

534
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,946
Why... Why are you here?
Aren't you kneading?

535
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,200
Why are you stuttering? Do you feel guilty?

536
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,370
No.

537
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,270
You'll freeze to death,
trying to look pretty.

538
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,099
It's so cold. Mom, I'm here.

539
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,570
My precious daughter. Come in.

540
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,530
Let me see.

541
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,370
Look at you.

542
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,100
You'll freeze to death,
trying to look pretty.

543
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,300
First my stepdad, then my mom.
Stop confusing me.

544
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,500
What does that mean?

545
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,300
Sit down.

546
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,430
Here's the bankbook and
ledger for the restaurant.

547
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,099
Are you telling me to run Hong Dumplings?

548
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,430
It'll run itself.

549
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,270
Yong Kyu is managing the
ingredients and payroll.

550
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,330
Aren't you going to ask
where I went with Duk Bong?

551
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,030
Can't you tell I'm holding back?

552
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,170
You're so good at it.

553
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,130
But why are you holding back?

554
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,400
He's representing your father.
I can't say anything.

555
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,929
It wouldn't be like you watched a movie,

556
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,570
had tea, and had fun with him.

557
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,569
Anyway, I'm... I'm not
interested in looking at this.

558
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,930
- You're stuttering. You do feel guilty.
- I do not.

559
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,400
We watched a musical and had tea.

560
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,370
You don't need to tell me everything.

561
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Nan Gil.

562
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,329
Girls like Duk Shim may
follow you around in Seoul.

563
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,299
I didn't think of that. You
were fine taking the bus,

564
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,129
but now you can't go to
Seoul without Duk Bong.

565
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,306
- Just admit you don't like it.
- Be honest.

566
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,569
Say you don't trust me
living alone in Seoul.

567
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,799
Be honest and say my
neighborhood friend bothers you.

568
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,000
You're staying out all night
if you come past midnight!

569
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,700
How many times did you
come home early morning?

570
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Don't be unreasonable
after playing until now.

571
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,830
Don't act cool and then hold a grudge.

572
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,330
It's late, so go to sleep.

573
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,770
Let's talk later.

574
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,570
Look if you want to know
how to run the restaurant!

575
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,200
Nan Gil! You are so childish! Seriously!

576
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,970
Why did you say that?

577
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,600
Why did I say that?

578
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,170
Yeo Joo.

579
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,716
Na Ri. What are you doing here?

580
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,870
I waited for you after
my second consultation.

581
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,946
When are you coming back to work?

582
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,670
Why are you telling people
I'm coming back? I'm not.

583
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,470
You're determined to destroy me.

584
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,629
If you don't come back, I'll have to quit.

585
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,270
Like I'd believe you. You
have too much debt to quit.

586
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,240
- Come with me.
- Why?

587
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,930
If you don't want to return to work,

588
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,740
marry Nan Gil and save me.

589
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,470
- What?
- You took a leave to get married,

590
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,240
so get married for real.

591
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,770
How could you bring up marriage to me?

592
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,530
I'm busy. Keep it brief.

593
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,530
Duk Bong asked me to go with
him to a year-end party.

594
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,900
So I waited to ask you for
advice on a party dress.

595
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,100
I was clueless.

596
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,830
It wasn't because of Nan Gil.

597
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,169
I guess you heeded my warning.

598
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,170
I did.

599
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,999
Your warning really hit me. Thanks.

600
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Congratulations.

601
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,130
But Na Ri,

602
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,700
don't act high and mighty
in front of me anymore.

603
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,229
- What?
- You're just an average woman...

604
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,799
who weighed your options...

605
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,699
between Nan Gil and Duk
Bong and chose money.

606
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,400
My motto these days is to
become an average woman.

607
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,630
Stop acting uninterested,

608
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,900
and look up year-end party looks.

609
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,670
The internet is full of information.

610
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,630
Sit down.

611
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,550
I heard you ruined Duk
Bong's friends' party...

612
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,970
because they were badmouthing him.

613
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,630
I guess you talk about me behind my back.

614
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,600
I know you like him.

615
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,700
You're not one to ruin a party.

616
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,470
I won't steal him from you. Don't worry.

617
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,500
How do you feel right now?

618
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,569
You and Duk Bong weren't
dating, but you feel like...

619
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,030
I took him from you, so
you're upset and want to cry.

620
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,430
Don't forget that feeling.

621
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,529
The people you hurt...

622
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,706
suffered 100 times more than that.

623
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,830
Repent.

624
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,630
You are...

625
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,369
impossible to like.

626
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,670
Don't twist your words.

627
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,500
Is it my fault that you don't like me?

628
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,199
I'm too nice to say, "I hate you."

629
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,070
Then learn how to.

630
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,170
And if you like Duk Bong, do it your way.

631
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,970
Don't bother people around him.

632
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,999
Don't call me to your room.

633
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,070
It's like I'm being called
to the principal's office.

634
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,270
Here.

635
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,030
What's this?

636
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,530
Put it on.

637
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,630
Awesome.

638
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,130
They say the clothes make the man.

639
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,130
You look good. We'll have
to update our website.

640
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,970
Stand straight.

641
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,670
Can you do it?

642
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,100
I know it's painful for you. I do,

643
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,900
but think about us, too.

644
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,030
This isn't right.

645
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,729
You created this place.

646
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,530
Why are you running away?

647
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,770
Darn it.

648
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,430
He's so cool.

649
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,700
You told me...

650
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,929
if I let people take, they'll keep taking.

651
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,970
That those who take have no conscience.

652
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,750
So why are you letting them take from you?

653
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,500
There's no one on your side.

654
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,570
- I'm an evil boss.
- You're right.

655
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,300
You're an evil boss, but
your workers love you.

656
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,200
I went to the office for a consultation.

657
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,300
- Did you decide yet?
- No.

658
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,370
I said I'd think about it some more.

659
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,730
You have no respect for
your stepdad's opinion.

660
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,730
What happened to becoming an average guy?

661
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,200
Try living as Ko Nan Gil, not my stepdad...

662
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,630
or Hong Dumplings' owner.

663
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,500
How will you start it?

664
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,300
Ko Nan Gil.

665
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,670
How will you start?

666
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,369
We heard the rumor.

667
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,599
Can't we get a picture with you?

668
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,170
Of course, you can.

669
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,499
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

670
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
No, no. Thank you.

671
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,469
That's right. What did you order?

672
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,869
Kimchi. You wanted kimchi dumplings, right?

673
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,900
Nan Gil.

674
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,370
I don't know why I need
to relay this message,

675
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,670
but Na Ri's father asked
when you are leaving.

676
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,400
Your outfit is especially loud today.

677
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,030
Yes. I'm dressed for a party.

678
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,890
Don't you have any holiday
parties to go to?

679
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,000
(Hong Dumplings)

680
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,870
Will we have a love triangle in Seulgi-ri?

681
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,700
You look like you looked
forward to the party.

682
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,130
Duk Bong.

683
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,830
I can't go.

684
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,670
You didn't even give me
time to find a replacement.

685
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,169
It's not a serious event.

686
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,770
Just stay for a few minutes and then leave.

687
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm sorry.

688
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,999
Don't feel bad.

689
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,230
I don't need to bring a date actually.

690
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,369
I'll drop you off at home.

691
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,500
No, I want to go to Seoul...

692
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,230
to a friend's cafe.

693
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,600
Okay, then.

694
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,230
You'll date as a regular man and woman?

695
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,800
Don't make me laugh.

696
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,600
Hey. I won't say anything then.

697
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,929
I guess he has a conscience
after making you cry.

698
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,930
A conscience?

699
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,800
"Let's date. This is day one."

700
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,170
He beat around the bush
and asked indirectly.

701
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,930
Hey.

702
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,569
What could you possibly
have to say to me...

703
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,770
that you came to visit?

704
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:54,630
Father.

705
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,930
When Na Ri was young,

706
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,030
you took her and ran away for money, right?

707
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,830
Did you tell her that?

708
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,100
Are you here to threaten me?

709
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,570
I am not.

710
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,770
When time passes,

711
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,670
I'll get on my knees...

712
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,029
and tell her everything, so...

713
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,030
No.

714
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,970
Don't tell Na Ri.

715
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,300
She remembers it as her first flight.

716
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,600
It's also why she became
a flight attendant.

717
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,830
That's probably why Mother
never told her either.

718
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,900
Just let her keep it as the
memory of her first flight.

719
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,769
Hey, I need to go home.

720
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,029
You should go too.

721
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,030
No.

722
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,969
There goes Na Ri's specialty.

723
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,100
Sitting silently and thinking.

724
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,630
- Where are you?
- Why?

725
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,330
- I'm in Seoul.
- Why?

726
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,700
I'll pick you up. Come out.

727
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,730
Why?

728
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,369
You said to tell you if I don't like it.

729
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,630
I don't like you being there.

730
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,370
If Ran Sook hears you say you
don't like my being here,

731
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,100
it'll be three strikes for you.

732
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,730
What? He doesn't like you being here?

733
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,670
He doesn't like your being here?

734
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,330
I'm at Ran Sook's cafe.

735
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,500
Didn't you go to the party?

736
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,670
Okay. I'm coming. Wait for me.

737
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,900
Is something wrong?

738
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,930
You're the only person I
know who knows Na Ri.

739
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,870
You have Duk Shim.

740
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,630
You're right.

741
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,830
I'm sure if she saw me now, she'd say,

742
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,700
"Awesome."

743
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,770
Okay. Don't beat around the bush.

744
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,870
Tell me what happened. I'll listen.

745
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,830
I'm not in the mood to talk.

746
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,300
Then why am I here?

747
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,500
I know.

748
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,070
After I called you, I
suddenly want to be alone.

749
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,900
Duk Bong. Don't be like this to me.

750
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,970
You look cool even when you act lonely.

751
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,470
Is that what you expected?

752
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,100
I'll search and read to you...

753
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,230
things to console a man who's been dumped.

754
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,570
How to...

755
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,730
You're just like Duk Shim.

756
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,370
My gosh.

757
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:10,700
I've never met up with a guy
dressed like this before.

758
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:15,070
It's the first time a guy
came to my dad's hospital.

759
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,330
We'll really end up being friends.

760
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,946
Found it. Should I read it to you?

761
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,030
It's okay.

762
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,130
You weren't dumped. You never even dated.

763
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,669
"Most guys become furious
when they are dumped."

764
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,030
I said it's okay.

765
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,700
"And whom is he enraged?"

766
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,970
"Most guys turn the blame..."

767
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,500
"on the woman."

768
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,270
I'll tell you what happened, so stop it.

769
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,000
Did you have dinner yet?

770
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,070
Why didn't you go to Duk Bong's party?

771
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,130
I'm grateful and sorry toward him,

772
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,400
but I felt like I'd feel worse if I went.

773
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:23,100
I realized why our feelings
were so complicated.

774
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,930
Now, all that remains is
the situation between us.

775
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Nan Gil, why do you want to leave?

776
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,670
So you can get together with Duk Bong.

777
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,630
I wish it were something
that cool, but it isn't.

778
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,300
Now that your dad returned,
I felt like I was...

779
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,076
being unreasonable
insisting it was my house.

780
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,130
I felt uncomfortable and insecure.

781
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,900
I wanted to find my own place.

782
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,399
Something like that.

783
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,630
So what? Will you shake it
all off and find your place?

784
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,400
Don't make it sound so easy.

785
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,200
Let's go.

786
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,870
Answer me.

787
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,430
Na Ri.

788
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,030
Thank you for being here
instead of going to the party.

789
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,230
Na Ri.

790
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,230
You don't like dumplings, do you?

791
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,870
Me? I do.

792
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,870
I know you don't.

793
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,629
You don't like dumplings,

794
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,906
and your dad sold dumplings
he bought from the market.

795
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,069
And Mother's dumplings...

796
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,230
Even my friends said they tasted bad.

797
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,500
They were right.

798
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,230
But now, people line up for Hong Dumplings,

799
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,670
and it's a famous eatery that was on TV.

800
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,430
What are you trying to say?

801
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,530
So the Hong Dumplings now...

802
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,800
was created by Ko Nan Gil.

803
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,800
Hong Dumplings is Hong
Na Ri's Hong Dumplings.

804
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,600
No, it's Ko Nan Gil's Hong Dumplings.

805
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,670
I've decided how to start.

806
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,100
I won't leave.

807
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,930
Hong Dumplings is where I belong.

808
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,330
I'll go on trips, make friends,

809
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,870
and visit Hong Na Ri who lives in Seoul.

810
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,930
Welcome to Ko Nan Gil's Hong Dumplings.

811
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,200
I need to check something.

812
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,300
We agreed to meet as a
regular man and woman.

813
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,670
But why did we never get any closer?

814
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,100
How many chances to kiss did we miss?

815
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,730
I stopped counting after a while.

816
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,300
I did that well.

817
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,730
- Don't do that.
- Na Ri.

818
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,770
Did you think about how
hard it was for me to stop?

819
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,870
It was hard for me too.

820
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,000
If you had left, you would've
disappeared from my life.

821
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,330
You said you'd wait, but
thought about so many things.

822
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,200
Regular men and women think
a lot when they date...

823
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,700
although it wasn't such a positive thought.

824
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,970
I almost disappeared from your life.

825
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,130
Welcome to my life.

826
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,929
(Sweet Stranger and Me)

827
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,469
I said to sleep at night. A
family should eat together.

828
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,069
Are you sure I was your first love?

829
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,269
You were. But I returned to the real world.

830
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,469
It'll be a pain to end your
relationship as family.

831
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,499
Just remain as neighborhood friends.

832
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,076
- I don't want to give up on her.
- I can't do it.

833
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,269
What if Father comes home?

834
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,129
Father, please don't mention
Duk Bong in front of me!

835
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,269
As you know, I'm Na Ri's man.

836
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,599
- Let's set a date.
- Don't touch my personal life.

837
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,669
And I'm dating someone!

838
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,499
What? Father? I'm meeting your father?

839
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,430
Hey, Nan Gil. This place hasn't changed.

840
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,730
Do you want to work here?

841
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,130
The first time I said how
I felt, I regretted it.

842
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,330
The second time, I thought
we could part ways.

843
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,670
Now, I promise to spend
every moment with you.

844
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,000
Na Ri.

845
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,230
Will you marry me?
